65431,solution  buy your parmesan  domestic or real  and grate it yourself tastes better too if you re really lazy  grate it and freeze until you need it,7,
65432,damn were becoming like china  next will have faked food,5,
65433,what kind of wood   are we talking the high quality organic stuff  or factory processed scrap wood  because goddamnit if they ve been slipping cheap wood shavings into my welfarecheese  we re going to have an fucking issue on our hands,4,
65434,lol  wood it is cellulose trying to get clicks,6,
65435,i m safe  source  only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti,3,
65436,i shred my own parmesan cheese  it makes worlds differenc,3,
65437,this is why i do nt buy nasty sargento cheese ever taste it  it tastes like wood  i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better,3,
65438,hmm i am pretty sure i misread that title,1,
65439,it s cheaper by the chunk anyways,1,
65440,similar to olive oil  most parmesan cheese is nt even parmesan cheese,1,
65441,my parents always called it cardboard chees,1,
65442,it still taste oh so goooooooood,1,
65443,if it tastes good  i do nt care,1,
65444,pene means weiner in spanish that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood,1,
65445,maybe they are just trying to get people to eat a whole door over the course of a year,1,
65446,just buy the blockwedge and grate your own,1,
65447,gt  she faces up to a year in prison  so  what re you in for blondie    just beat me up and get it over with,1,
65448,cellulose is indeed an anti clumping agent if they use more and it does not change taste  i am ok with it at least it has less calories  ,,
65449,if you buy preshredded or grated cheese  you deserve to eat wood,,
65451,shout out to the iraqis for getting our guys back saf,6,
65453,yes please too big to fail means they are too big  period break them apart,8,
65454,this seems like a no brainer not saying it will be easy  but why ever have banks too large to fail even exist,9,
65455,absolutely agree  but it will likely go nowhere it really is nt any different than when the government stepped in and broke up atamp  t into the baby bells unfortunately  this is talk by those who have no power to enforce change,6,
65456,seems like a good move if you re too big to fail  you are clearly in violation of antitrust and monopoly legislation  surely  plus  anything that is too big to fail is clearly just a bad idea from the standpoint of a societies ability to sustain unexpected shocks and surprises,7,
65457,big banks and wall street bank elections for both parties not going to happen unless supreme court reverses  citizens united  ruling allowing corporations to donate unlimited amount of funds to politicians and political parties as long as such bribery is legal  no politician will bite the hand that feeds himher,5,
65458,this is a political talking point floated to make sanders look like an over reactor if andor when he loses the nomination this guy and his idea will disappear from sight,6,
65459,hopefully  his floating that idea wo nt end up with him floating in the river,4,
65460,kashkari  eh  so  how does goldman sachs make money off of this,4,
65461,eh  wake me when they actually start breaking them up for now this is just more idle talk,4,
65462,i guess they could nt find a picture that makes him look crazier,4,
65463,if there are any economists here  i have a question how do we know that this wo nt have the same results as breaking up telecoms  regional monopolies collude until one is more successful and one starts to fail the successful one buys the failing one then this process repeats until the most successful one is enormous again  but with writeoffs  layoffs and debts thanks to the less successful ones consumers get screwed by footing the bill for the whole failed experiment  if telecoms can do that  why would we assume that banks wo nt just do the same thing  to the effect of even more pain for consumers,4,
65464,oh hey  it s the guy who ran for california governor,3,
65465,news update  spontaneous fires erupt in rome,3,
65466,no if we break up banks or make them have more capital  they will invest less  and folks on reddit will say its too hard to get a loan the banks will now actually want to make sure folks can actually pay back the loan  and a lot of folks have no assets  and will cry its not fair   only the rich are getting the loans    since they already have assets   are you sure you want to hold banks accountable  personally  i think its a great idea  but not sure you all realize the banks will just push that accountability back on you,3,
65467,that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money,1,
65468,probably not that big of a problem anymore they ve plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 20 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become,1,
65469,looks as though he s beginning a political career as a goldman  fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him asshole,1,
65470,breaking up huge banks reduces the chance that banks will get the giant bailouts the did after 2008 failures  massive corporate welfare they will lobby hard against the potential loss of a free ride,1,
65471,godless commie socialism yes pleas,1,
65472, flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca nt fail  did anyone else see this   wtf  so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further,1,
65473,trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it,1,
65474,from my armchair  i d say that the entire banking sector needs to be deleveraged 301 leverage  or whatever it currently is  is too much slowly  over time  to prevent shocks from the deleveraging   deleverage the banks  and it would make it harder for a crisis to become systemic,1,
65475,kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying,1,
65476,kashkari was part of the paulson team that leveraged the american banking empire into toobigtofail and now that that leverage is proving to be dangerous for the survival of the one per cent kleptocrats he wants to break up the tbtf banks  geithner knew this would manifest when he used tbtf as a stopgap measure to save the synagogue of satan worshiping kleptocracy of fraudsters that run the federal reserve now that same kleptocracy wants to be bailed out once again because geithner s temporary solution has run it s course straight into the gutter where geithner amp  kashkari et al  belong  up yours  america the functional retard,,
65478,at least the guy was honest,1,
65479,i would nt be mad if it was my wallet,1,
65480,how do they know the guy was homeless,1,
65483,i have my own super secret private social network site that only i know about,6,
65484,so  i read the article and it appears the site was not created by anonymous but anonymous advocates the site  i believe facebook could use some healthy competition  though i question how private anyone s information can be on the internet  even with encryption it seems no matter how much you try to protect someone s information online  there is always someone who  with enough time and ingenuity  can obtain it,5,
65485,anyone else get the feeling this was an ad,4,
65486, doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  i have watched criminal minds penelope can do it,6,
65487,given the propensity of anonymous for leaking confidential and private information of people who do nt share their viewpoints  i do nt know how super private it would stay if someone expressed a contrary opinion would my belief that kanye is an immature narcissist result in release of the name and location of my virginity loss  or my 2nd grade teacher  btw  not the same person ,6,
65488,i bet tom from facebook is already a membe,3,
65489,gt  but unlike its competitors it doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  so how does it make money to pay for development  management  support  bandwidth  and servers  i do nt know how this shit gets reported slow news day  remember that stupid  social network  diaspora  they got global coverage about their facebook alternative i do nt think they ever even finished the product  let alone had anyone use it  must be built by the son of some important news editor who can drum up publicity this is likely the same,5,
65490,so if i log into reddit on the tor network and my verification email account  if i were to use one  was anonymous  would nt that be the same thing,3,
65491,facebook s shills are working overtime in this posts comments i hope this social media site becomes a viable alternative,3,
65492,private social media pick one,1,
65493,i love when people treat shit like this like news downvote it to where it belongs,,
65494,eh  with anonymous s history of doxxing people  i rather not use anything that they have a hand i,,
65495,so some social dropout  400 lb teenage hackers are going to be watching over other the private data of other people  i do nt think the anonymous group realizes how much they are despised across the internet,,
65496,i would trust this site over facebook,,
65498,yeah  in the middle of a forest also 53 is only a little above the normal ones we get almost every day somewhere in the state,7,
65499,paging utheearthquakegu,8,
65500,so the news headline here is  tiny earthquake occurs in expected location   exciting,7,
65501,california laughs at your pitiful magnitude 5 earthquakes,6,
65502,i m in fresno amp  i felt it ,5,
65503,im in east la  i didnt feel it   but watching news rite no,3,
65504,we call that tuesda,3,
65505,no news here only small towns in the owens valley and it was nt even a moderate temblor,1,
65506,little south of fresno and was outside and my neighbor came running out  did you feel that  so we ran and looked at my pool and the water was moving  pretty cool to see that,1,
65507,the big one is near and there is reason to fear,1,
65508,who cares oklahoma had a 51 the other day and it was nt even anything to write home about,,
65509,i moved away from california at the end of december this helps reinforce my decision as a good idea,,
65512,has nt he already had  like  two years to prevent this in the first place,8,
65513,lansing has actually dealt with this problem and their civil engineers have a solution which is both fast and more costeffective than traditional measures they connect the end of the new pipe to the old pipes so when they pull out the old pipe they simultaneously thread the new pipes into the existing space this speeds up the process and the people in lansing estimate with adequate training  involving them with the process in flint  and hiring enough crews it can be completed for flint in one year,6,
65514,this whole situation is a national embarrassment  and it makes my blood boil  but what does naacp have to do with city water  is it a race issue as well  i ve never seen the demographics on flint  come to think of it  maybe aspca should get involved  too i bet people are still feeding their pets city water no matter what  edit  i just think it should be about officials   doing their fucking jobs    framing it as a race issue might just come back to bite us  who knows how many towns are discreetly checking for  and finding  elevated lead  should it matter how many african americans live there  if so  how should officials proceed differently  will it result in a process of public relations triage  that prioritizes black communities  public officials just need to do their fucking jobs for the public they serve there s no need to complicate this with race,6,
65515,that s like threatening to get one of those online white house petitions going it does nt matter,4,
65516,fix flint s water pipes or they ll burn flint to the ground,3,
65517,i m all for getting this fixed as quickly as possible but i also do nt want something rushed either figure it out figure it out right,1,
65518,okayand then what  all of the protesting has nt done jack so far what s one more protest going to do  it s not going to make the state government move any faster  it s very clear that the government  at every level  is more concerned about covering itself a protest is nt going to change that,,
65519,sooooo glad i do nt live in flint  that place sounds like a complete disaster,,
65520,who the fuck are they to demand this  are whiteasianlatino people not allowed to be affected by this,,
65522,why did nt they care this much about their freaking  home   remember all those reporters and camera crews contaminating all that evidence after the shooting it was live on cnn ffs,7,
65523,i do believe they are nt understanding that the phone ca nt be decrypted by apple or anyone,7,
65524,even if they wrote a program to stop the wait time or not wipe phone after a certain amount of failed attempts  you would still need to get inside the phone to implement it,3,
65525,this is what the fbi was looking for  the one terrorist case it can trumpet to prove it needs to unlock anyone s phone at any time,1,
65526,why not just dump the phones firmware and then brute force it there  learn2nsa fb,1,
65527,under what law or authority can a third party company be compelled to take some action  other than testifying  in a criminal case  can the feds order a construction company to build a house  can they order a car manufacturer to build a custom version of a car,1,
65529,gt  a sixcount federal complaint out of nevada charges cliven bundy with conspiracy to commit an offense against the united states  assault on a federal law enforcement officer  obstruction of justice  interference with commerce by extortion and two counts of carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence  cliven bundy  you dumb fucktard  your time has arrived,3,
65530,cliven bundy and his patriot militia are a joke  now they are afraid to bend over for a bar of soap they thought with enough guns they would win thru intimidation  now  reality is sinking in  along with humiliatio,1,
65532,this is why a lot of former cops are setting up companies where they transport the cash for it it s also a huge motivation for the stores to keep 2 separate sets of books  a real one and one the irs gets to see,9,
65533,this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day,9,
65534,gt  one of the three men who escaped from a california jail last month had been charged with kidnapping a marijuana dispensary owner that they suspected had hidden large amounts of cash in the desert the man and his accomplices are accused of driving the dispensary owner out to the desert  torturing him and cutting off his penis  sheesh i m not carrying more than  10 in my wallet from now on  and that has nothing to do with the fact that i m broke,9,
65535,this is why they get robbed all the time out here no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys,7,
65536,ca nt these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us,8,
65537,there s a great documentary on netflix called  high profits  about a business in breckenridge  co right before full legalization took effect  one of the big issues was exactly this only being able to do business in cash from payroll to paying city taxes they had  120k in cash they had to just walk into the front of the city building with and that was just the first month alone  some of the people that make the drops to the shops are walking out with  10k in their pockets and no security at all it s terrifying,8,
65538,civil forfeiture time,6,
65539,ironically  it s also just flat out illegal to own large sums of money anything over a few hundred bucks  and the government can sieze that money  because the money committed the crime of intent to purchase narcotics,9,
65540,time to start using gold,5,
65541,so the tax man will gladly take cannadollars  but the banks will not this is ridiculously stupid,5,
65542,same deal in washington still have to buy my shit with cash oh but i can buy cigs and alcohol with a card no problem  if you want to pick up a gram here or there it s no problem  but i buy in bulk  since it s cheaper that means i need to stop by the bank to get  140 that s the only time i carry that much money on me  it s like requiring a personal check to get a passport no cashier s check  no card wtf it s 2016,7,
65543,are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money,5,
65544,this war on cash is such bullshit  people carried cash until 12 years ago and it was perfectly fine  now they are trying to restrict flying with cash  purchasing with cash  seizing cash   the only problem is that the money is due on one day  they need to have the tax office take payment on any day of the week  so it s stacked,6,
65545,i wonder how negative interest rates  if implemented  would effect the marijuana business these value of the business would probably increase as they had large sums of cash on hand their credit worthiness would increase because they had something of value  cash  but they would be penalized for depositing that cash according to the recent imf working paper i wonder if they would become attractive targets for some banks to help capitalize their weak balance sheets,3,
65546,oh well let you do business  but you just wo nt be able to use any banks what a backwards ass countr,3,
65547,this is a perfect storm for evil doers who seize this unfortunate opportunity all they would have to to do is steak out a caregiver facility i would hope something changes soon this is absurd and the last word of that article  like my post  is penis,3,
65548,they should accept bitcoin problem solved,3,
65549,and you just made it worse by telling people thi,6,
65550,meanwhile   larry summers  it s time to kill the  100 bill   http  wwwbusinessinsidercomsummerstimetokillthe100bill20162  the banking system is corrupt anyhow its time to flush this turd system for something better,5,
65551,sell gift cards  buy them with debitcredit then use the gift card,5,
65552,so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash,4,
65553,bitcoin is the answe,4,
65554,time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins,3,
65555,that  s because it  s cash day at the collection center  when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill  and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot,1,
65556,pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california,1,
65557,its a shame they cant count on the highwayrobber police to guard the money,1,
65558,it looks like they re tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books,1,
65559,this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is,1,
65560,someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy,1,
65561,what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit  checks for those transactions  then just but the trees with the gift certificate,1,
65562,as if the banks do nt take drug money as we speak it is also not like the fbi do nt have cases on going against those banks i really do nt see why there is a problem,1,
65563,can they not employ armored trucks,1,
65564,it s the same way in washington and colorado it s still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed,1,
65565,since the money cant be deposited into a bank would a good option to take be converting it into precious metals such as gold  you would still need to store the gold but that could be easily done in a safety deposit however unless you know where to go  getting that much gold could raise the attention of people you dont want raised to begin with it s not like in china or india  if you show up with a briefcase of cash and walk out with a smaller case of gold  no one really cares,1,
65566,can they print their tax forms using hemp paper  and then turn them into the irs,1,
65567,watch out for that   cop robbery   civil asset forfeiture,1,
65568,so  did anyone else read that article right to the end  the last sentence oof,1,
65569,it would be interesting for all of the companies to announce they were bringing their taxes to the tax office on a particular day let it be known to all criminals in the state i wonder if the state might decide to put some security on the place  then,1,
65570,build your own secure fort no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building,1,
65573,gt  gt  johnson says the man s family will be shown body camera footage of the incident before it s released publicly  well  that s an improvement,6,
65574,personally working as security guard in a hospital  and having to deal with people who have mental health issues its not fun  or safe and generally the actual hospital staff is nt very helpful i ve been kicked in the head  punched in the face  and many other things happen sometimes these people can not be handled and tazeing could deescalate the situation,4,
65575,from what i ve read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops it looks like the taser use was justified sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca nt be deescalated otherwise  has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died,7,
65576,this is unacceptable tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are nt,7,
65577,he died 5 days later at a different hospital  clickbait headline i m sure we ll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death,6,
65578,well at least the officers saved the victim from harming  himself ,4,
65579,he died a week later he was also resisting arrest,3,
65580,officers ca nt subdue people without shocking them to deathstun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only not some wack trying to get mental help,,
65581,oh this is lame  his identity has not been released  nor the race of the officers   wtf does that have to do with anything  oh that s right more race bating by the media,1,
65582,police are to trigger happy they could easily have uses theiroh,1,
65583,the article states he was attacking staff and police using glass vials the police were not obliged to wrestle this violent person and risk getting stabbed by broken glass it s pretty simple  do nt violently attack innocent people and you wo nt be tased,,
65584,police are not there  to protect and serve  you  edit   warren v district of columbia   https  enwikipediaorgwikiwarren_v_district_of_columbia  is just one example that downvoters should read,,
65586,gt   the order is vague and because it imposes disproportionate  intrusive  and punitive measures against households and businesses with   no due process     did nt see that one coming,9,
65587,isps do nt actually want to spy on their customers like that it costs more money to put systems in place to do so and to maintain and operate those systems on top of that  it will only bring them bad press that could piss off customers  cox is basically saying  fuck you i m not taking a significant financial hit to spy on our customers so you can sue them and make money for yourself  they are doing the right thing  and the right thing also happens to be in their best business interest,9,
65588,good guy cox  not selling out their customers  they actually have super reliable internet no outages in any of my apartments so far,9,
65589,so to sum that up we do nt have to worry about any cox blocking,9,
65590,that s nice  but i m still going to run a vpn,8,
65591,all in all i ve been pretty happy with cox as an isp i ve used them in two different cities and it s always been reliable and fast i pay for 300mbps service and always get those speeds  usually higher almost no outages they re putting in 1gbs service in many of their cities right now  including mine  my biggest gripe with them is they have a soft data cap of 2 tb for my tier they do not enforce the caps at all but the fact that they exist means they are probably toying with the idea and there would be nothing to stop them from going evil since they are a monopoly like every other major isp it s like a benevolent dictatorship  http  wwwspeedtestnetmyresult5089441276 that s with a netflix stream going on in another room right now,9,
65592,this must be a new thing many a year s ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did nt even know what that was  none of us knew what that even was and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi,7,
65593,i ve been really happy with cox for an isp both personally and professionally here in okc personally  out of nowhere they bumped my at home connection from 15mbit to 100mbit and my bill  went down  30  all out of nowhere  without me saying a word internet is always up  not throttled  and they have decent support if it s needed  professionally at my job i ran in ip phone deployment with them for our main office  3 satellite offices they were there 100  of the way i have personal names and numbers to call in the event of issues outside of the scope of my support as the companies it admin  and when we ve needed someone on site to climb a pole for instance their longest response time was 45 minutes  i know this sounds like rhailcorporate but the fact is out of all the isps i ve had  comcast  qwest  charter  etc  they ve been the best that s not saying they should nt and could nt be better  but they re angels next to the others  in fact they proactively contact me at work every once and awhile to check on things which i greatly appreciate and they bring us cookies every month yes  our isp brings yes cookies no  we re not a big company 9 employees they re just nice,7,
65594,basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum,8,
65595,i used to work for cox in the field and inside cox did have a department that would monitor massive down loading and uploading but they did away with it shortly after i got there  within a year cox ca nt afford to lose customers right now so it s no surprise they are nt allowing this if they did then they would go out of business from customer loss i survived their huge layoff and realignment,5,
65596,this is nothing new from cox i have had cox internet for over 10 years and worked for them a few years ago they have always had this attitude toward it s customers the customer pays for internet access  cox provides internet access they do nt even enforce data caps  at least in oklahoma   i have received a few emails due to using so much data suggesting that i switch to a business plan to maximize my speed  but have never been charged extra or cut off due to exceeding a data cap,6,
65597,gt  last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers  what the actual fucking fuck,6,
65598,as a customer this is the first good thing i ve ever heard from cox,4,
65599,not true from my experience,3,
65600,i ve had them as an isp for several years and they re excellent i did have one month where i went over my allowed bandwidth limit  300 gb on a 50 mbps down plan   and all i got was an email saying  do nt do that again   no throttling or charges or anything on 100 mbps down plan right now and i usually get 110 at least they re great  come out to me if i m having internet trouble that s not solved by online support  etc pretty good basically  i love cox and i m very satisfied with how much i get,3,
65601,unrelated but i could nt stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox,3,
65602,i am a proud supporter of cox,3,
65603,where are all the penis jokes,3,
65604,not as nice as it sounds if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do nt catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status  eg that they do nt have any liabilityresponsibility for what people use their pipe for   most carriers are  very  vested in not being the internet police,3,
65605,i m guessing that if they had a way to monetize it and add to the bottom line  they d be very supportive,3,
65606,when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battl,5,
65607,cox is actually a familyowned business one of the major interest holders is a 96 year old woman who inherited from her father  she had been running it with her sister until her death in 2007   i happen to think they re one of the leastshady isp and cable providers out there  they also own the travel channel  which is a pretty great channel,4,
65608,i thought this was talking about jesse cox,5,
65609,i work for cox corporate in a startup tech company  and this makes me so happy  btw  they re just as decent an employer as they are an isp compan,3,
65610,cox is spying like a champ  rest assured you have to be quite innocent or high on meth to think they have nt supplied info to big brother and his little brothers  and will not in the future,3,
65611,yells loudly  i will not    whispers  if you need me too,1,
65612,on that headline alone  i thought jessie cox was asked to spy on his youtube subs  was very confused for a little bit,1,
65613,i knew he was my favorite eagl,1,
65614,well that s one bit of good news from cox now if they d stop raising my rates every few months,1,
65615,damn  i wish i had cox i have time warner and i m on my 3rd notice to stop torrenting i do nt know if they ll actually pull the plug  they re charging me out the ass already since they re the only provider in my area,1,
65616,fuck yea cox   comcast   1  co,1,
65617,cox  and to some extent time warner  are cable companies all cable companies fuck you in the ass  these two have the decency to spit on it first i at the very least get what i pay for with both of them,1,
65618,they sent me a few emails in the past  so i got a vpn i will still use it  but good on cox for not being dickbags,1,
65619,they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jone,1,
65620,i had cox for 3 years service was good  and over that 3 years  doubled my download speeds twice no extra cost upload was still garbage  but hey 10015 internet for  65 a month was still pretty killer i have 7575 fios now,1,
65621,almost every single person in my area that has gone to atamp  t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable  they have some shit with them but it s far less shit than others,1,
65622,they re my isp and even though they re the only isp in my city besides att and verizon  they ve been awesome,1,
65623,the shifting of blame to continue  going after johns and endusers has never worked,1,
65624,ho yeah  today is a good day to have cox  teehee,1,
65625,horseshit they cut off our internet because someone was downloading something like a year ago they re the best isp i ve ever used  but they absolutely do exactly what the mpaa et al want,1,
65626,between cox and cable one in both places i live  i actually like our midwest internet providers i feel bad for people getting rammed by twc and comcast we ve paid  45 for 100mbps for several years  which sounds way better than the horror stories i hear from you guys,1,
65627,cause they love internet freedom  or because it costs an extra 30 cents to have an extra indian screen data at the call center for 70 an hour,1,
65628,protected pirate plan from cox   7500month,1,
65631,living in germany and studying  i m gon na pay 300   335   for the upcoming semester  these 335  also includes a public transportation ticket  which is in your student id  that allows me to take the train  bus  tram etc at any time as much as i like in my entire state  books are nt nearly as expensive as in the us  the most expensive book i bought last semester was 80   89    but  seriously  95  of the content for the majority of the courses are uploaded on the university s website  files and documents which you can download for free  also  the university canteen offers you decent food for a fair price  normally around 35   in the end my biggest expenses during my semester are the coffees i buy on campu,9,
65632,i m from the uk and have lived in germany for 6 years now i came here with a 20000 gbp student loan for a 4 year degree in computer science  now i m about to start a masters in web science that will cost me about 1000 eur for the 2 year course  parttime and remote  i m also just about to get german citizenship  most germans are happy to speak english  i have a job here and although most of the company speak english they make i point of speaking german with me  and i with them  i m not very good at german but am slowly learning now after 5 years of being very lazy about learning the language it s a very hard language to learn  screw those articles   but in time you ll get used to it  i absolutely love speaking to locals in german and being understood by them  to me it s like being on another planet and finally being accepted by the local populus  good luck to anyone who wants to come over  it is a wise move  come and see me near koblenz,9,
65633,a friends son went to college in switzerland  we are american  even though he paid additional fees as a non native  and had to travel back and forth to europe  he still paid less than kids who went to local colleges,9,
65634,come gather around the fire and listen to a tale of a spooky and simple explanation of our increasing tuition rates in the us  the government started giving student loans kids take the debt  the schools get the money tuition prices increase because they can rely on the kids to get a gov loan take away student loans  then schools ca nt rely on this money  kids ca nt afford the jacked up tuitions  enrollments drop  schools are forced to cut tuition  now more affordable again it s the same problem with mortgage crisis  just a different industry,9,
65635,it s almost as if germany sees the benefit of having a well educated work force that is not bogged down by insurmountable debt,9,
65636,my college actually sodomizes me,9,
65637,whereas here in the states  they will gladly charge you a  250semester parking fee and you will still not actually be guaranteed a space,8,
65638,maybe i should go to germany,9,
65639,currently living in germany  as an american student on an international internship  what this is nt telling you is that the uni system is significantly different my roommates  all in engineering or other sciences  study all day every day they have a month of exams coming up  and they usually have only one exam per year you fail that  you fail no assignments  projects  etc  just that exam  did i mention this was a fraternity  yeah  they do nt go to uni because everyone does it  like america they work  they get accepted  and they work even more it is nt for partying  it is nt for meeting your spouse or friends  it s for becoming the best you can be  which is how a university should be  good luck to the americans coming here thinking it s anything like the states enjoy the d  ner,9,
65640,something like this gets posted everysingleweek without fail and then a bunch of americans start making hasty decisions to just go study in germany because it s  free   oh and it has been this way for years so it is nt a new thing  the german courses that you will have to take for at least a year to reach fluency are around  300 a month and noduolingo is absolutely not enough to get you to the level you need to study at university  the fees for applications are at  75 then an additional 15  for each university you apply to after the first it can go well into the hundreds  the bank account you have to open for your student visa has to have a frozen amount of at least approx   8500 this is nt to say it is impossible but do nt expect roses and rainbows and raining beer amp  wurst to await your easy university life in germany  also american universities except the few ivy leagues or outstanding schools  baby the absolute shit outta you you can pretty much sail smoothly your first two years while you get your core courses out of the way in germany  you jump right into it in german remember  a different language a crazy  difficult language at that the high school diploma is also not equivalent to the german one that allows you to study at a university the equivalent would be a plethora of ap courses with really good grades or a high school diploma plus two years of college with really good grades and then you re equivalent to a german high school graduate  you will also most likely not be able to transfer credits  german bureaucracy  a bitch you will have to have german knowledge when applying for your visas or someone to be a translator there with you  you may have to do a prep year for certain programs as well it is also very competitive to get into even these programs  i sound like fucking scrooge but i ve been through all of it as so have many people i met along the way  it is possible but it will take a lot of hard work and dedication and time that you wo nt regret  losing  because it may not work out perfectly you may get rejected you may not be accepted for that semester a lot of the popular programs have a cap so it s very restricted in terms of amount of students accepted  do nt expect germany to be a country that is just waiting and fiddling its thumbs for the americans to come and study in their unis for  free  and think that they re gon na make it easy for you it is anything but,9,
65641,my american husband started learning german at the age of 26 a year later he was admitted to vet school here he s almost finished now we ve been paying 120 euros a semester i think he s the only foreign student to not drop out in his class though the drop out rate is high even for germans while he s happy he is debt free  the immense stress of having to learn a very hard subject in a foreign language and a foreign system  bureaucracy is insane here   have caused many panic attacks and one major case of depression and he has nt even started the huge final exam yet but at least we wo nt be  200k in debt when this is over,8,
65642,the fee is actually 150500  per semester books inclusive because of librarys and because we live in 2016 and share digitaly public transport also free  you get 600  per month plus health care  if your parents arent rich  this will be checked by government  as student  and will have to pay back   half of that   in worst conditions after you finished  also  after 3 semesters you must have passed 23 of your finals at any time to get your  baf  g  money  but this will only be checked once no money for extra semesters of course,9,
65643,in my opinion let them come here  let them study here and let them stay here if they want besides the fact that the ones who stay make up for the cost of education it is a great way of cultural exchange  it s always nice to have friends from different countries  so if you are coming to the area of n  rnberg just text me ,8,
65644,currently living in duisburg  germany and studying at the university of duisburgessen   my choice   i grew up in the us  but my parents are from germany after graduating high school it became apparent that studying in germany was an opportunity that i could not pass up i chose my current uni because it has an international studies in engineering program which allows me to pursue a bachelors degree in computer engineering with the first year taught entirely in english   costs   the costs are definitively low the semester fee  including public transport  is below 300   my total living expenses are below 700  a month and that includes health insurance   my experience so far   keep in my mind i m still in my first semester  as others have mentioned before  the majority of students quit after the first year last year  the failure rate of an exam taken by 200 students was over 95   attending lectures is completely voluntary and there is one exam at the end of each course that makes up 100  of your final course grade no homework is given and you are very much on your own forcing yourself to focus and learn everyday can be a serious challenge  feel free to comment or pm with any questions,7,
65645,many american students also come with very false expectations about what german university is like you have to be way more self organised and please do nt expect multiple choice tests,9,
65646,we need to stop this immigration because when america sends its people  it sends unskilled people and we have to spend our money on them we are going to build a wall  get america to pay for it and make germany great again,9,
65647,you can only offer something for free if you limit supply fewer germans go to college than us students   only 30  of germans ages 2534 have completed a tertiary education  which includes academic degrees and some but not all vocational programs that  s below the oecd average  and below the us 45  attainment rate for the same age group  http  wwwlatimescomlocaleducationcommunitylameedufreecollegeeducationingermanybutnotincalifornia20151029htmlstoryhtml edit  so now i am amused that many people are suggesting that fewer people should go to college in the us  presumably other people  not so much themselves they are smart   it seems like this would be a less popular proposal than promising free tuition,9,
65650,it says tourism is still banned there are 12 categories of authorized travel but what are those categories  cargo  family,6,

65678,because america loves her servicemen and women so she wants them to help themselve,8,
65679,i have been calling the helpline everyday for 2 weeks it is a recorded message saying call back later we are busy just then general va helpline,8,
65680,the problem with the va  like most other government agencies  is that there is no accountability when you ca nt fire workers who are lazy  negligent  or worthless  you end up with a disfunctional organization filled with lazy  negligent  and worthless people,7,
65681,yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country,4,
65682,i have a pretty easy solution  why do nt overflow suicide calls just get forwarded to the regular suicide hotline  s   sure its probably better to deal with someone specifically trained to deal with service men and women but anyone is better then a voicemail,5,
65683,that vm box is gon na get overloaded quic,3,
65684,pissing off trained military personnel seems like a dumb idea in the long ru,3,
65685,and sanders wants to make this available for everyone it s not the money that causes this agency to be this way it s the nature of the federal government,3,
65686,it is nt a secret that the va is understaffed that is the biggest issue with the va and if they had more funding for labor costs  they would be in a far better spot,1,
65687,i ve been getting this for over a month the one time i did connect  the estimated wait time was 55 minutes,1,
65688,started up telepsyche again trying to make some progress a pending appointment looms  and i am very much looking forward to it  until she calls me and tells me they re cancelling it  i get a couple of appoints out of them  and then someone is sick  or changes positions there s no way for me to develop a healthy trusting relationship with my therapist  this is not an effective way to heal  so fuck it i ll go till i burn out in a glorious explosion of give a fucks and poop,1,
65689,remember when the va story broke it was really big news and everyone was talking about it and it was front page on reddit  nothing s changed  stories keep coming out about how nothing s changed  but no one cares either because it s not new anymore  or because of politics  or maybe both i do nt know,1,
65690,can anyone explain why the va is so dysfunctional  in short  i do nt get it it seems like they have tons of money but ca nt get their shit together,1,

65706,for those of you incapable of rtfa before making racist comments  the bride and groom are actors hired by a charity to raise awareness and the 37000day statistic refers to child marriages estimated worldwide not specifically in this local area,9,
65707,gt  nearly 15 million girls  some as young as eight or nine so  some as young as eight,9,
65708,37000 child marriages every day  if that s the case why are these people shocked  surely they must see these pedo photoshoots on the reg,8,
65709,these statistics seem unreliable estimated 12 billion new child marriages by 2050  even taking the 37000 a day estimate at face value that would only get you to 500 million by 2050  i mean seriously  assuming population growth rates remain unchanged  unlikely as the rate is slowing significantly  there will only be  47 billion women born under the age of 8 by 2050 is it truly believable that a quarter of women born in the next 34 years are going to be placed into a child marriage,8,
65710,ok this is a serious issue  but fuck the misleading clickbait title,8,
65711,paid to act and still goes for the hoverhand,4,
65712,as young as nine nine years old damn,4,
65713,i doubt half the people even read the article and thought the video was real they were actors and were stopped by plenty of people who called them criminals,6,
65714,i just wanted to point out the hand hove,1,
65715,where in lebanon was this  looks a bit like beirut if so  i can understand the mixed reactions i would wager the reactions would be less mixed in the northern or southern regions,1,
65716,i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country it s picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual some of them just do nt realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do,1,
65717,eh personally i m more concerned with men sitting with their legs spread on public transportation that s the real problem,1,
65718,at that rate the entire female population of the us would be married off in 11 years certainly 37000 child marriages a day is unsustainable or maybe it s media hype,1,
65719,the religion of peaceand pedophiliaand rapeand beheadingsand suicide bombingsand mass executions,,
65720,pakistan tried to pass a law banning child marriages and the clerics said   nope  the koran says as soon as a girl menstruates  she can be dtf whoever she s married to  so you re not allowed to pass a law like that  so they took it back and child marriage continues to be legal,,

65755,this is a great thing people who are bashing him do not make much sense the monuments in dc are one of the united states  greatest treasures  and likewise they cost a lot to maintain let alone refurbish they are a public venue that is traversed by millions and are awesome to each person that visits  this guy decided to use some of his money to give back and better public places that reside in our nation capital and some see him as an asshole  it is one thing to be bitter about not having that kind of money  it is another thing to get pissed when someone with money gives back,7,
65756,its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring,3,
65757,good for him i remember the lincoln memorial being one of my more favorite monuments i d like to take my son there some day  so it s nice to see it will be upgraded and fixed up  to all the naysayers and negative commenters  fuck you,6,

65762,i think it s great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about what i do nt like is that there should nt even be an issue with funding for our monuments,3,
65763,if we re committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i m all for it,1,
65764,i wonder how many huge donations like this  maybe smaller  in the hundreds of thousands  have been made for national monuments pretty awesome someone did this wo reading the article  i have to imagine there s a good amount of rigmarole on the donor s end to ensure the donation goes to where the donor actually wanted govt accountability on any level in the us seems kind of weak lately,1,
65765,all right  a 15000sqft exhibit room underneathkind of like the one in fallout ,1,

65786,colleges really need to stop expelling students due to these kangaroo courts  i m fine with them if it s from breaking a school infraction like alcohol on a dry campus or something of that sort but  if a student is accused of a criminal offense  let the courts deal with it and decide from there  schools are nt equipped to deal with these kinds of cases  nor should they be expected to be these are lifechanging accusations and need to be treated as such  for the benefit of both parties involved,9,
65787,gt  ut investigators later decided  that the evidence supported a finding that  he  had sexually assaulted ms roe  the opposite of the conclusion reached by the more experienced detectives of the police department   the lawsuit says the dean of students then recommended he be expelled  ah but the police are looking for evidence that he did it  college tribunals assume he did and require he provide evidence that he did nt  which  typically  the accused is not allowed to present,9,
65788,gt  one plaintiff is a 24yearold recent graduate  the other is a 21yearold student who is one semester away from graduating with a bachelor  s degree in physics  their lawsuits say   in the graduate  s case  he faces being banned from any ut system campus  being denied a shot at a ut graduate degree and having a notation put on his transcript   the undergrad faces expulsion in addition to the same punishments  that does nt make any sense to me why would an institution retroactively amend the transcript of someone  who already graduated  to say this person violated school policy  after graduating   this seems to be more evidence that they re trying to scapegoat the plaintiffs here i mean  if they were concerned with the alleged victim s wellbeing more than trying to look  tough on sexual assault   what is the point of amending the transcript,9,
65789,who s the idiot who decided that kangaroo courts were a good idea,9,
65790,are we to the point where  sexual assaultrape  almost no longer have a meaning    you getting hammered and hooking up with a hammered guy is not rape  nor is it assault he should sue her for the exact same thing,8,
65791,i once saw a swedish movie called ondskan   evil  that drove me to become a lawyer today  here  https  enwikipediaorgwikievil_  2003_film   plot one of the key issues that caught my attention in this movie is the disregard of the law the school had to the protagonist s rights when he hired a lawyer  because of some grievance he had with the school  it backed off immediatly when the lawyer lay down the letter of the law to the headmaster of that educational institution in front of all his guests  in this university of texas sexual assault case  i believe imhlo  l is for legal   that the constitution sets a foundation of rules for everyone inside it s jurisdiction  and no internal policy that ut may have can go against the rules set by the us constitution everyone should enjoy the right of being innocent until proven guilty  and time and time again people are being layed off their jobs  students expelled  lives ruined because of yettobeproven  accusations  the right thing that any institution  like ut  should always do is address all cases of criminal behavior by always recognizing first the accused innocence until proven guilty in a court of law  edit  grammar,8,
65792,gt  the friend said she thought the woman was conscious because  when she saw her kissing this man  she was awake and talking  the lawsuit says  so intentionally or not the woman who claimed to be assaulted is not telling the truth  editand they decided to expel him without even talking to the student his first chance to give his side was an appeal for his expulsion this is a fucking kangaroo court  edit2  the second lawsuit claims expulsion against a student was recommended without the alleged victim ever personally making a sex assault accusation  http  kxancom20160205lawsuitsagainstutallegebiasagainstmalesinsexassaultcase,9,

65794,gt  university police never spoke to the woman the undergrad was accused of assaulting and no criminal charges were ever pursued  his lawsuit says the father  s report was referred to the ut dean of students  okay what the hell  seriously  though its this sort of thing that makes me really hate schools handling sexual assault cases on their own the police did nt even talk to the accused victim  but decided to tell the dean instead  it feels like it happens all the time when we have these alternate systems of punishment we stop treating crimes like crimes and treat them like rule infractions a rule infraction is cheating on a test an alleged assault is a crime treat it like one,7,
65795,eli5 kangaroo courts thanks,8,
65796,activist administrators  check lack of due process  check prohibited from legal council or cross examination of the accuser  check nothin to see here  move along people,6,
65797,well  they are probably right these school kangaroo courts have demonstrated they have no respect for the privacy and rights of the accused  and are only interested in demonstrating how seriously they take sexual assault accusations,6,

65802,it seems to me that a public institution has to follow the sixth amendment  which grants  the right to a public trial without unnecessary delay  the right to a lawyer  the right to an impartial jury  and the right to know who your accusers are and the nature of the charges and evidence against you,6,
65803,jane roe because jane doe would be incest,4,

65807,gt  the university has been placed under enormous political pressure to appear tough on those accused of sexual assault  there s your problem right there how about be tough on those convicted of sexual assault and those whom the law decides are innocent be treated as such,3,
65808,umso expel the drunken slut too  right  i could get behind that they both got drunk and made bad choices that reflect poorly on the school kick em both out  why only the male  did he conspire in some way to get her drunk  if they re both adults that got drunk and fucked then they re both equally guilty,7,
65809,considering that almost every case of a rape accusation that s come out massively public has been shown to be fraudulent  i m reserving judgement on this one,3,
65810, ut investigates more than 100 allegations of sexual assault a year  and that number is growing  liebman said   how the hell are there hundreds of allegations a year that s insane this reminds me of the play the crucible  i saw you with the devilcommunistscapitalists  homo raptorus,1,

65834,at first i thought this was a reasonable charge  but when i read the article it said that she was actually driving with a flat tire most drunks are smart enough to avoid driving on a flat  this woman is an idiot and deserves a harsh punishment she was intoxicated enough to seriously endanger the lives of others  if an officer had nt pulled her over i m sure she would have caused some serious damage,,
65835,that s cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work releas,,
65836,well it s not like you can prove that she was actually intoxicated  so the fact that she was nt punished seems appropriate,,

65856,bison burgers bison steaks bison roasts  yum,8,
65857,the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison,6,
65858,are they only being killed for food  that s slaughter  if they are being killed for management purposes  that s called culling,6,
65859,it s population control  hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use,6,

65864,i lived 200yds from a burn pit when i was there in 04 i had some skin disease for about 2 years after iraq and some kind of asthma the va did nt give a shit then and they still do nt care  so  i got that goin for me,9,
65865,i was in tikrit  cob speicher  from 08 to 09 i lived a few hundred feet from the  burn pit  it was basically a huge junk yard with 3 huge constantly burning rectangular pits they were about 75 feet long and 50 feet across iirc you could see black or white smoke billowing from the area all the time i had to go there at least once a week to dump trash imagine standing over a red hot fire throwing junk off the back of a flatbed truck while it was 130 degrees outside sometimes the smog was so thick driving through the junk yard  that you could nt see 50 feet in front of you the smoke would almost always linger around the base and it smelled awful olfactory fatigue did not apply here it always smelled no matter how long you d be  exposed  you never got used to it never mind that they burned our shit right next door i remember one day we had to do a pt test the 2 mile run was on the same road as the burn pit smoke everywhere nobody passed that day some people were puking at the end i usually ran a 13  45 2 mile and i remember getting over 17 minutes i was gasping for air at the end we all thought the course was marked out incorrectly  but when we measured it later that day it was exactly 2 miles needless to say  nobody ever had any respiratory protection around these things  ever nor were we ever told we needed them i mean we had our gas masks in our gear  but nobody wanted to be  that guy  damn  we used to joke about it all the time whenever someone would start spewing some  war story   or when some freshoutabasic private would try to tell us about  that one time my drill sergeant made us do this  story   at the end we d say   yeah  but have you ever been to the burn pit    then we d laugh it off i guess it s not so funny anymore,8,
65866,my husband  half  jokes about the cancer he s going to get from the burn pits in afghanistan from what he described  they were horrible,8,
65867,this hits close to home we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight i really need to get this checked out,7,
65868,i can understand why burning trash and human waste may be unavoidable in certain military circumstances like in those remote outposts in afghanistan that might house 1520 people  there really are nt any good alternatives  however it seems less defensible to not have invested in better infrastructure once you had permanent bases the size of small cities  once you re at the point where soldiers had their own little airconditioned houses made out of cargo containers with air conditioning  satellite television  and onbase burger king it seems like you can probably invest in some proper trash incinerators instead of open burn pits,7,
65869,gt  though the us government disputes it well  color me surprised,8,
65870,a tsgt i know died recently from cancer he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family he was 32 his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer,7,
65871, support our troops with a ribbon sticker   that will definitely make up for all the fucked up shit the government puts them through,7,
65872,not surprised saw a guy in the va who used to jog through the base with his unitteam  not sure of the terminology   breathing in the smoke from one of these every day for 4 years he had some chronic lung condition we were working up  and said a couple of his buddies also have lung problems now otherwise perfectly healthy 40 years old  completely unnecessary illness due to stupidity andor apathy,6,
65873,http  wwwpublichealthvagovexposurescamplejeune for decades  the government knowingly allowed service members and their dependents to consume contaminated tap water fifteen diseases are recognized to have a direct relation to the contamination but many more are cropping up yet the government wo nt recognize those  yet   and they re filing motions to have claims tossed out based on statute of limitations  even though the government did nt even announce the contamination until over a decade after the wells were closed  this is nt just an agent orange or iraq war contamination where soldiers were exposed and have problems babies born at the base hospital hadhave an alarmingly high rate of birth defects but nothing is being done about it and the va continues to deny claims we ll just go ahead and add this one to the list,6,
65874,uhh i ve had a severe cough for 34 years now  since coming back from afghanistan  it ll get so bad  that i ll cough until i throw up  and then cough more  the va said it was normal i m sure they know what they re talking about i feel fine,6,
65875,i remember having to sit through a 2 hour briefing the first week i arrived in iraq  back in 2008 we were told that scientists verified that the burn pit on base was not a detriment to our health  then we had to sign forms when i returned stateside  there were quite a few reports of people having respiratory issues after returning from deployment  the va also denied that any illnesses were related to desert storm it took a long time for anyone other than veterans to admit that desert storm syndrome was a real thing  and then said veterans had to go through the gauntlet of proving their illnesses were related to their deployment,6,
65876,goddamn  it s unbelievable the way vets are treated shame,6,
65877,government does nt give a fuck about veterans,6,
65878,my 36yo buddy was just diagnosed with nonhodgkens lymphoma when he visited the va to do the paperwork they asked what bases he served at overseas  and literally had a list of diseases to reference per base just got a  yep  here it is probably from the burn pit  from the clerk thumbing down the list when he told me i was blown away  why is nt there any followup with soldiers who served at these bases    even a simple  you may want to get screened  when he returned from service would have given us some hope of getting in front of it it s incredibly irritating,6,
65879,the us lying about iraq and afghanistan  nah  never happen,7,
65880,do nt worry guys we ll take care of your medical needs when you come home oh wait,5,
65881,do nt forget area 51 they had burn pits like you would nt believe stealth materiels that had top secret components in them the poor guys that were exposed to all of this could nt even go for help  many died in secrecy  i know i was exposed to vaporized depleted uranium and who knows what else i have a sort of bet with my self that i ll die an early death,5,
65882,so  the dod did nt learn any lessons from previous burn pits  i mean  when you have to declassify area 51 because of workers health decline due to burn pits  you d think you d remember this shit is wrong,5,
65883, though he returned home safely in september 2009  he woke up one day a few months later with an inexplicable headache  numbness in his limbs and paralysis on one side of his body beau had suffered a mild stroke his health deteriorated  and he was diagnosed with brain cancer less than two years later  he died at the age of 46  holy fuck    fuck wars and politicians that start them,5,

65888,holy shit  my friend who was on the poop burning detail a bunch of times died of throat cancer earlier this year my first thought was it was the poop burning that did it  and i m concerned as well because i did my fair share of that as well,4,
65889,where we lived there was a burn pit that was nearby and the smoke would always float over to where we were  as of yet i dont have any symptoms but i do have a begine growth in my head  i have had it checked but i am paranoid that it could become bad ,4,
65890,little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did nt have to bother to actually lob chemicalbio weapons at us we d send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chembio bomb themselves  did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney,4,

65932,this is a pretty typical mugging the mugger aggressively asks you a question  and regardless of your answer they either beat you or ask for money sometimes it s shit like  do you care about the homeless   and if you say  yes  then they aggressively ask for money and if you say no they get upset and threaten you and say you are a liar if you say no  they threaten to beat you or they just get violent either way  you are going to end up giving them your walletmoney another common one is asking you for a cigarette if you do nt have any  they will accuse you of having one and not giving it to them because of some stupid reason  racism  greed  etc  and then get aggressive and demand money for a pack of cigarettes whenif you pull out your wallet they will just grab it and walk away or beat you and run  i was on a bus and had a guy ask for my cell phone to make a call  when i said no  he said i was a racist because i assumed he was going to steal it made a big scene and stood up and got in my face and started slapping my head until i gave him the phone then he got off the bus  same principle with this happens all the fucking time if they get caught they usually say shit like  oh he gave it to me  i did nt steal it  scumbags only reason this one made the news is because it was a war vet,9,

65946,i would like to remind everyone that bernie sanders has aligned himself with and defended the black lives matter movement in many of his speeches he talks about sandra bland  michael brown  eric garner and in typical fashion blames racism and the white establishment sanders never once mentions the blacks that are home invading in indianapolis  kansas city  atlanta  etc he never once talks about the blacks that have shot at and killed police  most recently a 19 year old black man shoots an officer in mississippi black lives matter and politicians like sanders are waging that the future will be less white and in that future you folks can imagine who will be the most vile and racist  edit  from today  white house tweets shoutout to grammy winner of best rap album  still no word on recent spate of cop killing,9,
65947,let s see if this gets labeled as the hate crime it very clearly is  who am i kidding  that wo nt happen,8,

65972,yeah if my big illegal bag of money was heavier  i d totally reconsider all the crime i do to obtain large bags of money it just would nt be worth the hassle,7,
65973,thank you but fuck no it s bad enough carrying around 100s to go buy cars amp  bikes on craigslist  now you want me to carry boxes of 20s   the  100 has plenty of legitimate uses  no need to make things harder for the 999  of the population that s lawabiding,9,
65974,thats why they got rid of the  500 billand it didnt work so well,8,
65975,keep marijuana and cocaine illegal  it s the 100 dollar bills that are the problem,7,
65976,i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four  5000 bills instead of two  10000 was too taxing better go straight,8,
65977,clearly  100 bills are the problem,7,
65978,people still listen to larry summers  i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008 or does cnn still think repealing glasssteagall was a good idea,7,
65979,it s not about stopping criminals it s about controlling peoples money with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically this is what done in europe to prevent  tax fraud ,7,
65980,might aswell remove any chemicals or equipment in the world that can make drugs aswell larry summers idea is stupid  it would nt just hurt criminals  it would hurt the innocent people aswell,7,
65981,in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the  100 bill it is very popular outside the us,5,
65982,the new blue  100 bills are too cool to replace,5,
65983,80  of the money supply being in  100 bills is the key statement this would likely be the first  and easiest  step to killing paper currency this is one of the initial hurdles to overcome  because they do nt give a fuck about it being tough on criminals  come on  when looking to implement negative interest rates,8,
65984,the thing about secondary labor markets  drugs  gambling  prostitution  etc  is that prohibition is what causes the main problems related to them these are black markets that will always have demand as long as the activities are forced underground by punitive policy  and that demand will always find a way around obstacles  making life marginally more difficult for the suppliers is only doing to make the products more dangerous  not less desirable,4,
65985,that is the most twisted logic   no more  100 bills  guess i ll stop dealing crack,5,
65986,okay larry last time we listened to you we deregulated the banks in 1999 nah larry  i m not gon na listen to you,5,
65987,make it illegal for poor people to ever have cash money so that you can freeze their accounts when their name shows up on the noflylist  eh  they already ca nt buy a car in cash without the dealership informing on them to the feds,6,
65988,how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds   ,4,
65989,i urge everybody here to watch inside job  it will shock you on how thoroughly corrupt this dude is  along with his buddies on wall street washington now he wants the gov to ban the  100 because of nirp  he does nt give a fuck about criminals using those or tax evasions do not listen to what this turd says,4,
65990,i wonder what larry would think about paul krugman s onetime pet project  the  trilliondollar coin   http  krugmanblogsnytimescom20130107bereadytomintthatcoin  _r  0 ,5,
65991,is something going on with all the major currencies  i saw a similar story about the euro notes too  http  wwwdailymailcoukwiresreutersarticle3448066ecbconsidersscrapping500euronotehtml also http  wwwdailymailcouknewsarticle3437590banksurgedban50notesbidendcashhandculturehelprecoupbillionstaxtreasuryhtml all these stories within a week of each other  i would nt be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency,3,
65992,currently in colorado  hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash,3,
65993,scrap larry summers  and get rid of a criminal,3,
65994,the only relevance to crime is the idea itself scam to grab more control of your money  bankster shenanigans do nt fall for it,3,
65995,the banks love this this means less people holding cash and more money that they can use to fuck us over remember folks  the rules are changing so that the money on deposit with banks is legally not yours if there s a bank failure  your money will be used to bail out the banks  the move is simply an extension of the war on cash,3,
65996,the fed stopped printing any bills higher than  100 in 1945 they began destroying the larger denominations actively in 1969  100 in 1945 is equivalent to  1300 today adjusting for inflation frankly they should be talking about issuing a  200 and  500 bill  if not also a  1000 bill,3,
65997,larry summers should be in prison  he is one of the architects of the 2008 collapse he also was instrumental in the repeal of glasssteagall the world would be better off without this fool and his dangerous ideas  http  wwwsourcewatchorgindexphp  title  larry_summer,3,
65998,does larry mean wall st criminals  of course not  white male entitlement it s what larry is all about unfortunately obama was dumb enough to bring summers into his administration where he flailed about  lamely attempting to cover upmake excuses as to why the theater burned down in 2008 with the financial  masters of the universe  still inside  larry proved his overall dumbness by predicting 2011 would be  recovery summer   based on nothing  no evidence just his  expert  opinion  there was no recovery in 2011,3,
65999,bring back the  500 and  1000 dollar bills dammit,3,
66000,larry summers  ladies and gentlemen one of the masterminds of financial deregulation is now proposing another hair brained idea summers  go clone yourself so you can go fuck yourself,3,
66001,attention  we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash  except pennies   cash is privacy and should be a basic right,1,
66002,just legalize crime everybody wins,4,
66003,fuk this illuminati puppe,3,
66004,the bulk of the value of cash in circulation is from  100 s get rid of cash and the fed can do any crazy policy it wants this is a necessary step towards negative interest rates nobody believes the government gives two shits about money laundering  florida real estate laws and hsbc getting zero criminal charges shows that is not the case,4,
66005,banksters do nt even use cash oh wait you re talking about the little criminals carry on,5,
66006,another attempt by the wealthy to outlaw cash our money is nt our money  according to the elite,5,
66007,then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination ,3,
66008,scrap the two  the single  the penny  half dollar and nickel instead,3,
66009,scrap the drugs too  make them illegal  oh wait,1,
66010,but they just click buttons on a computer and create and move money around  wait  what,1,
66011,than how will our government and cia function,1,
66012,interning theory main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks,1,
66013,singapore has had the 10000 singapore dollar bill for some time it is still legal tender  but is going to be phased out slowly old notes will not be replaced  this is a calculated strategy by the sg government to comply with international counterterrorism and anti money laundering efforts  but minimising their own vulnerability to regulatory arbitrage,1,
66014,is nt the  100 bill the staple of american foreign trade  i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like  interestfree  loans  though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ,1,
66015,politicians do nt use  100s so how could it harm criminals,1,
66016,what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then,1,
66017,gt  the  100 bill is actually the second most common us bill in circulation  behind the  1 bill  gt  nearly 80  of the  14 trillion of us currency in circulation is in  100 bills much of it is held outside the united states  i m no math magician  but this does nt seem to fit,1,
66018,yeah  just watch  they will scrap it right down to the 20  anyone who wants to make largeish purchases will have to use electronic accounts that can be tracked  oh yeah   because crime  not  because government needs to track your every move,1,
66019,this is one of those ideas that seems silly at first but the more you think of it  the more it makes some sense,1,
66020,this is stupid  criminals will make due with what ever currency there is  they do nt fucking care and any one who thinks otherwise is a desk jocky looking for something to do,1,

66023,how would this effect the bitcoin market,1,
66024,this is about getting rid of cash  not making life tougher for criminals that way  when the fed institutes negative interest rates  you the lowly consumer will be forced to spend your savings to avoid being charged for saving,1,
66025,funny thing  today also the eu central bank ceo emanuele prodi announced that 500 euro bills are to be outphased for the same reason apparently american criminals manage to launder money with a bill that s 6 times less in value  is nt this just a global banking scheme to rob us the power over our own money,1,
66026,yes those evil people in government would love to get rid of cash and make everyone just use electronic money because then  the bank has your money and you only have an iou which they may  or may not  pay you back in the future  look at cyprus in 2013 where people did nt get their full deposited funds back because of the financial crisis  also they can charge you negative interest rateswhich means you have to pay for the bank to hold your funds  and of course if the govt has your money  then they have a great deal more power over you in deciding whether they should be nice and give it back to you or not  this is another reason why bitcoin is good  although they will ban that long before they ban cash,1,

66113,clickbait no one around here is remotely upset about taxpayer funds going to a new stadium for the most popular team in town we re not really unhappy about the new development for business and residences that is happening and we re not raising any concerns about the effort to revitalize the city  detroit is climbing out of a hole created by the corruption of influential individuals local business and leaders have been more beneficial in this process than any other group and this stadium  and the district surrounding it are seen as victories in this effort,8,
66114,ah  a local spin on the old  congressperson becomes lobbyist  setup,3,
66115,they are literally building new district for the city not just an arena  a whole new district development is what the city needs and frankly  detroit politics have always been just a  wee  bit corrup,4,
66116,but  guys  come on we need our circuses  what would we do with out national sports  concentrate on real issues  lol  that s no fun ,4,
66117,at ohio state  the man whole negotiated the deal to sell its parking rights to a private company  campusparc  left to work for them after it was signed,4,
66118,you think that s a wig,4,
66119,public money should never be allowed to pay for sports teams unless the team has to pay back the city directly  with interest none of this but businesses will benefit  bullsht it s my fucking money you re stealing  i do nt want to  potentially  subsidize businesses downtown,8,
66120,if you re a bernie supporter  who thinks a public funded  1 trillion dollar infrastructure package is a good deal because jobs  but is outraged by the state of michigan investing  285 million in the renovationrevitalization of its  largest city  then you might want to reexamine one of those positions,6,
66121,for all the people complaining about spending the money on the new stadium and  less mentioned  surrounding developments  all i can say is it will be more than worth it if it fixes up that area governments of all levels have been dumping money into the cass corridor since the early days of johnson s great society programs with any luck this will finally be a solution that stick,7,
66122,itt  out of staters have no fucking idea about the current state of economics in detroit and how great this project is going to be for the city  i do nt even know where to begin with this article it s clear the author did nt talk to a single person in the city or state or even try to get a feel for the public opinion on the topic including garbage clickbait phrases like the previous article titled  detroit scam city  how the red wings took hockeytown for all it had  has to be one of the dumbest fucking things i ve ever read  when detroit was at its absolute rock bottom worst  going to joe louis arena was probably the only reason suburban white people would ever go into the city and spend money now mike ilitch wants to build a gigantic urban development project including restaurants  shopping stores    apartment complexes   and oh yeah a brand new stateoftheart arena for one of the most successful hockey teams of all time  they have nt missed the playoffs since before i was born  25 years ago they are a big deal and have been for decades   oh  and it s being built at the exact time there s an influx of young people and new businesses into the the city which will create more upward momentum  yes  the city is helping pay for it the city also got a lot of input on it design  layout  and what additional projects would be built along with the arena this happens in every single city an arenastadium is built i do nt necessarily think that s how it should work but the fact of the matter is that this is how these deals are made and the city absolutely needs projects like this if it wants to continue on its upward trend  also attacks on mike ilitch in this article and this thread are disgusting illitch has been a controversial figure for a long time but his story is like example of the american dream you d see in fiction his parents were poor immigrants  he grew up in detroit joined the marines played minor league baseball for the team he now owns opens up a mom and pop pizza place and creates an empire out of it  gets rich while creating jobs and doing public works projects for the city he grew up in even though it s a complete shit hole mike ilitch has been spending  and yes  making  money in detroit for years mike ilitch was there in the 90 s and early 00 s before there was ever a housing crash in the rest of the country the man is nt a saint but if it were nt for him there would be a lot less charities and projects being invested in now he wants to build a project the city desperately needs with the city s help and input  and he s getting shit on by some dumb ass  journalist  that ca nt get their facts straight  endran,7,
66123,someone call charlie leduff,5,
66124,good old cronyism at its finest  nothing new to detroit at all,5,

66128,gt  detroit contractor who negotiated  285 million in public money for the red wings now works with red wings owner so  i love how these headlines are supposed to make us feel outraged,4,
66129,same shit happened here in richardson  texas  a suburb of dallas   the mayor brought in a huge company to the city and then left office to get a job with that same company it also turns out she was having an affair with a guy from that company too,3,
66130,stop giving public money let business deal with business  not government  which can only be scammed and lead to corruption and bloated monopolies promote free market  and separation of power,3,
66131,to be fair  he was working with him then too,1,
66132,i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him,1,
66133,conflict of interests everywhere,1,
66134,this is how it worksthere is nt anything new to this story that is nt happening in nearly every major city and state across the country  i do nt like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it,1,
66135,public money  om,1,
66136,wow  you mean so someone who worked very closely with an organization and built relationships decided to work for said company later on in their career  shocking  i tell you,1,
66137,everyone from the owners to the safety and comfort of the city and everyone thinks this whole plan is going to a country that did not mainly speak my language  i would learn it,1,
66138,what a shocking surprise,1,
66139,well that s convenien,1,

66144,gt  purchase orders showing that the sheriff s office spent more than  60000 on barbecue grills wtf why,9,
66145,this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties the docs and comments on the forum board are searing i would imagine many itinformation systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments,8,
66146,i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever,8,
66147,cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification  one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry,5,
66148,they re public officials and public servants  appointedhiredelected we re entitled to see what these records are  without exception,8,
66149,as much as i m for police transparency  i m not for their home addresses being out there that puts their families and neighbors at risk,8,
66150,i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered,8,
66151,anything worth even looking at in this release,3,
66152,do nt know why they re concerned  surely they have nothing to hide ,5,
66153,if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear,1,
66154,good anytime somebody s falsely charged with shit their life is dragged through the mud in the papers  let the pigs have the same,,
66155,you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings,1,
66156,notice that hackers never dox the 01   billionaires sponsoring hillary clinton  etc,1,
66157,you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced  well fuck it no more police and no more rules    fucking stupid juveniles,,
66158,umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops there s hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops,,
66161,has nt he already had  like  two years to prevent this in the first place,8,
66162,lansing has actually dealt with this problem and their civil engineers have a solution which is both fast and more costeffective than traditional measures they connect the end of the new pipe to the old pipes so when they pull out the old pipe they simultaneously thread the new pipes into the existing space this speeds up the process and the people in lansing estimate with adequate training  involving them with the process in flint  and hiring enough crews it can be completed for flint in one year,6,
66163,this whole situation is a national embarrassment  and it makes my blood boil  but what does naacp have to do with city water  is it a race issue as well  i ve never seen the demographics on flint  come to think of it  maybe aspca should get involved  too i bet people are still feeding their pets city water no matter what  edit  i just think it should be about officials   doing their fucking jobs    framing it as a race issue might just come back to bite us  who knows how many towns are discreetly checking for  and finding  elevated lead  should it matter how many african americans live there  if so  how should officials proceed differently  will it result in a process of public relations triage  that prioritizes black communities  public officials just need to do their fucking jobs for the public they serve there s no need to complicate this with race,6,
66164,that s like threatening to get one of those online white house petitions going it does nt matter,4,
66165,fix flint s water pipes or they ll burn flint to the ground,3,
66166,i m all for getting this fixed as quickly as possible but i also do nt want something rushed either figure it out figure it out right,1,
66167,okayand then what  all of the protesting has nt done jack so far what s one more protest going to do  it s not going to make the state government move any faster  it s very clear that the government  at every level  is more concerned about covering itself a protest is nt going to change that,,
66168,sooooo glad i do nt live in flint  that place sounds like a complete disaster,,
66169,who the fuck are they to demand this  are whiteasianlatino people not allowed to be affected by this,,
66171,from  government  s memorandum in support of its motion for pretrial detention   http  wwwscribdcomdoc29947153421616doc4usavclivenbundyusadetentionmemorandumforclivenbundy  gt  bundy is lawless and violent he does not recognize federal courts  claiming they are illegitimate  does not recognize federal law  refuses to obey federal court orders  has already used force and violence against federal law enforcement officers while they were enforcing federal court orders  nearly causing catastrophic loss of life or injury to others he has pledged to do so again in the future to keep federal law enforcement officers from enforcing the law against him as of the date of this hearing  he continues to violate federal court orders and continues to possess the proceeds of his illegal activities  gt  gt  bundy is currently charged with crimes of violence including using and brandishing firearms in connection with crimes of violence under title 18  united states code  section 924  c   as such  the bail reform act presumes that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that will ensure the safety of the community 18 usc  3142  e   3   b   here  no evidence has been adduced during the investigation of the instant charges that even remotely hints at a rebuttal to that presumption in fact  all the evidence suggests that bundy will continue to act lawlessly  will not abide by court orders  and will use violence to ensure that federal laws are not enforced as to him,8,
66172, bundy asked for a courtappointed attorney at his first hearing last week  still living off govt handouts i see,8,
66173,gt  bundy   his  attorney said  would go to court in nevada if ordered to do so   right  sure i mean  it s not like he s ever defied the government before  and he  totally  recognises it s legitimacy  gt  but judge stewart said if bundy was released   i  m guessing that  s the last we  ll ever see of mr bundy  a wise and perspicacious judge,9,
66174, daughterinlaw briana bundy said tuesday that a federal judge in oregon should let the 69yearold live at home while he awaits trial  sure that s an excellent suggestion i would further suggest that the judge prepare a lunch of peanut butter sandwiches with home made raspberry jam and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies for mr bundy each day,8,
66175,gt  the judge said bundy  69  is a flight risk and a danger to the community in the bail hearing tuesday afternoon in downtown portland i mean i ca nt really find a reason not to agree with that a 69 year old who does nt believe he s beholden to the law is as dangerous as a 29 year old who does nt believe he s beholden to the law,8,
66176,they are just misunderstood they did this for free sex toys,8,

66179,the man is a wellmeaning but ideologically obsessed idiot the government has handled this clusterfuck extremely well  and i am not one to say that lightly,6,
66180,it s important for the government to provide a consistent and cohesive narrative if they are to help squash future acts of rebellion cliven bundy and his ilk are lawless  violent  redneck anarchists and none of the things they protested had any validity whatsoever,1,
66181,good  this arrest and trial has been delayed for too long,7,

66191,i do believe they are nt understanding that the phone ca nt be decrypted by apple or anyone,7,
66192,even if they wrote a program to stop the wait time or not wipe phone after a certain amount of failed attempts  you would still need to get inside the phone to implement it,3,
66193,this is what the fbi was looking for  the one terrorist case it can trumpet to prove it needs to unlock anyone s phone at any time,1,
66194,why not just dump the phones firmware and then brute force it there  learn2nsa fb,1,
66195,under what law or authority can a third party company be compelled to take some action  other than testifying  in a criminal case  can the feds order a construction company to build a house  can they order a car manufacturer to build a custom version of a car,1,

66204,because america loves her servicemen and women so she wants them to help themselve,8,
66205,i have been calling the helpline everyday for 2 weeks it is a recorded message saying call back later we are busy just then general va helpline,8,
66206,the problem with the va  like most other government agencies  is that there is no accountability when you ca nt fire workers who are lazy  negligent  or worthless  you end up with a disfunctional organization filled with lazy  negligent  and worthless people,7,
66207,yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country,4,
66208,i have a pretty easy solution  why do nt overflow suicide calls just get forwarded to the regular suicide hotline  s   sure its probably better to deal with someone specifically trained to deal with service men and women but anyone is better then a voicemail,5,
66209,that vm box is gon na get overloaded quic,3,
66210,pissing off trained military personnel seems like a dumb idea in the long ru,3,
66211,and sanders wants to make this available for everyone it s not the money that causes this agency to be this way it s the nature of the federal government,3,
66212,it is nt a secret that the va is understaffed that is the biggest issue with the va and if they had more funding for labor costs  they would be in a far better spot,1,

66215,remember when the va story broke it was really big news and everyone was talking about it and it was front page on reddit  nothing s changed  stories keep coming out about how nothing s changed  but no one cares either because it s not new anymore  or because of politics  or maybe both i do nt know,1,

66248,does this mean that harry reid s son s land deal can finally go through,,
66250,that article is really light on details  does anyone know why this happened  did the guy not respond to a court summons or something along those lines  is nt a default the judgement the usual result in that situation,9,
66251,this happened in feb  2003 in minnesota as well  article   http  wwwmndailycom20030214usmarshalsarreststudentloandebtorstwincities,9,
66252,what happens if you literally ca nt pay your loans  asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11  just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job  edit  something a lot of you do nt seem to realize is that these were private loans there s no forgiveness with those,9,
66253,not really too much context given here  so it s hard to guess at the actual situation  but federal student loans  at least direct loans and the majority of those older loans passed back to fsa as they phased out the guarantee programs  do nt get sold to private collection agencies at this time maybe that part happened a while back  before current policies went into place and the collectors are taking advantage of the protections that federallyoriginated loans have  anyway  for people who are interested in learning more about how defaulted federal student loans are being collected today   check this out   https  wwwfbogovindex  s  opportunityamp  mode  formamp  id  216a8418f8e71f0c9c3475946ab100f8amp  tab  coreamp  _cview  1  they re currently in the middle of contracting new private collection agencies to service defaulted loans and you can see in the rfp documents how agencies are being scored and how that ties into account assignments  basically  for those who do nt feel like running through all of it  the big emphasis for student loan collections now is getting people through affordable rehabilitation options and into incomedriven repayment plans placements look like they re going to be based about 50  on careful regulatory compliance and borrower satisfaction surveys  which would make it extremely difficult for high pressure collections tactics to work out in the long run  none of that changes this story  just thought it was interesting in light of some of the comments i ve read that indicate people believe strongarm collection tactics for student loans will always be the norm  tldr  they re at least trying to throw a friendly paint job over the horribly broken federal student loan system these days,9,
66254,if you dont show up to court after you have been served this is what happens he has been ignoring collection attempts  he got served and ignored that too im not in favor of this man being arrested but you cant ignore court summons if you get served you have to go,9,
66255,upconwell said it best  gt  you are reading way to much into the article no one said they were violent no one said they had their guns drawn they are us marshals  they carry guns  every god damn day   gt  they probably went to his door  knocked he answered and they said  hey  we have a warrant for you for failing to appear in a federal court   he probably said  oh shit let me get some pants  gt  no violence  no guns drawn  everything was pretty standard and nonviolent  gt  plus  it should be noted that he was not arrested for failing to pay student loans  he was arrested for violating a court order,9,
66256,how do you not pay a  1500 loan after 30 friggin years,9,
66257,gt  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  this almost reads like satire,9,
66258,i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors,9,
66259,where in this article did it say  guns drawn  as most people are stating here  it says  with guns   every on duty us marshal goes through their day  with guns   someone signed a contract for a loan  and then spends almost three decades not paying it i agree that a police force should nt have been used there are financial measures that can be taken upon default of a loan rather than criminal  but i m really surprised by the circle jerk that s happening over a fox news article,9,
66260,can i get a misleading title please,8,
66261,you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day,6,
66262,lol  you guys are so gullible the guy dodged this debt and refused to engage the proper authorities for 25 years this is nt a new college graduate that missed one payment then you have the cascade of predictable posts stating  boot lickers    debtors prison  and how in 30 years this will be the watershed moment we all look back to as we are enslaved by the government this is a statement case the feds took an extreme example and made an extreme example of this putz the goal of this action is compliance and to get folks to not ignore their obligations the money spent on this will scare the other million folks that are past due to actually pick up the phone and engage them to resolve the debt no one held a gun to this guy s head to sign up for the student loans and no one was stopping him for 25 years from making a payment plan for the remaining  1500 this guy deserved it and as a tax payer this is ok by me,9,
66263,real story here dude was sued by the united state of america  he refused to appear  a default judgment was issued against him  he refused to appear for postjudgment depositions  judge issued an order directing him to appear in court  he ignored it and then the judge issued an arrest warrantincareration order and federal judges use us marshalls to enforce their orders  so he was nt arrested for having old student loans he was arrested for refusing to comply with a direct order from the judge  http  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386htm,8,
66264,that dude could not come up with  1500 in 29 years,8,
66265, a few years ago congress allowed the private sector to contract for student loan collections and so you have these private companies who are doing this  i find this scary  even though i have no student loans to pay off they dragged this dude to court and made him sign an agreement in front of their private attorney he had no attorney present  and was nt read any rights  edit  quote is from the video,9,
66266,forever grateful i graduated with minimal student loans ca nt ignore bills for 25 years though  regardless of what those payments stem from from reading through the comments here  it seems like incomebased payment option is the smartest option,5,
66267,i wish my student loan balance was  1500,6,
66268,i knew this story was light on facts turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies  source   yahoo finance   https  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386html,5,
66269,gt  our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is nt the first and wo nt be the last  this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least,8,
66270,he was nt arrested for not paying his loan  he was arrested for not showing up in court  and the marshals did nt storm his house guns blazing they had guns  with them   like every other cop in the entire country,7,
66271,if you take money and have no plans on paying it back  it s called stealing,9,
66272,right the debt collectors just bought the debt  payed the filing fees to bring the case to court  threatened the man with their now official   pay us or else  and when he did not they used their settlement to have him arrested by the marshals nope  no government officers for hire here  just good old debt collection paid and serviced through the courts,5,
66273,til that most people have no understanding how the court system works  yes  civil attorneys can issue subpoenas  yes  a court can hold you in contempt if you fail to appear yes  a potential punishment for contempt is a bench warrant for your arrest  tl  dr  you can not simply ignore subpoenas you may go to jail,5,
66274,writing and publishing articles like this is dangerous the author offered a sensationalist angle on the  story  while leaving out key elements of why they were there in the first place ie missing court summons this is highly unethical and paints the federal government into a larger narrative that fox has been going for basically  rallying people by emotion not logic,6,
66275,this just in  there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government film at 1,5,
66276,student loans were made with certain assumptions about the future of the economy  both on the part of the schools  the tuition they charge   the lenders  and the student people should be required to pay their student loans but they should be adjusted downward  edit  this guy had a loan for  1500 measly bucks and did nt make any payments in 30 years  i would like to know if he was destitute  or just decided  fuck you everyone  i want to keep my money ,8,
66277,misleading title the marshals service will  arrest  you if you fail to show up for a court appearance you are not being tossed in jail  you are being hauled into court when you refused to answer a summons  from the article   paul aker says he was arrested at his home last week for a  1500 federal student loan he received in 1987  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  does anyone feel sorry for this man   1500  be serious,7,
66278,if i did nt pay back a federal loan for 29 years  i d kind of expect for there to be negative effects this dude did nt pay his loan  including when he was taken to court over it and received a judgment from the court specifically telling him to pay it if you ignore a court order  you re gon na have a bad time  i mean yes  the financial aid system needs to be fixed  but they re going after people who purposely are nt paying their loans which is a surprising amount of people  given how many refund chasers there are in the world for anyone else  there are programs like deferment options  sliding payscales  and whatever else along with loan forgiveness after 20 years  it s a shitty system  but this guy s case is not going to be the one to change it because he does nt deserve to have people dying on his hill for his particular cause,8,
66279,i m socialist and firmly believe that education and medical care should be paid for by federal government out of contributions that we make  however with that said  if you are contributing member of society you have to be a special kind of asshole not to repay  1500 loan over the period of 29 years no matter what was that loan used for,8,
66280,why is this news,5,
66281,dude got letters in his mail for months to pay and appear in court  this doesnt just come out of the blue he refused to show up to court multiple times thats a criminal offense,5,
66282,the revolution will not be subsidize,5,
66283,the whole student loan thing is a complete disaste,4,

66285,just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to the paper really is nt worth it otherwise college is becoming a joke anyways,5,
66286,every interaction i have ever had with navient  they have done everything they can to work with me  is your payment affordable  would you like a deferment  etc  i have had to take them up on that because of divorce not saying that is everyone s experience but they have nt been the loan sharks everyone else seems to act like they are just one man s experience though,5,

66296,it s fun that the government has turned the words freedom and patriot in to code words for tyrannical  and selfish,1,
66297,okay  i m not american  but did nt the senate legalise homosexual marriage  so is nt this unconstitutional,1,
66298,allowing people to do what they want with their own property is nt antigay  it s profreedom and proequality the right to follow your on conscience is as fundamental as the right to follow your own gender identity equality under the law is as far as laws should go,1,
66299,i have 2 problems with this a  fair and equal treatment isnt a right hate to say it  but people are assholes would i refuse to serve someone based on some character trait  no is it still my right to refuse to serve anyone i dont like  assuming that it s my buisiness   you bet your ass it is it s not a smart buisiness plan  but the law doesnt require that i be smart b  how the fuck would someone know that youre gay  i mean  sure some people might fit every single stereotype  but that doesnt mean that they are gay unless they specifically ask  are you gay  and you reply  yes  i am homosexual   which again  is not required by law   how would they be able to destinguish your sexuality  this whole bill is just too messy for my likin,,

66318, every  prepackaged shredded cheese has it it s the most common anticlumping agent used around the world the argument is that the labels said 100  cheese,9,
66319,labels should be accurate end of story if the product inside does not match the label ingredients  it is fraud and should be prosecuted as such,8,
66320,that s why you buy a little wedge of parm and use a microplane grater on it to shave cheese onto your pasta the wedge lasts a very long time  and in the end it s cheaper than the nasty jars,7,
66321,cellulose is the actual substance you ll find it in all pregrated cheeses these guys were just busted putting too much in to save    lettuce is also made of cellulose where commercial outfits get it for cheese  i guess could be just about any plant judged edible  including  sure  trees  also who knows what kind of cheese you re supposedly getting much nicer to get a hunk of the real stuff and a crank grater  my knuckles hate box graters with a passion ,8,
66322,so my penne has wood,8,
66323,so the correct labeling is 92  cheese and 8  wood filler  i think that s right,6,
66324,solution  buy your parmesan  domestic or real  and grate it yourself tastes better too if you re really lazy  grate it and freeze until you need it,7,
66325,damn were becoming like china  next will have faked food,5,
66326,what kind of wood   are we talking the high quality organic stuff  or factory processed scrap wood  because goddamnit if they ve been slipping cheap wood shavings into my welfarecheese  we re going to have an fucking issue on our hands,4,
66327,lol  wood it is cellulose trying to get clicks,6,
66328,i m safe  source  only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti,3,
66329,i shred my own parmesan cheese  it makes worlds differenc,3,
66330,this is why i do nt buy nasty sargento cheese ever taste it  it tastes like wood  i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better,3,
66331,hmm i am pretty sure i misread that title,1,
66332,it s cheaper by the chunk anyways,1,
66333,similar to olive oil  most parmesan cheese is nt even parmesan cheese,1,
66334,my parents always called it cardboard chees,1,
66335,it still taste oh so goooooooood,1,
66336,if it tastes good  i do nt care,1,
66337,pene means weiner in spanish that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood,1,
66338,maybe they are just trying to get people to eat a whole door over the course of a year,1,
66339,just buy the blockwedge and grate your own,1,
66340,gt  she faces up to a year in prison  so  what re you in for blondie    just beat me up and get it over with,1,
66341,cellulose is indeed an anti clumping agent if they use more and it does not change taste  i am ok with it at least it has less calories  ,,
66342,if you buy preshredded or grated cheese  you deserve to eat wood,,
66344,interesting though   since 2005  texas has prosecuted 38 juveniles for intoxication manslaughter or intoxication assault only three were sent to the adult system  and half of all cases resulted in probation of some kind  i think this is more telling of the justice system  and accessibility to competent  quality counsel it s clear money buys better legal counsel  but if the government subsidized public defense more heavily  the outcomes would clearly be different,9,
66345,cash is king in the world of corruption,9,
66346,i said this somwhere else  but it s also pertinent here  everyone is equal under the law and money is how we measure that equality,9,
66347,the difference  money,9,
66348,it s almost like the rich live under different rules,8,
66349,this is standard practice in the us judicial system outcomes will vary from case to case depending on financial status there s actually a legal term for it  it s called   cream ,9,
66350,my mom has always said guilty until proven rich,8,
66351,i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law this is the american dream,7,
66352,and liberty and justice for all  who can afford it ,5,
66353,i love how this article just glosses over the fact that arellano had previous dui convictions which is why he did nt receive the same sentence  this was couch s first dui case which is why he got probation  as texas takes the rehab route  but whatever lets rage and ignore the fact,8,
66354,is everyone here honestly  seriously shocked that money gets you out of trouble  am i taking crazy pills,5,
66355,going beyond the dae legal system is corrupt  circlejerk in this thread  there are certainly some differences in these cases firstly  the arellano case  the other one in the article  happened in 2007  six years before couch s trial likewise  the article says that arellano had driven while intoxicated and drank underage before  which means that he would ve had a greater chance of being moved to an adult trial meanwhile  couch had no prior violations of the law  meaning that he could nt be moved to an adult court,7,
66356,i understand what you are trying to do with your anecdotal case comparisons however  they are nt comparable cases when you consider all the factors  including criminal history  but  even if you ignore all the other factors  i know of a white 20 yo male from a fairly wealthy family in my area who was sent to prison for a year based on a drunk driving accident so my anecdotal evidence shows similar punishment to your anecdotal case thereby anecdotally refuting your point,8,
66357,the real crime here those eyebrow,6,
66358,gee  it s almost like different judges and prosecutors in different areas with separate cases can lead to different verdicts or something,7,
66359,that s why the case became famous because he got away while guilty that was autocorrect capitalization,4,
66360,affluenza is just a fake term that means the following  if you are rich  you do nt go to jail if you are not  you will spend 10 years like 95  of americans,4,
66361,let s be clear what happened to the poor kid was what s supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone you fucking go to prison couch was the exception,7,
66362,he did nt go free he was on probation and then he violated that  so he s going to jail,8,
66363,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,3,
66364,if someone is brought up too rich to not know the difference between right and wrong  why can the same argument not be used for poor people who commit crimes  people who are brought up in poverty do nt really know right from wrong just as much as a kid who has rich parents,3,
66365,that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time,3,
66366,  sees title   probably not a rich white kid   clicks article   and yuuuuuuuuuup sm,3,
66367,prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win,3,
66368,obviously as white god intended,3,
66369,i fucking hate ethan couch  i mean look at that look on his face disgusting i mean even his name is stupid,6,
66370,horrible headline  38 cases of dui manslaughter in texas since 2005 and only 3 of them went to adult court  that tells you the vast majority of these cases are handled with kid glovesso picking out one of 3 that went the other route and comparing it to the affluenza case is disingenuous  but fuck it  that is what the media does today god forbid they instead do an article focusing on how in texas if you are a drunk driving kid that kills people you will get away with it 35 out of 38 time,4,
66371,it did nt seem to mention how they had the same judge  we ve already established this same judge would have been open to giving a similar sentence to a poor minority because she tried to do just that keep making this a race issue  though lord knows the media loves to stir up ignorant poor folks  also  anyone who comes to the us illegally and kills is citizens deserves little sympathy he was a juvenile  so it would be appropriate to release him and deport him  i do nt understand the need to distort issues to make tbem about race we already have enough problems it s already an established fact that those with the means to afford a lawyer fair better than those who do nt,3,
66372,the difference  money,1,
66373,did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window,1,
66374,by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time,1,
66375,excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did,1,
66376,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,1,
66377,lemmeguess ethnic  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they re ethnic,1,
66378,cash rules everything around me they have  and very good lawyers,1,
66379,well  on one hand you have a kid that killed 3 adults and a child in a crash  and on the other a kid who killed a mother and her  unborn child  in a crash in a conservative state so he could have mowed down 10 born people and probably got less than what he gets for  accidentally  killing 1 unborn baby,1,
66380,free public defender vs 2000  an hour lawyer,1,
66381,this affluenza thing still baffles me  doing bad things because money  with that sort of logic hobos must be saints and not the crack heads living under bridges,1,
66382,no shit  i mean was nt the entire outrage that similar cases normally lead to prison in the first place,1,
66383,seriously  the rich kid,1,
66384,that s what  affluenza  means literally the entire point of this case and why it s been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich,1,
66385,i say it like my grandma used to  money talks  bullshit walks,1,
66386,he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows wtf,1,

66417,can someone eli5 me why we even need fracked oil right now when prices are projected to keep dropping,1,
66419,this makes sense a lot of people in science fields relating to cancer formation  such as radiology and medicinal biology  are of the opinion that most cancerous tumors are actually quietly killed by the body before they can reach critical mass to defend themselves  and the ones that prove dangerous are the ones that either do nt register to t cells or which grow too quickly to be snuffed to simplify  the reasons for this are simple  not everyone dies from cancer  and everyone gets exposed to carcinogens given the rate of mutation  the influence of radiation  the amount of background radiation  etc  that everyone is unavoidably exposed to  we should all develop tumors if there is a true casual relationship if you simply say that the body is helpless against them naturally  we would all die from cancer the body  must  be defending itself from them given that we do nt  in fact  it s basically accepted as scientific truth cancer is nt simply the presence of cancerous tumors  it s the presence of cancerous tumors that have the right surrounding cells  in the right quantity  that do nt die from immune system intervention and which have favorable growth conditions most small tumors simply do nt have the right conditions  and die studies have confirmed that the ones that register as cancer are a subset of all tumors that might form  because this subset avoids the usual limiting factors  so  going back to the article  this is simply taking the bodies natural process for fighting tumors and guiding it to specific cancers it might normally miss and saying  go get it   then praying you did nt just kill the poor sap with his now manically overenthusiastic immune system,6,
66420,gt  the treatment involves removing the tcells from patients  tagging them with  receptor  molecules that target cancer  and putting them back into the body in an infusionthe targeting molecules  known as chimeric antigen receptors or cars  came from specially bred genetically engineered mice   gt  in one study  94 percent of participants suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia  all  said their symptoms vanished completely after they were treated with the modified blood cells  known as tcells  it looks like this could be a very  very big deal i m surprised that  as of this comment  this post is not getting much attention,7,

66437,i m fully expecting to get downvoted to hell here  but what the heck  i m not particularly fond of comcast  but unless i missed something here  which is entirely possible   this does nt actually sound like it was particularly horrific for people in general it sounds like a very small fraction of their nationwide customer base  had an outage of parts of their service for about 3 or 4 hours  not even all of their service  but things like they could nt access their hd channels  or their internet did nt work for a few hours  i understand for businesses  an internet outage can be a big deal  so some outrage on their part would be justified  but for the general consumer  come on  get a grip go read a book for a while  or go outside for a bit  or  gasp  go do something with your family  i m just not getting what the huge deal was here  what am i missing,7,

66441,comcast angers me even without outages,7,
66442,the words  anger  and  comcast  come up often,4,
66443,there needs to be legally mandated uptime and speed requirements  95  of the time your connection must reach the  advertised  speed  no more  up to xmbps  allowed  and 99  of the time it must reach 14 of that speed if this is nt met then customers must be completely refunded for that month,4,
66444,is anyone else still completely fucking down  just everything  been down for 15 hours here,4,
66445,quote from the article   comcast has more than 27 million customers  and 89000 of those are new cable subscribers the company signed on last quarter that was its best performance in eight years  correct me if i m wrong but are nt there 2 choices for most people  sign up with comcast or do nt have high speed internet  it s like bragging because people choose to eat food from the only supplier rather than starve to death,4,
66446,comcast seems to be an isp that people love to hate  charter got so bad for so many years that i loved to hate them in all honesty  the past three to four years or so they have been great,7,
66447,customer service replied   working as intended,3,
66448,i ve had comcast xfinity for almost 2 years now and i ve never had an issue,5,
66449,fun story i was at a friend s place watching the superbowl in denver comcast blacked out cbs with 1 minute 26 seconds left on the clock in second quarter  and service was nt restored till about 15 seconds before 3rd quarter kicked off  idk how widespread this was but lots of denverites did nt get to see the super bowl halftime show i d imagine comcast would lose a lot of money if their advertisers paid to have a certain amount of views and one of the biggest markets  since denver was participating in the super bowl  cut out all views during the entire halftime show idk how their whole contract with that stuff goes though  i hear i did nt miss much though,4,
66450,that s what happens things go out sometimes,3,
66451,friend of mine called to ask why he couldnt connect  he obviously cant check if there are outages in his neighborhood without the internet  he calls them and they offer to send a tech to his house for like  80  they didnt tell him the price  but you know itd be up there  he spends an hour checking all his connections  digging through paperwork to find his modem settings page  finally calls back about 8hrs later hoping to talk to someone else and theyre like   oh yeah  there s an outage in your area   idiots,4,
66452,when i called  i was disconnected 3 times this is great customer nonservice beside the lack of tv thanks comcast for helping me make my change from you  easier,1,
66453,it s nothing new that comcast absolutely sucks,1,
66454,when you deal with technology  there is only one thing i can guarantee you it will get down at the worst possible time,1,
66455, compact angers thousands across the us for something other than just being comcast for once  ftf,1,
66456,they just put a data cap on my home internet how fucked is that  pretty fucked if you ask me,1,
66457,what is the most troubling about comcast is that when there is an outtage  it doesnt effect just a small region  but instead downs multiple states that seems so rediculous,1,
66458,once they fix the outage you re left with  comcast anger thousands across us,1,
66459,now only 1000 years to lrrr ruler of the planet omicron persei 8 comes to destroy earth,1,
66460,it s not like we re losing  that  much more bandwidth it s only like 20 megs less than what we had before which was only 80 megs less than what we re paying for,1,
66461,so  i had to get comcast recently because i moved and noticed something weird about my bill the letter in the mail has a different due date than the due date that shows up on the online account just saying folks make sure to pay 2 days before your date at least,1,
66462,just having comcast in general makes them angry,1,
66463, nsfw how comcast really feels   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  kmcny_pixdw,1,
66464,once in a while fios is out for a few hours hard to get too pissed  these things do happen i do nt think comcast needs an outage to be hated honestly though for me they were a decent provider  i never had a single issue with them except for the occasional outage,1,
66465,wow now that s comcastic,1,
66466,it was out for like 3 hours jesus christ,1,
66467,my comcast service  for the first time in years  has actually been pretty good lately but i d like to pay less  so i m rooting for google fiber to come to boston simply so i can reap the benefits of competition  i mean  that s what we really want  right  we do nt want yet another monopoly  no matter how  altruistic  we think google will be  we want the existing monopolies to be forced into providing quality service for a reasonable price  along with other choices,1,
66468,it probably still worked better than my centurylink ds,1,
66469,comcast s response   it pays the restoration fee  or else it gets the hose again,1,
66470,my case  as in many others  boils down to this  you can pay triple the amount for the same throughput speeds or you can curse comcast and wait for google fiber,1,
66471,at the same time  i would nt want to be on the other end and get screamed at from 10k  people experiencing the outage i just went out instead of being at home it s aggregating that it happens so often  at the same time there are other things to d,1,
66472,they should just switch providers if they are nt satisfied  see what i did there ,1,
66473,after this comcast will just be turning off their services everywhere after all  they could save a ton of money that way,1,
66474,for comcast  it was tuesday,1,
66475,spread your cheeks  most of you wo nt even complain or ask for a billing credit,1,
66476,title should just be  comcast angers thousands across us   i fucking hate comcast with every fiber of my being  reasons  i  paying top dollar for slow as shit internet  ii  a modemrouter combo that broadcasts an unsecured public network from your home which has to be manually deactivated  iib  said modem has to be forced reset once a week  and doing so undoes the manual changes you made to get rid of the second network  iii  arbitrary data caps  iv  live television that freezes  v  ondemand that works infrequently  and turns into minecraft porn when it crashes  vi  customer  service  that refuses to listen to what your problem is  but instead tries to upsell you on a more advanced package  one of my dreams is to live long enough to see this shit stain regional monoploy of a company implode upon itself  or be run straight into the fucking grave by google fiber,1,

66482,let the  14 dollar beer flow,8,
66483,corruption of public officials in michigan  no way,9,
66484,i certainly do nt necessarily agree with public funds being used for a sports stadium  and i definitely do nt agree with nepotism  but i think criticizing mike illitch somehow taking advantage of detroit is a shortsighted mistake had it not been for mr illitch pretty much singlehandily reinvesting in a city everyone wanted to leave behind over the last 20 years  the city would nt even be close to back on a path to relevancy  whether you want to believe it is or not   the other thing to consider is that this new complex not only brings commerce to an area that was a combination of blight and open fields  it also brings quite a few jobs to the city  as well as some stateoftheart buildings that will bring commerce and international travelers to the area for a variety of reasons  conferences  concerts  etc   this all equals more money for the city of detroit  which is why they re willing to make the investment in the first place   and another part of a blightfilled neighborhood updated and usable for the future  this is a sticky situation that reeks of an unfortunate quidproquo  but when it comes to what is good for the city of detroit  it s hard to argue that anyone has anything on the passion and dedication of mike illitch,9,
66485,how in the fuck are there no comments about the red wings owner s hair  ,9,
66486,everyone talks about the insanity in pro sports these days  yet no one mentions  public or private  universities  which are all nonprofit  spending massive amounts of their cash on stadiums  athletic facilities  etc it s the same thing if the universities are public  and its only marginally different if they re private the reason they have that money in the first place is federallysubsidized student loans,8,
66487,lol illitch has done more for the city of detroit than any other person in the last 50 years fuck off,9,
66488,so he did a good job for the team and the owner offered him more money for a better job  happens all the time  kids,6,
66489,is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit  or ford field  most people would not step foot downtown if it was nt for those two places i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do nt bring forth revitalization like intendedbut the only article i ve read was about stadiums in la and sf,6,
66490,before you jump on the  why ca nt detroit use the money for things that actually matter  train   here s   http  wwwcrainsdetroitcomarticle20140921news309219990oncostfinancingofwingsarenahereareanswers  an article outlining the finances of this massive project  edit  s  for those not wanting to click  gt  the initial base price is  450 million problems  changes and added amenities could increase that final cost anything beyond  450 million must be paid by the ilitches  gt  the michigan strategic fund will sell  450 million in two series of bonds they will be divided into  250 million in series a bonds that will be backed by property taxes already captured by the downtown development authority the  200 million in series b bonds will be backed by the  115 million olympia development has agreed to pay the dda for bond retirement  gt  the ilitches  through olympia  will pay  200 million of the bond debt detroit s dda  via its property tax capture ability  will pay back  250 million of the bonds new yorkbased merrill lynch  a division of bank of america  which has pledged to buy all the publicly backed series a bonds in the deal it will then sell the bonds to the public dallasbased comerica bank inc will buy the series b bonds backed by olympia s money the bank  formerly based in detroit  has the naming rights to comerica park  where the ilitchowned detroit tigers play comerica intends to keep the bonds on its books rather then sell them,8,
66491, misleading title   https  wwwredditcomrhockeycomments45xs0mdetroit_contractor_who_negotiated_285_million_ind00vnke   it was state money  not detroit s also  ilitch footed most of the bill himself  or through his company   please research  the district  and see their plans for it before passing judgement,9,
66492,clickbait no one around here is remotely upset about taxpayer funds going to a new stadium for the most popular team in town we re not really unhappy about the new development for business and residences that is happening and we re not raising any concerns about the effort to revitalize the city  detroit is climbing out of a hole created by the corruption of influential individuals local business and leaders have been more beneficial in this process than any other group and this stadium  and the district surrounding it are seen as victories in this effort,8,
66493,ah  a local spin on the old  congressperson becomes lobbyist  setup,3,
66494,they are literally building new district for the city not just an arena  a whole new district development is what the city needs and frankly  detroit politics have always been just a  wee  bit corrup,4,
66495,but  guys  come on we need our circuses  what would we do with out national sports  concentrate on real issues  lol  that s no fun ,4,
66496,at ohio state  the man whole negotiated the deal to sell its parking rights to a private company  campusparc  left to work for them after it was signed,4,
66497,you think that s a wig,4,
66498,public money should never be allowed to pay for sports teams unless the team has to pay back the city directly  with interest none of this but businesses will benefit  bullsht it s my fucking money you re stealing  i do nt want to  potentially  subsidize businesses downtown,8,
66499,if you re a bernie supporter  who thinks a public funded  1 trillion dollar infrastructure package is a good deal because jobs  but is outraged by the state of michigan investing  285 million in the renovationrevitalization of its  largest city  then you might want to reexamine one of those positions,6,
66500,for all the people complaining about spending the money on the new stadium and  less mentioned  surrounding developments  all i can say is it will be more than worth it if it fixes up that area governments of all levels have been dumping money into the cass corridor since the early days of johnson s great society programs with any luck this will finally be a solution that stick,7,
66501,itt  out of staters have no fucking idea about the current state of economics in detroit and how great this project is going to be for the city  i do nt even know where to begin with this article it s clear the author did nt talk to a single person in the city or state or even try to get a feel for the public opinion on the topic including garbage clickbait phrases like the previous article titled  detroit scam city  how the red wings took hockeytown for all it had  has to be one of the dumbest fucking things i ve ever read  when detroit was at its absolute rock bottom worst  going to joe louis arena was probably the only reason suburban white people would ever go into the city and spend money now mike ilitch wants to build a gigantic urban development project including restaurants  shopping stores    apartment complexes   and oh yeah a brand new stateoftheart arena for one of the most successful hockey teams of all time  they have nt missed the playoffs since before i was born  25 years ago they are a big deal and have been for decades   oh  and it s being built at the exact time there s an influx of young people and new businesses into the the city which will create more upward momentum  yes  the city is helping pay for it the city also got a lot of input on it design  layout  and what additional projects would be built along with the arena this happens in every single city an arenastadium is built i do nt necessarily think that s how it should work but the fact of the matter is that this is how these deals are made and the city absolutely needs projects like this if it wants to continue on its upward trend  also attacks on mike ilitch in this article and this thread are disgusting illitch has been a controversial figure for a long time but his story is like example of the american dream you d see in fiction his parents were poor immigrants  he grew up in detroit joined the marines played minor league baseball for the team he now owns opens up a mom and pop pizza place and creates an empire out of it  gets rich while creating jobs and doing public works projects for the city he grew up in even though it s a complete shit hole mike ilitch has been spending  and yes  making  money in detroit for years mike ilitch was there in the 90 s and early 00 s before there was ever a housing crash in the rest of the country the man is nt a saint but if it were nt for him there would be a lot less charities and projects being invested in now he wants to build a project the city desperately needs with the city s help and input  and he s getting shit on by some dumb ass  journalist  that ca nt get their facts straight  endran,7,
66502,someone call charlie leduff,5,
66503,good old cronyism at its finest  nothing new to detroit at all,5,

66506,a city official operating at a congressional level,3,
66507,gt  detroit contractor who negotiated  285 million in public money for the red wings now works with red wings owner so  i love how these headlines are supposed to make us feel outraged,4,
66508,same shit happened here in richardson  texas  a suburb of dallas   the mayor brought in a huge company to the city and then left office to get a job with that same company it also turns out she was having an affair with a guy from that company too,3,
66509,stop giving public money let business deal with business  not government  which can only be scammed and lead to corruption and bloated monopolies promote free market  and separation of power,3,
66510,to be fair  he was working with him then too,1,
66511,i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him,1,
66512,conflict of interests everywhere,1,
66513,this is how it worksthere is nt anything new to this story that is nt happening in nearly every major city and state across the country  i do nt like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it,1,
66514,public money  om,1,
66515,wow  you mean so someone who worked very closely with an organization and built relationships decided to work for said company later on in their career  shocking  i tell you,1,
66516,everyone from the owners to the safety and comfort of the city and everyone thinks this whole plan is going to a country that did not mainly speak my language  i would learn it,1,
66517,what a shocking surprise,1,

66525,gt  the state senate rules committee passed a sweeping  religious freedom  bill on tuesday that would allow faithbased nonprofits that receive public funds to discriminate against lgbt people  what a fucking joke tax dollars will literally be spent discriminating against gay people because of this bill jesus  without the civil rights act the south would still be embracing segregation and hiding behind a bastardized interpretation of the first amendment then as well,1,
66526,it s fun that the government has turned the words freedom and patriot in to code words for tyrannical  and selfish,1,
66527,okay  i m not american  but did nt the senate legalise homosexual marriage  so is nt this unconstitutional,1,
66528,allowing people to do what they want with their own property is nt antigay  it s profreedom and proequality the right to follow your on conscience is as fundamental as the right to follow your own gender identity equality under the law is as far as laws should go,1,
66529,i have 2 problems with this a  fair and equal treatment isnt a right hate to say it  but people are assholes would i refuse to serve someone based on some character trait  no is it still my right to refuse to serve anyone i dont like  assuming that it s my buisiness   you bet your ass it is it s not a smart buisiness plan  but the law doesnt require that i be smart b  how the fuck would someone know that youre gay  i mean  sure some people might fit every single stereotype  but that doesnt mean that they are gay unless they specifically ask  are you gay  and you reply  yes  i am homosexual   which again  is not required by law   how would they be able to destinguish your sexuality  this whole bill is just too messy for my likin,,
66530,can anyone say hillbilly,,

66540,how many hellfire missiles would that buy,8,
66541,this is a great thing people who are bashing him do not make much sense the monuments in dc are one of the united states  greatest treasures  and likewise they cost a lot to maintain let alone refurbish they are a public venue that is traversed by millions and are awesome to each person that visits  this guy decided to use some of his money to give back and better public places that reside in our nation capital and some see him as an asshole  it is one thing to be bitter about not having that kind of money  it is another thing to get pissed when someone with money gives back,7,
66542,its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring,3,
66543,good for him i remember the lincoln memorial being one of my more favorite monuments i d like to take my son there some day  so it s nice to see it will be upgraded and fixed up  to all the naysayers and negative commenters  fuck you,6,

66547,how dare that onepercenter not keep that money to themselves it s as if they are nt evil like sanders wants you to believ,,
66548,i think it s great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about what i do nt like is that there should nt even be an issue with funding for our monuments,3,
66549,if we re committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i m all for it,1,
66550,i wonder how many huge donations like this  maybe smaller  in the hundreds of thousands  have been made for national monuments pretty awesome someone did this wo reading the article  i have to imagine there s a good amount of rigmarole on the donor s end to ensure the donation goes to where the donor actually wanted govt accountability on any level in the us seems kind of weak lately,1,
66551,all right  a 15000sqft exhibit room underneathkind of like the one in fallout ,1,
66552,can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too,1,
66553,oh cool thanks  philanthropist guy,1,
66554,wow  what an honorable thing to do  while 99  of people in his position would spend the money on useless crap  this guy chooses to spend his money on something so selfless and so much bigger than himself  this guy is a good 1  e,,
66555,it d be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro,1,
66556,that s nice for a full on rapist to do,,
66557,let s laugh at people in need by blowing tens of millions on nonessential shit that basically benefits nobody in any significant way  edit  and get tax breaks from it too,,
66558,no matter what some peasant is going to whine rich guy should ve just kept his money to himself and these poors would nt even know  i thank him  i ll go to dc eventually the whiners here probably could nt afford any type of vacation  or if they could  only by living paycheck to paycheck,,
66559,we are living in a new gilded age,,
66560,i certainly appreciate what david has done here but  with all due respect to david  most americans would rather not see financial industry groups  like the carlyle group  suck economic resources out ofaway from most americans instead  we d prefer to pay for these efforts through widespread  robust economic opportunities and the tax contributions they make possible millions of americans and this nation have been greatly diminished as a result of the business activities of groups  like the carlyle group  over several decades  because of grotesque incomewealth inequality  the odds of seeing successful businesspeople like david rubinstein are greatly diminished he only got where he was because of the social ladder that used to exist in this nation,,
66561,how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions,,
66562,it s gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface themfight to take them down,,
66563,those goddamn rich people are at it again  dammit if we could only find a way to tax away their wealth so we could spend it on poorly negotiated deals for mediocre roads and bridges,,
66564,wow  what a waste of money,,
66565,fixing stupid shit is hardly philanthropy,,
66566,i m pretty sure there are roads around there that could have used that money  priorities  people,,

66568,congratulations  you just bought  18 million worth of  charity shaming   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  aksowj8agwo ,,
66569, 18 million  that could have stopped about 6000 kids from dying of malaria   http  wwwgivewellorginternationaltopcharitiesamf  costperlifesaved   one man s philanthropist is another man s guy who does nt see the big picture,,
66572,thats bad news for all the 711 in our town that take the,8,
66573,does nt this just translate into fewer places for poor people to buy food,7,
66574, 711 cashiers will now have to ring up cigarettes as organic kale instead of hot pockets,7,
66575,on the other hand  if the business stops taking food stamps entirely  not only can they not get the kale you want to make them eat  but they also ca nt get a loaf of bread or gallon of milk unless they start selling their food stamps to get cash to buy the milk and bread so the business still makes their money  the amount of food stamp fraud goes up  and the poor that you claim to be helping are getting even less food  healthy or otherwise  because of the food stampcash exchange rate,5,
66576,why are nt food stamps like wic  with wic you get vouchers for specific food items these items cover the basic food groups and align with a certain amount of nutritional value  meanwhile  you can buy friggin monster energy drinks with food stamps that makes no sense  regardless if you are looking at it from a healthy standpoint or a taxpayer standpoint,6,
66577,if obesity and other nutrition related issues are such a problem among the poor  would nt it be more cost effective to do away with food stamps and implement something like a food box program instead  in other words would the cost of labor to package and ship prepared food boxes in bulk to grocery stores and distribution centers be offset by what would be saved in reduced healthcare costs  imagine a program where you list the people in your household  any allergies or specific requirements and a box is prepared to supplement your family for a week it could contain things like rice  beans  canned or pouched goods like meats  vegetables and fruits  dried oatmeal and cereals  powdered milk  cooking oil every month they could receive a selection of 5 spices  salt and pepper and even a recipe pamphlet if in addition to the box  they started a program where grocery stores and produce growers could drop off older or bruised produce  people could pick some up for free when they picked up their boxes,7,
66578,what if the healthy foods do nt sell  are they still forced to stock them  would nt you think the actual grocers in the neighborhood would have a better sense of what their customers want than the federal government,4,
66579,no they ll stop or pack up and leave  ahhhincentives,4,
66580,you can lead them to water  but you ca nt make them drin,5,
66581,we have jackinthebox here in phoenix that has we accept ebt  signs up all over pisses me off  same thing at the gas station when you see children without any parents around loading up on overpriced candy and soda and  sure enough  out comes the ebt card or even worse is when they are  with  the adult and loading up on dog shit  food stamps should only be foractual food,3,
66582,honestly this will be great  the state  should  be very involved in what people eat for free,1,
66583,another  good intention  bad policy,1,
66584,this is the dark side of welfare  the constitution is completely circumvented the government has the power to cajole and pressure when it is putting stipulations on the money it gave out the government is capable of doing things it would never have the power of doing otherwise  like forcing a business to carry certain products  or forcing a person to apply for jobs or eventually  forcing people to work at government labor jobs,,
66585,because dontravious demands fresh cilantro,1,
66586,i wonder how much crime in a store would go down if the store was no longer food stamp approved,1,
66589,i hope they get it right and protest the us department of education if student loans are your issue  go straight to the source of your ills ironically enough  the only way to end student debt is to scale down and eventually eliminate the student loan program,7,
66590, protesters lose jobs for not showing up to work  arrested for nonpayment,7,
66591,i see payday loans taking this route soon,4,
66592,did nt we get rid of debtor s prisons  i m confuse,4,
66593,i believe this happened as i heard this story from other news sources  but some info had to be left out or missing in the us if you owe money on a debt the personcompany has seven years to collect if they do nt the debt disappears if they take you to court and get a judgement they have ten years to collect and it can be renewed for ten more years the only way he could be arrested is if the loan company took him to court  won a judgement and then took further action to force the debtor to court this would not be something to come out of the blue,4,
66594,more from the professional  victim class  i guess you need something to do in between police shootings and sanders rallies,5,
66596,they do not care what police do with them  they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them  edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create  that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all  they do not care about you you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle,8,

66600,good ole harris  i m glad they have branched out from raking the military over the coals for their radios and now get the law enforcement agencies for the stingray,4,
66601,alex jones brought this up long ago  yet hes a kook though right,1,

66604,i ve never heard of court on a saturday thats pretty crazy,9,
66605,the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though,9,
66606,it should be interesting to see how she s ruled in cases of dui in the past,9,
66607,she refused a breathalyzer meh she ll beat thi,9,
66608,would nt being drunk compromise her ability to judge  how many times has she been impaired while working  should nt anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least  what should i make for dinner,9,

66619,well who s gon na judge the case now,5,
66620,her judgement was impaire,6,
66621,fry needs to weigh in here  http  imgurcomgvji0u,5,
66622,to be clear  the fact that she refused a breathalyzer is important in many states it is treated as evidence of impairment and justification for arrest she knew that i have many friends who are criminal defense attorneys and all have told me they advise to refuse breathalyzer always  unless there is a court order  i m not familiar with ny law  but i can pretty much guarantee she will not be convicted of dui if middle classcollege kids can get out of them  a federal judge surely can since it said nothing about a field sobriety test  i assume they either did nt administer one  or they did and she did not meet criteria for impairment,5,
66623,my friends mom is a judge and that lady boozes super hard and will drive her car around i have seen her come home from the bar completely in ruins at least a dozen times over the last 10 years she is fearless  we live in a small town in wisconsin with a huge police presence she knows all the officers and has never had an issue the whole situation seems completely ridiculous she gives out sentences for dui all day and then drives drunk all night oh god  the hypocrisy,5,

66646,gt   the order is vague and because it imposes disproportionate  intrusive  and punitive measures against households and businesses with   no due process     did nt see that one coming,9,
66647,isps do nt actually want to spy on their customers like that it costs more money to put systems in place to do so and to maintain and operate those systems on top of that  it will only bring them bad press that could piss off customers  cox is basically saying  fuck you i m not taking a significant financial hit to spy on our customers so you can sue them and make money for yourself  they are doing the right thing  and the right thing also happens to be in their best business interest,9,
66648,good guy cox  not selling out their customers  they actually have super reliable internet no outages in any of my apartments so far,9,
66649,so to sum that up we do nt have to worry about any cox blocking,9,
66650,that s nice  but i m still going to run a vpn,8,
66651,all in all i ve been pretty happy with cox as an isp i ve used them in two different cities and it s always been reliable and fast i pay for 300mbps service and always get those speeds  usually higher almost no outages they re putting in 1gbs service in many of their cities right now  including mine  my biggest gripe with them is they have a soft data cap of 2 tb for my tier they do not enforce the caps at all but the fact that they exist means they are probably toying with the idea and there would be nothing to stop them from going evil since they are a monopoly like every other major isp it s like a benevolent dictatorship  http  wwwspeedtestnetmyresult5089441276 that s with a netflix stream going on in another room right now,9,
66652,this must be a new thing many a year s ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did nt even know what that was  none of us knew what that even was and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi,7,
66653,i ve been really happy with cox for an isp both personally and professionally here in okc personally  out of nowhere they bumped my at home connection from 15mbit to 100mbit and my bill  went down  30  all out of nowhere  without me saying a word internet is always up  not throttled  and they have decent support if it s needed  professionally at my job i ran in ip phone deployment with them for our main office  3 satellite offices they were there 100  of the way i have personal names and numbers to call in the event of issues outside of the scope of my support as the companies it admin  and when we ve needed someone on site to climb a pole for instance their longest response time was 45 minutes  i know this sounds like rhailcorporate but the fact is out of all the isps i ve had  comcast  qwest  charter  etc  they ve been the best that s not saying they should nt and could nt be better  but they re angels next to the others  in fact they proactively contact me at work every once and awhile to check on things which i greatly appreciate and they bring us cookies every month yes  our isp brings yes cookies no  we re not a big company 9 employees they re just nice,7,
66654,basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum,8,
66655,i used to work for cox in the field and inside cox did have a department that would monitor massive down loading and uploading but they did away with it shortly after i got there  within a year cox ca nt afford to lose customers right now so it s no surprise they are nt allowing this if they did then they would go out of business from customer loss i survived their huge layoff and realignment,5,
66656,this is nothing new from cox i have had cox internet for over 10 years and worked for them a few years ago they have always had this attitude toward it s customers the customer pays for internet access  cox provides internet access they do nt even enforce data caps  at least in oklahoma   i have received a few emails due to using so much data suggesting that i switch to a business plan to maximize my speed  but have never been charged extra or cut off due to exceeding a data cap,6,
66657,gt  last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers  what the actual fucking fuck,6,
66658,as a customer this is the first good thing i ve ever heard from cox,4,
66659,not true from my experience,3,
66660,i ve had them as an isp for several years and they re excellent i did have one month where i went over my allowed bandwidth limit  300 gb on a 50 mbps down plan   and all i got was an email saying  do nt do that again   no throttling or charges or anything on 100 mbps down plan right now and i usually get 110 at least they re great  come out to me if i m having internet trouble that s not solved by online support  etc pretty good basically  i love cox and i m very satisfied with how much i get,3,
66661,unrelated but i could nt stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox,3,
66662,i am a proud supporter of cox,3,
66663,where are all the penis jokes,3,
66664,not as nice as it sounds if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do nt catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status  eg that they do nt have any liabilityresponsibility for what people use their pipe for   most carriers are  very  vested in not being the internet police,3,
66665,i m guessing that if they had a way to monetize it and add to the bottom line  they d be very supportive,3,
66666,when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battl,5,
66667,cox is actually a familyowned business one of the major interest holders is a 96 year old woman who inherited from her father  she had been running it with her sister until her death in 2007   i happen to think they re one of the leastshady isp and cable providers out there  they also own the travel channel  which is a pretty great channel,4,
66668,i thought this was talking about jesse cox,5,
66669,i work for cox corporate in a startup tech company  and this makes me so happy  btw  they re just as decent an employer as they are an isp compan,3,
66670,cox is spying like a champ  rest assured you have to be quite innocent or high on meth to think they have nt supplied info to big brother and his little brothers  and will not in the future,3,
66671,on that headline alone  i thought jessie cox was asked to spy on his youtube subs  was very confused for a little bit,1,

66677,they sent me a few emails in the past  so i got a vpn i will still use it  but good on cox for not being dickbags,1,
66678,they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jone,1,
66679,i had cox for 3 years service was good  and over that 3 years  doubled my download speeds twice no extra cost upload was still garbage  but hey 10015 internet for  65 a month was still pretty killer i have 7575 fios now,1,
66680,almost every single person in my area that has gone to atamp  t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable  they have some shit with them but it s far less shit than others,1,

66685,between cox and cable one in both places i live  i actually like our midwest internet providers i feel bad for people getting rammed by twc and comcast we ve paid  45 for 100mbps for several years  which sounds way better than the horror stories i hear from you guys,1,

66742,good for him  football does nt have to be a concussion prone sport it started as the american version of rugby  and evolved into the form we see today  and can just as properly evolve into something that is nt effectively a form of human sacrifice  part of how it evolved is the career of pop warner  the coach of the carlisle indian school he kept  how to put it  coaching like a lawyer  and coming up with clever ways to get an edge  that would then eb slapped down with rule changes  surely concussions justify rule changes too,7,

66801,great  now reddit is stealing other people s diversity hires  jesus  there really is just no oc on this site anymore  is there,6,
66802,just as a precaution  i think we all should be putting on our life jackets,6,
66803,does this dude give off  profitability  pixie dust when he walks around the office  what is causing all of these companies  reddit  yahoo  twitter  vox  salon  mashable  github  gawker  etc  in decline to try and make up for shitty business practices with diversity hires  it does nt matter how many black activist and feminists you hire  that wont solve a lack of profitability and coming from a company that tanked  and you were suppose to be part of the solution  is nt exactly a gold star on your resume you are suppose to jump ship from companies that are failing not get on board,7,
66804,aka manipulator in chief,6,
66805,so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming and this was the great marketing that is killing them,5,
66806,that seems like quite a comedown  with all due respect to this fine institution,3,
66807,let s see what shitty changes they come up with 144 character limit  perhaps,5,
66808,it s about ethics in reddi,3,
66809,just read about how twitter is filtering political content of a particular kind good news for reddit  they re on their way to being another propaganda wing of the left,1,
66810,great  a news manager  amp  head of journalism  with the attention span of one sentence  and the intellectual depth of a drunk on a 24 hour train ride  note  reddit is a whore for anything that emanates out of the roman catholic ponzi generating pope s pie hole perhaps the new head of journalism  could find another criminal organization to support on reddit instead of the catholic church criminal empire,,
66812,i was happier before i knew this subculture existed,9,
66813,so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10 that does nt make much sense,9,
66814,how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killedhow from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human,9,
66815,one of these videos was sent to me many years ago  forwarded on a myspace page  yeah  many  years ago   they were trying to  raise awareness  when they sent it to me to help the people get caught  but all they really ended up doing was spreading that ghastly thing to more points of the internet i wo nt describe a single second of it  but suffice it to say that it s horrifying i ve never been able to remove the memory i ve been through a lot in my military career  and yet seeing a 2minute version of one of those videos was easily the most horrible thing i have ever witnessed,9,
66816,gt  brent justice  54  was convicted and sentenced monday for cruelty to nonlivestock animals  i guess justice has been served,9,
66817,i ca nt imagine the mentality of the person making it or watching it and people get off on it    who the hell sees a cat being stabbed in the eye and thinks  hey  time to get the jergens  ,9,
66818,no complaints from me but i ve noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago,9,
66819,for once  reading a story of horrifying animal abuse does nt fill me with rage this must be what justice feels like finally  an appropriate sentence so sick of people like these getting slaps on the wrist due to inadequate animal protection laws,9,
66820,i read the title then thought  hhmmm what s an animal crush video   who would have thunk it  animal crush videos are videos of animals getting crushed there goes some of the little remaining faith i had in humanit,9,
66821,i m not saying this is nt some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder,9,
66822,psa  if for some reason you come here first  and you do nt know what crush videos are  please do nt look them up,8,
66823,houston man is trying to compete with florida man  and this is definitely an act i hope florida man does nt try to top,8,
66824,i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens wtfi just dont understan,8,
66825,who the fuck beats off to animals being killed  what the fuc,8,
66826,there are some very fucked up people in this world to me  it is inconceivable how someone does this,8,
66827,only 10 minutes in  and i ve already had enough reddit for today,5,
66828,gt  investigators said justice filmed a scantily clad richards  sometimes masked  stabbing animals  including a puppy  a kitten and a chicken  as well as chopping off their limbs and urinating on them while making sexual comments to the camera  what the actual fuck,6,
66829,you know when you really  really wish you had nt read the article linked to  this is one of those times right now,7,
66830,you can kill your spouse  drunk drive and kill 4 people  steal millions of dollars from the american people  or molest dozens of children in a church of a period of 30 years and literally get less jail time when we say we love our doggos  and kittys   we fucking mean it,5,
66831,i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective it was the first exposure i d ever had to this subculture  crush fetish   after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals  their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse that s all i have to say about that,1,
66833,as someone who just for the first time heard the term animal crush videos  i wash that i had nt something is seriously wrong with you if this is what gets you off,7,
66834,well that just ruined my da,6,
66835,i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed ,5,
66836,fuck people are fucked,5,
66837,if slaughter houses had glass walls  everyone would quit eating animals the cognitive dissonance in here is incredible,4,
66838,i definitely think this guy should be punished and i m glad he was punished  but it blow my mind how a guy like this can get 50 years and a pedophile or rapist can get 1020 or less,5,
66839,i do nt understand how the sicko who did the maiming and killing gets 10 years  but the man who filmed it gets 50 that woman should not see light ever again,1,
66842,how screwed up would you have to be,1,
66843,i do nt understand how this happens in a state with safe surrender laws,1,
66845,i hope they left quietly after looking in the window  they might enjoy this over at rwalkingdea,4,
66846,pfft  what  really  happened was that the onduty cops did nt have cable at their station so they watched it through the windows,4,
66847,we also fire up the surround sound amp when the walking dead comes on  but we do nt keep any windows open i wonder if the propane bomb scene is what triggered the 911 cal,4,
66848, a show about firearms  more like a show about a group of survivors of a zombie apocalypse but whatever,4,
66849, it was the tee vee  i m sorry it disturrrbed you now it s rather late   nurse diese,1,
66850,is nt it heartwarming how tv can still bring the whole family together,1,
66852,if the proposal came from a doctor or scientist  i would be 100  on the side of this bill but it comes from a senator  which makes me want to question it  scientific papers require peer review from the most qualified people to call bullshit on an idea before you can get it published as legitimate i m not saying i m questioning the idea  but i do nt know enough about the process of bills and laws to give it my automatic seal of approval  i think it s a good idea to administer anesthesia to an unborn human that can feel pain whether or not it increases the cost of abortion but the cost is still a talking point all i can do is hope that the people in charge of the decision in the end have the same concerns that i do,8,
66853,i mean  we already use anesthesia on fetuses when performing surgery in the womb for exactly this reason  so it s hardly surprising  http  wwwdoctorsonfetalpaincomfetalpaintheevidence5documentatio,7,
66854,wether a fetus is under anesthesia is completely dependent on the type of anesthetic being performed any general anesthetic also anesthetizes the fetus while other types like spinal or local do not even then  there is no accurate way to quantify or measure awareness in fetuses  much less adults undergoing anesthesia the body also still responds to pain under anesthesia  as its an autonomic response  so the definition of  feeling pain  is not something that should be measured i feel like awareness  which is impossible to measure in a fetus regardless  is a real idicator of humanity an easy solution would be to simply do all elective abortions under general anesthesia  which may cost more  but is easily doable i have no idea what the preferred method of anesthesia is  if any  for elective abortions  source  i do anesthesia in a catholic hospital,5,
66855,i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them,7,
66856,they have nt decided at what point of gestation this would happen  gt  montana lawmakers passed a similar law in 2015 requiring fetal anesthesia before surgeries  including abortion  after 20 or more gestational weeks  so  4 months the general consensus for viability outside the womb is around 6 monthsish for some the concept of consciousness coincides with viability outside the womb,6,
66857, this is a review on fetal pain   http  jamajamanetworkcomarticleaspx  articleid  201429amp  resultclick  1  from clinical review  although it is 10 years old it says  gt  evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques similarly  limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion,5,
66858,is nt this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor s office  would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder,4,
66859,i m going to talk about this as delicately as possible i  genuinely  want thoughts and opinions on this subject  i am asking that no one become immediately offended by what i m about to say rather than respond with your opinion telling me why you believe that my view should change i am childfree i do nt want kids  i m 35  so it s pretty much set in stone at this juncture in my life i do nt see myself as a prolife or prochoice supporter and the reason for that is because i kind of agree with both sides on one hand i firmly believe that the destruction of a human being  born or not  is murder it fits the definition  of  murder before you downvote me into oblivion  let me be clear it s not the votes i care about it s that you understand where i m coming from even though i have that belief  i also believe that some people were just not meant to be children but therein lies another debate  why do nt they place it in adoption  because most of the time unwanted children are kept  they re not placed into adoption and when they re kept their chances of being neglected as children  whether it be mentally  emotionally  or physically  rise exponentially i certainly would nt want to have a child and resent it i  do nt  have children because frankly i m mean as a damn snake i do nt see any part of me that could ever have a child and not lose my temper with it and i would nt put a kid through that  because  i  was put through that i would be a horrible parent  anyway  i have a point i swear if you re going to have an abortion  why anesthetize it first  do i believe that it can feel  absolutely  but you re killing it i mean it s not like you re putting it to sleep and saying   here  fight for your life  you re fucking killing it so why have a crisis of conscience about it  again  i m sorry if i offend anyone  that s not my intention i m just a realistic person and it is what it is sugarcoating it does nt change it the bill seems like a waste of time and tax dollars  edit  i do nt understand why this is being downvoted so  please  give me your views instead of leaving me wondering because if there s something i m not understanding it needs to be made clear again this is absolutely not about the votes rather than having a discussion,,

66905,comcast is used to pissing people off they wo nt give a fuck,9,
66906,you could probably just sticky this post  have no link from it or replies available that is how permanent of an issue this is,9,
66907,we want google fiber and we want it now,9,
66908,if a telephone company has this large a problem  they have to meet with the fcc and show cause most likely there would also be a hefty fine but  not cable networks because they are deemed nonessential,7,
66909,not news to me i have a 3 hour outage at least once a month with comcast a 1020 minute outage daily around 56 am  and at least 34 10 minute outages sprinkled throughout the week  i know this because 2 out of every 5 or 6 dvr recorded shows are fucked up during the middle   absolutely awful i live in a moderate city  too  so it s not like i m in the middle of fucking nowhere,7,
66910,and then they wonder why people are ready to go to google fibe,7,
66911,loss of internet and television access for 3 days would cause mass panic and riot,8,
66912,my bad people i went over my 300gb and used way too much of an infinite resource,7,
66913,wow  17k outages nationwide for as much as 3 hours  obama needs to step in and fix this for sure ,9,
66914,gt  across us i bet i could find thousands who are angry at comcast  in my town alone ,5,
66915,i m fully expecting to get downvoted to hell here  but what the heck  i m not particularly fond of comcast  but unless i missed something here  which is entirely possible   this does nt actually sound like it was particularly horrific for people in general it sounds like a very small fraction of their nationwide customer base  had an outage of parts of their service for about 3 or 4 hours  not even all of their service  but things like they could nt access their hd channels  or their internet did nt work for a few hours  i understand for businesses  an internet outage can be a big deal  so some outrage on their part would be justified  but for the general consumer  come on  get a grip go read a book for a while  or go outside for a bit  or  gasp  go do something with your family  i m just not getting what the huge deal was here  what am i missing,7,
66916,i was part of the outage did nt have internet and only had access to about 8 sd channels i ll be honest  3 hours where i have to use my phone for internetsi could nt care less had to go out and shovel anyway  edit  couldgt  could n,7,
66917,not a fan of comcast  but with this outage they probably still provide 9999  uptime bunch of whiners  yes  i work in it,6,
66918,i like how this is news in this country,7,
66919,comcast angers me even without outages,7,
66920,the words  anger  and  comcast  come up often,4,
66921,there needs to be legally mandated uptime and speed requirements  95  of the time your connection must reach the  advertised  speed  no more  up to xmbps  allowed  and 99  of the time it must reach 14 of that speed if this is nt met then customers must be completely refunded for that month,4,
66922,is anyone else still completely fucking down  just everything  been down for 15 hours here,4,
66923,quote from the article   comcast has more than 27 million customers  and 89000 of those are new cable subscribers the company signed on last quarter that was its best performance in eight years  correct me if i m wrong but are nt there 2 choices for most people  sign up with comcast or do nt have high speed internet  it s like bragging because people choose to eat food from the only supplier rather than starve to death,4,
66924,comcast seems to be an isp that people love to hate  charter got so bad for so many years that i loved to hate them in all honesty  the past three to four years or so they have been great,7,
66925,customer service replied   working as intended,3,
66926,i ve had comcast xfinity for almost 2 years now and i ve never had an issue,5,
66927,fun story i was at a friend s place watching the superbowl in denver comcast blacked out cbs with 1 minute 26 seconds left on the clock in second quarter  and service was nt restored till about 15 seconds before 3rd quarter kicked off  idk how widespread this was but lots of denverites did nt get to see the super bowl halftime show i d imagine comcast would lose a lot of money if their advertisers paid to have a certain amount of views and one of the biggest markets  since denver was participating in the super bowl  cut out all views during the entire halftime show idk how their whole contract with that stuff goes though  i hear i did nt miss much though,4,
66928,that s what happens things go out sometimes,3,
66929,friend of mine called to ask why he couldnt connect  he obviously cant check if there are outages in his neighborhood without the internet  he calls them and they offer to send a tech to his house for like  80  they didnt tell him the price  but you know itd be up there  he spends an hour checking all his connections  digging through paperwork to find his modem settings page  finally calls back about 8hrs later hoping to talk to someone else and theyre like   oh yeah  there s an outage in your area   idiots,4,
66930,when i called  i was disconnected 3 times this is great customer nonservice beside the lack of tv thanks comcast for helping me make my change from you  easier,1,
66931,it s nothing new that comcast absolutely sucks,1,
66932,when you deal with technology  there is only one thing i can guarantee you it will get down at the worst possible time,1,
66933, compact angers thousands across the us for something other than just being comcast for once  ftf,1,
66934,they just put a data cap on my home internet how fucked is that  pretty fucked if you ask me,1,
66935,what is the most troubling about comcast is that when there is an outtage  it doesnt effect just a small region  but instead downs multiple states that seems so rediculous,1,
66936,once they fix the outage you re left with  comcast anger thousands across us,1,
66937,now only 1000 years to lrrr ruler of the planet omicron persei 8 comes to destroy earth,1,
66938,it s not like we re losing  that  much more bandwidth it s only like 20 megs less than what we had before which was only 80 megs less than what we re paying for,1,
66939,so  i had to get comcast recently because i moved and noticed something weird about my bill the letter in the mail has a different due date than the due date that shows up on the online account just saying folks make sure to pay 2 days before your date at least,1,
66940,just having comcast in general makes them angry,1,
66941, nsfw how comcast really feels   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  kmcny_pixdw,1,
66942,once in a while fios is out for a few hours hard to get too pissed  these things do happen i do nt think comcast needs an outage to be hated honestly though for me they were a decent provider  i never had a single issue with them except for the occasional outage,1,
66943,wow now that s comcastic,1,
66944,it was out for like 3 hours jesus christ,1,
66945,my comcast service  for the first time in years  has actually been pretty good lately but i d like to pay less  so i m rooting for google fiber to come to boston simply so i can reap the benefits of competition  i mean  that s what we really want  right  we do nt want yet another monopoly  no matter how  altruistic  we think google will be  we want the existing monopolies to be forced into providing quality service for a reasonable price  along with other choices,1,
66946,it probably still worked better than my centurylink ds,1,
66947,comcast s response   it pays the restoration fee  or else it gets the hose again,1,
66948,my case  as in many others  boils down to this  you can pay triple the amount for the same throughput speeds or you can curse comcast and wait for google fiber,1,
66949,at the same time  i would nt want to be on the other end and get screamed at from 10k  people experiencing the outage i just went out instead of being at home it s aggregating that it happens so often  at the same time there are other things to d,1,
66950,they should just switch providers if they are nt satisfied  see what i did there ,1,
66951,after this comcast will just be turning off their services everywhere after all  they could save a ton of money that way,1,
66952,for comcast  it was tuesday,1,
66953,spread your cheeks  most of you wo nt even complain or ask for a billing credit,1,
66954,title should just be  comcast angers thousands across us   i fucking hate comcast with every fiber of my being  reasons  i  paying top dollar for slow as shit internet  ii  a modemrouter combo that broadcasts an unsecured public network from your home which has to be manually deactivated  iib  said modem has to be forced reset once a week  and doing so undoes the manual changes you made to get rid of the second network  iii  arbitrary data caps  iv  live television that freezes  v  ondemand that works infrequently  and turns into minecraft porn when it crashes  vi  customer  service  that refuses to listen to what your problem is  but instead tries to upsell you on a more advanced package  one of my dreams is to live long enough to see this shit stain regional monoploy of a company implode upon itself  or be run straight into the fucking grave by google fiber,1,
66955,i always laugh at this shit until i remember i m with twc  the   second   worst rated isp in america,1,
66956,where i live i would love to have this proble,1,
66959,this is why a lot of former cops are setting up companies where they transport the cash for it it s also a huge motivation for the stores to keep 2 separate sets of books  a real one and one the irs gets to see,9,
66960,this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day,9,
66961,gt  one of the three men who escaped from a california jail last month had been charged with kidnapping a marijuana dispensary owner that they suspected had hidden large amounts of cash in the desert the man and his accomplices are accused of driving the dispensary owner out to the desert  torturing him and cutting off his penis  sheesh i m not carrying more than  10 in my wallet from now on  and that has nothing to do with the fact that i m broke,9,
66962,this is why they get robbed all the time out here no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys,7,
66963,ca nt these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us,8,
66964,there s a great documentary on netflix called  high profits  about a business in breckenridge  co right before full legalization took effect  one of the big issues was exactly this only being able to do business in cash from payroll to paying city taxes they had  120k in cash they had to just walk into the front of the city building with and that was just the first month alone  some of the people that make the drops to the shops are walking out with  10k in their pockets and no security at all it s terrifying,8,
66965,civil forfeiture time,6,
66966,ironically  it s also just flat out illegal to own large sums of money anything over a few hundred bucks  and the government can sieze that money  because the money committed the crime of intent to purchase narcotics,9,
66967,time to start using gold,5,
66968,so the tax man will gladly take cannadollars  but the banks will not this is ridiculously stupid,5,
66969,same deal in washington still have to buy my shit with cash oh but i can buy cigs and alcohol with a card no problem  if you want to pick up a gram here or there it s no problem  but i buy in bulk  since it s cheaper that means i need to stop by the bank to get  140 that s the only time i carry that much money on me  it s like requiring a personal check to get a passport no cashier s check  no card wtf it s 2016,7,
66970,are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money,5,
66971,this war on cash is such bullshit  people carried cash until 12 years ago and it was perfectly fine  now they are trying to restrict flying with cash  purchasing with cash  seizing cash   the only problem is that the money is due on one day  they need to have the tax office take payment on any day of the week  so it s stacked,6,
66972,i wonder how negative interest rates  if implemented  would effect the marijuana business these value of the business would probably increase as they had large sums of cash on hand their credit worthiness would increase because they had something of value  cash  but they would be penalized for depositing that cash according to the recent imf working paper i wonder if they would become attractive targets for some banks to help capitalize their weak balance sheets,3,
66973,oh well let you do business  but you just wo nt be able to use any banks what a backwards ass countr,3,

66991,it s the same way in washington and colorado it s still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed,1,
66992,since the money cant be deposited into a bank would a good option to take be converting it into precious metals such as gold  you would still need to store the gold but that could be easily done in a safety deposit however unless you know where to go  getting that much gold could raise the attention of people you dont want raised to begin with it s not like in china or india  if you show up with a briefcase of cash and walk out with a smaller case of gold  no one really cares,1,

66999,living in germany and studying  i m gon na pay 300   335   for the upcoming semester  these 335  also includes a public transportation ticket  which is in your student id  that allows me to take the train  bus  tram etc at any time as much as i like in my entire state  books are nt nearly as expensive as in the us  the most expensive book i bought last semester was 80   89    but  seriously  95  of the content for the majority of the courses are uploaded on the university s website  files and documents which you can download for free  also  the university canteen offers you decent food for a fair price  normally around 35   in the end my biggest expenses during my semester are the coffees i buy on campu,9,
67000,i m from the uk and have lived in germany for 6 years now i came here with a 20000 gbp student loan for a 4 year degree in computer science  now i m about to start a masters in web science that will cost me about 1000 eur for the 2 year course  parttime and remote  i m also just about to get german citizenship  most germans are happy to speak english  i have a job here and although most of the company speak english they make i point of speaking german with me  and i with them  i m not very good at german but am slowly learning now after 5 years of being very lazy about learning the language it s a very hard language to learn  screw those articles   but in time you ll get used to it  i absolutely love speaking to locals in german and being understood by them  to me it s like being on another planet and finally being accepted by the local populus  good luck to anyone who wants to come over  it is a wise move  come and see me near koblenz,9,
67001,a friends son went to college in switzerland  we are american  even though he paid additional fees as a non native  and had to travel back and forth to europe  he still paid less than kids who went to local colleges,9,
67002,come gather around the fire and listen to a tale of a spooky and simple explanation of our increasing tuition rates in the us  the government started giving student loans kids take the debt  the schools get the money tuition prices increase because they can rely on the kids to get a gov loan take away student loans  then schools ca nt rely on this money  kids ca nt afford the jacked up tuitions  enrollments drop  schools are forced to cut tuition  now more affordable again it s the same problem with mortgage crisis  just a different industry,9,
67003,it s almost as if germany sees the benefit of having a well educated work force that is not bogged down by insurmountable debt,9,
67004,my college actually sodomizes me,9,
67005,whereas here in the states  they will gladly charge you a  250semester parking fee and you will still not actually be guaranteed a space,8,
67006,maybe i should go to germany,9,
67007,currently living in germany  as an american student on an international internship  what this is nt telling you is that the uni system is significantly different my roommates  all in engineering or other sciences  study all day every day they have a month of exams coming up  and they usually have only one exam per year you fail that  you fail no assignments  projects  etc  just that exam  did i mention this was a fraternity  yeah  they do nt go to uni because everyone does it  like america they work  they get accepted  and they work even more it is nt for partying  it is nt for meeting your spouse or friends  it s for becoming the best you can be  which is how a university should be  good luck to the americans coming here thinking it s anything like the states enjoy the d  ner,9,
67008,something like this gets posted everysingleweek without fail and then a bunch of americans start making hasty decisions to just go study in germany because it s  free   oh and it has been this way for years so it is nt a new thing  the german courses that you will have to take for at least a year to reach fluency are around  300 a month and noduolingo is absolutely not enough to get you to the level you need to study at university  the fees for applications are at  75 then an additional 15  for each university you apply to after the first it can go well into the hundreds  the bank account you have to open for your student visa has to have a frozen amount of at least approx   8500 this is nt to say it is impossible but do nt expect roses and rainbows and raining beer amp  wurst to await your easy university life in germany  also american universities except the few ivy leagues or outstanding schools  baby the absolute shit outta you you can pretty much sail smoothly your first two years while you get your core courses out of the way in germany  you jump right into it in german remember  a different language a crazy  difficult language at that the high school diploma is also not equivalent to the german one that allows you to study at a university the equivalent would be a plethora of ap courses with really good grades or a high school diploma plus two years of college with really good grades and then you re equivalent to a german high school graduate  you will also most likely not be able to transfer credits  german bureaucracy  a bitch you will have to have german knowledge when applying for your visas or someone to be a translator there with you  you may have to do a prep year for certain programs as well it is also very competitive to get into even these programs  i sound like fucking scrooge but i ve been through all of it as so have many people i met along the way  it is possible but it will take a lot of hard work and dedication and time that you wo nt regret  losing  because it may not work out perfectly you may get rejected you may not be accepted for that semester a lot of the popular programs have a cap so it s very restricted in terms of amount of students accepted  do nt expect germany to be a country that is just waiting and fiddling its thumbs for the americans to come and study in their unis for  free  and think that they re gon na make it easy for you it is anything but,9,
67009,my american husband started learning german at the age of 26 a year later he was admitted to vet school here he s almost finished now we ve been paying 120 euros a semester i think he s the only foreign student to not drop out in his class though the drop out rate is high even for germans while he s happy he is debt free  the immense stress of having to learn a very hard subject in a foreign language and a foreign system  bureaucracy is insane here   have caused many panic attacks and one major case of depression and he has nt even started the huge final exam yet but at least we wo nt be  200k in debt when this is over,8,
67010,the fee is actually 150500  per semester books inclusive because of librarys and because we live in 2016 and share digitaly public transport also free  you get 600  per month plus health care  if your parents arent rich  this will be checked by government  as student  and will have to pay back   half of that   in worst conditions after you finished  also  after 3 semesters you must have passed 23 of your finals at any time to get your  baf  g  money  but this will only be checked once no money for extra semesters of course,9,
67011,in my opinion let them come here  let them study here and let them stay here if they want besides the fact that the ones who stay make up for the cost of education it is a great way of cultural exchange  it s always nice to have friends from different countries  so if you are coming to the area of n  rnberg just text me ,8,
67012,currently living in duisburg  germany and studying at the university of duisburgessen   my choice   i grew up in the us  but my parents are from germany after graduating high school it became apparent that studying in germany was an opportunity that i could not pass up i chose my current uni because it has an international studies in engineering program which allows me to pursue a bachelors degree in computer engineering with the first year taught entirely in english   costs   the costs are definitively low the semester fee  including public transport  is below 300   my total living expenses are below 700  a month and that includes health insurance   my experience so far   keep in my mind i m still in my first semester  as others have mentioned before  the majority of students quit after the first year last year  the failure rate of an exam taken by 200 students was over 95   attending lectures is completely voluntary and there is one exam at the end of each course that makes up 100  of your final course grade no homework is given and you are very much on your own forcing yourself to focus and learn everyday can be a serious challenge  feel free to comment or pm with any questions,7,
67013,many american students also come with very false expectations about what german university is like you have to be way more self organised and please do nt expect multiple choice tests,9,
67014,we need to stop this immigration because when america sends its people  it sends unskilled people and we have to spend our money on them we are going to build a wall  get america to pay for it and make germany great again,9,
67015,you can only offer something for free if you limit supply fewer germans go to college than us students   only 30  of germans ages 2534 have completed a tertiary education  which includes academic degrees and some but not all vocational programs that  s below the oecd average  and below the us 45  attainment rate for the same age group  http  wwwlatimescomlocaleducationcommunitylameedufreecollegeeducationingermanybutnotincalifornia20151029htmlstoryhtml edit  so now i am amused that many people are suggesting that fewer people should go to college in the us  presumably other people  not so much themselves they are smart   it seems like this would be a less popular proposal than promising free tuition,9,
67018,how enforceable is this really  what do we do when we find tons of food that turns out to be from an illicit source  destroy it,6,
67019,i had no idea this was even a thin,4,
67020,good luck is nt that the entire shrimp industry,3,
67021,why was nt this a law like 80 years ago ,1,
67022,even if it s not perfect or entirely enforceable yet  it s a first and important step in doing the right thing,1,
67023,i live in a small fishing town and sometimes the price they get for their fish is equivalent to slave labor,1,
67024,all goods from slave labor,1,

67032,i believe we have gangs that are setting these kids up with a hair trigger  and along comes a cop that sets them off  we need to get to the root problem as well as locking up the kids,7,

67042,i do nt understand reddit says that loggers and farmers have more dangerous jobs,,
67043,another prime blm example,,
67044,hope he gets a fair trial y,,
67045,so this guy is innocent until proven guilty right  why is this investigation so short  we do nt know the details  why does it take a year to investigate an officer for shooting someone  and this takes a couple of days to charge this guy  is that disconnect enough to make anyone here question things enough to accept that there is a massive encompassing problem with our legal system  i always have to wonder because we see many of the same people calling for people to wait for details after an officer shoots someone  telling us not to be monday morning quarterbacks then stories like this pop up and we have those same people frothing at the mouth in this situation where it has nt been given the year plus of investigation that an officer who shoots someone would be given the guy is already guilty despite the cries to give officers the benefit of the doubt because of the innocent until proven principle,,
67046,how the hell do you survive a gunshot to the face  that s some 50 cent shit,,

67048,it s about damn time we made sure innocent good people had guns and training and could defend themselves   or we could stop giving guns to everybody gee i do nt kn,
67049,maybe the cop was making furtive movements,,
67052,fucking sad how this was nt described as an act of terrorism i guess that title is reserved for nonchristians,9,
67053,it is sad that it closed even for a short time people like fiorina do nt give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time,8,
67054,definitely not terrorism though  just a little rampage  you know he was probably having a bad day or something,8,
67055,good for them  dont let those freedom hating assholes scare you away from your job,8,
67056,how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him,4,
67057,is carly out of the race yet  i do nt think that rightwing  fringe conartist is done riling up her terrorist sect,7,
67058,deadly rampage  was  terrorist attack  a little too onthenose,7,
67059,why does this headline say  deadly rampage  and not  christian terrorism ,5,
67060,now i m not a fan of abortions but who the hell can think to themselves i know how to stop babies from being aborted  i ll just shoot all the moms and their doctors  absolute lunatic,1,

67062,on president s day   the gaul,,
67063,so  someone went on a shooting rampage and killed people in order to stop planned parenthood from killing people  but now planned parenthood is open again  and proudly killing people  well  i am glad that worked out the entire thing makes tons of sense,,
67064,pp is where there is regular deadly rampages against unborn babies,,
67065,planned parenthood is basically condoms and the oklahoma city bombing,,
67067,well shit i just read a til like last week about him still being alive,1,
67068,his fatal mistake was using that old refrigerator to play hide and seek,1,
67070,i grew up in a very small rural town  the high school i attended is part of a huge high school rivalry  one of the biggest in the nation hell its not uncommon for 20000 plus fans to attend the rivalry game  its so big it s held in a college stadium and has more people attend it then the college division 1 team any way i have friends and family members who are convinced the only way to go to college and make something out of yourself is to get there on a football scholarship one of my cousins young kid 16ish has already had a few concussions  his dad just chalks it up to part of the game and thinks parents need to stop being such  pussies  football is for men and if a boy ca nt take it he will never be a man sadly i think a lot of parents feel this way,9,
67071,smart move by him  if anything athletes should be focusing back on baseball guaranteed money and long contract,9,
67072,and it begins  the exodus away from our national infatuation with football,8,
67073,tbi survivor here and former football fanatic even had a denver broncos tat which has since been covered with some other nonsense anyway  brain injuries are obviously bad news as is the nfl s handling of them  i hope this becomes a trend,7,
67074,good for him  football does nt have to be a concussion prone sport it started as the american version of rugby  and evolved into the form we see today  and can just as properly evolve into something that is nt effectively a form of human sacrifice  part of how it evolved is the career of pop warner  the coach of the carlisle indian school he kept  how to put it  coaching like a lawyer  and coming up with clever ways to get an edge  that would then eb slapped down with rule changes  surely concussions justify rule changes too,7,
67075,i played football for 4 years in highschool started all 4 years i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fu,3,
67076,this is really just a click bait story no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers  i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is,5,
67077,who would let their son play american football,1,
67078, he s made a terrible mistake    https  wwwredditcomrnewscomments462zg514yearold_wisconsin_basketball_player_impaled_by,1,
67079,suffered some pretty brutal concussions playing hoops in high school and college if he is looking to mitigate his risk  he might want to rethink athletics all together,1,
67080,the student   i did nt want my life to end up as part of a shitty movie like concussion ,1,
67081,plot twist  he ca nt shoot,1,
67082,there are so many cool sports out there that have gone down in popularity that are cool out therewrestling for example,1,
67083,i hope he wears a big ass helmet all the time in order to avoid irony them baseballs travel fast,,
67085,thats bad news for all the 711 in our town that take the,8,
67086,does nt this just translate into fewer places for poor people to buy food,7,
67087, 711 cashiers will now have to ring up cigarettes as organic kale instead of hot pockets,7,
67088,on the other hand  if the business stops taking food stamps entirely  not only can they not get the kale you want to make them eat  but they also ca nt get a loaf of bread or gallon of milk unless they start selling their food stamps to get cash to buy the milk and bread so the business still makes their money  the amount of food stamp fraud goes up  and the poor that you claim to be helping are getting even less food  healthy or otherwise  because of the food stampcash exchange rate,5,
67089,why are nt food stamps like wic  with wic you get vouchers for specific food items these items cover the basic food groups and align with a certain amount of nutritional value  meanwhile  you can buy friggin monster energy drinks with food stamps that makes no sense  regardless if you are looking at it from a healthy standpoint or a taxpayer standpoint,6,
67090,if obesity and other nutrition related issues are such a problem among the poor  would nt it be more cost effective to do away with food stamps and implement something like a food box program instead  in other words would the cost of labor to package and ship prepared food boxes in bulk to grocery stores and distribution centers be offset by what would be saved in reduced healthcare costs  imagine a program where you list the people in your household  any allergies or specific requirements and a box is prepared to supplement your family for a week it could contain things like rice  beans  canned or pouched goods like meats  vegetables and fruits  dried oatmeal and cereals  powdered milk  cooking oil every month they could receive a selection of 5 spices  salt and pepper and even a recipe pamphlet if in addition to the box  they started a program where grocery stores and produce growers could drop off older or bruised produce  people could pick some up for free when they picked up their boxes,7,
67091,what if the healthy foods do nt sell  are they still forced to stock them  would nt you think the actual grocers in the neighborhood would have a better sense of what their customers want than the federal government,4,
67092,no they ll stop or pack up and leave  ahhhincentives,4,
67093,you can lead them to water  but you ca nt make them drin,5,
67094,we have jackinthebox here in phoenix that has we accept ebt  signs up all over pisses me off  same thing at the gas station when you see children without any parents around loading up on overpriced candy and soda and  sure enough  out comes the ebt card or even worse is when they are  with  the adult and loading up on dog shit  food stamps should only be foractual food,3,
67095,honestly this will be great  the state  should  be very involved in what people eat for free,1,
67096,another  good intention  bad policy,1,
67097,this is the dark side of welfare  the constitution is completely circumvented the government has the power to cajole and pressure when it is putting stipulations on the money it gave out the government is capable of doing things it would never have the power of doing otherwise  like forcing a business to carry certain products  or forcing a person to apply for jobs or eventually  forcing people to work at government labor jobs,,
67098,because dontravious demands fresh cilantro,1,
67099,i wonder how much crime in a store would go down if the store was no longer food stamp approved,1,
67101,gt  90 percent of government revenues are from oil  70 percent of working saudis are employed by the government  and even the private sector remains heavily dependent on government spending  haha that about sums up the structural problem right there,8,

67105,i have spent some time among the government arab workers of these nations and i have no pity for the trials that lie ahead of them in the real world  they wielded their unearned wealth with a brash arrogance  putting themselves above other races with a disgusting assumption that they were somehow favored by god  and therefore inherently better than others in fact  it was equally distasteful for them when an american did  not  wield their racenationality with a pompous arrogance because this undermined their own claim to legitimacy  this was not some single unpleasant person i dealt with it was the overwhelming majority out of 100 citizens  there were maybe 5 people who had enough wisdom and openmindedness to question such an absurd world view  for example  on a hot day i was supervising pakistani and indian workers doing our manual labor for us  as it would have been unbecoming for an arab and an american to be doing manual labor i took some of our cold water bottles we had in our cooler and offered them to the workers  but was stopped by one of the head guys  do nt do that   he warned me shaking his head his message was clear  he did nt want the workers to get used to that treatment  i witnessed minorities berated and even physically accosted at times only americans and british were spared from the cruel racism that pervades the arab world it seeps into your daily life and if you live in it long enough you even start to internalize it ugh  i am looking forward to the cold splash of reality to wash over that region and wake many of those intolerant people up from their slumber,7,
67106,get ready for a lot of afluenza,7,
67107,saudis in general are incredibly lazy had 7 in my mis program every single one flunkedgot booted from their groups for overall laziness  ask any iraqmiddle eastern stationed vet what they think about saudi officers lazyapathetic  never had to earn anything,7,
67108,gt  our main issue is that our university did not prepare us for the job market  gt  they  d get out of university and get a government job now you need an advanced degree  til us millennials are not the only ones that got a kick in the pants by the generation before them  however  the saudis did get their education for free  edit  punctuatio,7,
67109,have done some research in saudi echoing similar things everybody wants government jobs  but the government is trying to push private sector employment  so you end up with many saudis who do nt do anything showing up on payrolls and there s a somewhat true perception that most companies would prefer to hire foreigners  who will work harder  over citizens  not sure what the longterm solution is for the employment problems  but crashing oil revenue is definitely going to make things worse will be interesting to see if government is going to start shrinking public sector employment more heavily,5,

67280,not really too much context given here  so it s hard to guess at the actual situation  but federal student loans  at least direct loans and the majority of those older loans passed back to fsa as they phased out the guarantee programs  do nt get sold to private collection agencies at this time maybe that part happened a while back  before current policies went into place and the collectors are taking advantage of the protections that federallyoriginated loans have  anyway  for people who are interested in learning more about how defaulted federal student loans are being collected today   check this out   https  wwwfbogovindex  s  opportunityamp  mode  formamp  id  216a8418f8e71f0c9c3475946ab100f8amp  tab  coreamp  _cview  1  they re currently in the middle of contracting new private collection agencies to service defaulted loans and you can see in the rfp documents how agencies are being scored and how that ties into account assignments  basically  for those who do nt feel like running through all of it  the big emphasis for student loan collections now is getting people through affordable rehabilitation options and into incomedriven repayment plans placements look like they re going to be based about 50  on careful regulatory compliance and borrower satisfaction surveys  which would make it extremely difficult for high pressure collections tactics to work out in the long run  none of that changes this story  just thought it was interesting in light of some of the comments i ve read that indicate people believe strongarm collection tactics for student loans will always be the norm  tldr  they re at least trying to throw a friendly paint job over the horribly broken federal student loan system these days,9,

67295,i knew this story was light on facts turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies  source   yahoo finance   https  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386html,5,
67296,gt  our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is nt the first and wo nt be the last  this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least,8,
67297,he was nt arrested for not paying his loan  he was arrested for not showing up in court  and the marshals did nt storm his house guns blazing they had guns  with them   like every other cop in the entire country,7,
67298,if you take money and have no plans on paying it back  it s called stealing,9,
67299,right the debt collectors just bought the debt  payed the filing fees to bring the case to court  threatened the man with their now official   pay us or else  and when he did not they used their settlement to have him arrested by the marshals nope  no government officers for hire here  just good old debt collection paid and serviced through the courts,5,
67300,til that most people have no understanding how the court system works  yes  civil attorneys can issue subpoenas  yes  a court can hold you in contempt if you fail to appear yes  a potential punishment for contempt is a bench warrant for your arrest  tl  dr  you can not simply ignore subpoenas you may go to jail,5,
67301,writing and publishing articles like this is dangerous the author offered a sensationalist angle on the  story  while leaving out key elements of why they were there in the first place ie missing court summons this is highly unethical and paints the federal government into a larger narrative that fox has been going for basically  rallying people by emotion not logic,6,
67302,this just in  there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government film at 1,5,
67303,student loans were made with certain assumptions about the future of the economy  both on the part of the schools  the tuition they charge   the lenders  and the student people should be required to pay their student loans but they should be adjusted downward  edit  this guy had a loan for  1500 measly bucks and did nt make any payments in 30 years  i would like to know if he was destitute  or just decided  fuck you everyone  i want to keep my money ,8,
67304,misleading title the marshals service will  arrest  you if you fail to show up for a court appearance you are not being tossed in jail  you are being hauled into court when you refused to answer a summons  from the article   paul aker says he was arrested at his home last week for a  1500 federal student loan he received in 1987  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  does anyone feel sorry for this man   1500  be serious,7,
67305,if i did nt pay back a federal loan for 29 years  i d kind of expect for there to be negative effects this dude did nt pay his loan  including when he was taken to court over it and received a judgment from the court specifically telling him to pay it if you ignore a court order  you re gon na have a bad time  i mean yes  the financial aid system needs to be fixed  but they re going after people who purposely are nt paying their loans which is a surprising amount of people  given how many refund chasers there are in the world for anyone else  there are programs like deferment options  sliding payscales  and whatever else along with loan forgiveness after 20 years  it s a shitty system  but this guy s case is not going to be the one to change it because he does nt deserve to have people dying on his hill for his particular cause,8,
67306,i m socialist and firmly believe that education and medical care should be paid for by federal government out of contributions that we make  however with that said  if you are contributing member of society you have to be a special kind of asshole not to repay  1500 loan over the period of 29 years no matter what was that loan used for,8,
67307,why is this news,5,
67308,dude got letters in his mail for months to pay and appear in court  this doesnt just come out of the blue he refused to show up to court multiple times thats a criminal offense,5,
67309,the revolution will not be subsidize,5,
67310,the whole student loan thing is a complete disaste,4,
67311,talk is cheap  between the intelligence agencies  an the lack of marijuana decriminalizatoinlegalizatoin  obama is nt that idfferent from previous administration,5,
67312,just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to the paper really is nt worth it otherwise college is becoming a joke anyways,5,
67313,every interaction i have ever had with navient  they have done everything they can to work with me  is your payment affordable  would you like a deferment  etc  i have had to take them up on that because of divorce not saying that is everyone s experience but they have nt been the loan sharks everyone else seems to act like they are just one man s experience though,5,
67316,hopefully the  awarenessraising  fraud that is the susan g komen foundation for the cure  will soon follow,8,
67317,in case you re wondering which was the worst charity in america  that would be the kids wish network  as identified in 2013 on this list  http  wwwtampabaycomamericasworstcharitie,7,
67318,not good enough you do nt let con artists off the hook if they  agree  to shut down the scam these people committed fraud and belong in jail,6,
67319,i do nt know how these people live with themselves,6,
67320,i wonder how long it will be until they open another one,3,
67321,sad that a majority of these are cancer related hopefully karma will catch up to them,3,
67322,i know it is a reach but why do these people need to make high salaries it is a charity you are supposed to be doing something good for other people if pay is needed then just like congress no more than 80k you are performing a service for people  10 of those charities involve the police the nickel tin mafia have their hands in all kinds of money making rackets,1,
67324,for those of you incapable of rtfa before making racist comments  the bride and groom are actors hired by a charity to raise awareness and the 37000day statistic refers to child marriages estimated worldwide not specifically in this local area,9,
67325,gt  nearly 15 million girls  some as young as eight or nine so  some as young as eight,9,
67326,37000 child marriages every day  if that s the case why are these people shocked  surely they must see these pedo photoshoots on the reg,8,
67327,these statistics seem unreliable estimated 12 billion new child marriages by 2050  even taking the 37000 a day estimate at face value that would only get you to 500 million by 2050  i mean seriously  assuming population growth rates remain unchanged  unlikely as the rate is slowing significantly  there will only be  47 billion women born under the age of 8 by 2050 is it truly believable that a quarter of women born in the next 34 years are going to be placed into a child marriage,8,
67328,ok this is a serious issue  but fuck the misleading clickbait title,8,
67329,paid to act and still goes for the hoverhand,4,
67330,as young as nine nine years old damn,4,
67331,i doubt half the people even read the article and thought the video was real they were actors and were stopped by plenty of people who called them criminals,6,
67332,i just wanted to point out the hand hove,1,
67333,where in lebanon was this  looks a bit like beirut if so  i can understand the mixed reactions i would wager the reactions would be less mixed in the northern or southern regions,1,
67334,i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country it s picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual some of them just do nt realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do,1,
67335,eh personally i m more concerned with men sitting with their legs spread on public transportation that s the real problem,1,
67336,at that rate the entire female population of the us would be married off in 11 years certainly 37000 child marriages a day is unsustainable or maybe it s media hype,1,
67337,the religion of peaceand pedophiliaand rapeand beheadingsand suicide bombingsand mass executions,,
67338,pakistan tried to pass a law banning child marriages and the clerics said   nope  the koran says as soon as a girl menstruates  she can be dtf whoever she s married to  so you re not allowed to pass a law like that  so they took it back and child marriage continues to be legal,,

67352,i lived 200yds from a burn pit when i was there in 04 i had some skin disease for about 2 years after iraq and some kind of asthma the va did nt give a shit then and they still do nt care  so  i got that goin for me,9,
67353,i was in tikrit  cob speicher  from 08 to 09 i lived a few hundred feet from the  burn pit  it was basically a huge junk yard with 3 huge constantly burning rectangular pits they were about 75 feet long and 50 feet across iirc you could see black or white smoke billowing from the area all the time i had to go there at least once a week to dump trash imagine standing over a red hot fire throwing junk off the back of a flatbed truck while it was 130 degrees outside sometimes the smog was so thick driving through the junk yard  that you could nt see 50 feet in front of you the smoke would almost always linger around the base and it smelled awful olfactory fatigue did not apply here it always smelled no matter how long you d be  exposed  you never got used to it never mind that they burned our shit right next door i remember one day we had to do a pt test the 2 mile run was on the same road as the burn pit smoke everywhere nobody passed that day some people were puking at the end i usually ran a 13  45 2 mile and i remember getting over 17 minutes i was gasping for air at the end we all thought the course was marked out incorrectly  but when we measured it later that day it was exactly 2 miles needless to say  nobody ever had any respiratory protection around these things  ever nor were we ever told we needed them i mean we had our gas masks in our gear  but nobody wanted to be  that guy  damn  we used to joke about it all the time whenever someone would start spewing some  war story   or when some freshoutabasic private would try to tell us about  that one time my drill sergeant made us do this  story   at the end we d say   yeah  but have you ever been to the burn pit    then we d laugh it off i guess it s not so funny anymore,8,
67354,my husband  half  jokes about the cancer he s going to get from the burn pits in afghanistan from what he described  they were horrible,8,
67355,this hits close to home we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight i really need to get this checked out,7,
67356,i can understand why burning trash and human waste may be unavoidable in certain military circumstances like in those remote outposts in afghanistan that might house 1520 people  there really are nt any good alternatives  however it seems less defensible to not have invested in better infrastructure once you had permanent bases the size of small cities  once you re at the point where soldiers had their own little airconditioned houses made out of cargo containers with air conditioning  satellite television  and onbase burger king it seems like you can probably invest in some proper trash incinerators instead of open burn pits,7,
67357,gt  though the us government disputes it well  color me surprised,8,
67358,a tsgt i know died recently from cancer he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family he was 32 his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer,7,
67359, support our troops with a ribbon sticker   that will definitely make up for all the fucked up shit the government puts them through,7,
67360,not surprised saw a guy in the va who used to jog through the base with his unitteam  not sure of the terminology   breathing in the smoke from one of these every day for 4 years he had some chronic lung condition we were working up  and said a couple of his buddies also have lung problems now otherwise perfectly healthy 40 years old  completely unnecessary illness due to stupidity andor apathy,6,
67361,http  wwwpublichealthvagovexposurescamplejeune for decades  the government knowingly allowed service members and their dependents to consume contaminated tap water fifteen diseases are recognized to have a direct relation to the contamination but many more are cropping up yet the government wo nt recognize those  yet   and they re filing motions to have claims tossed out based on statute of limitations  even though the government did nt even announce the contamination until over a decade after the wells were closed  this is nt just an agent orange or iraq war contamination where soldiers were exposed and have problems babies born at the base hospital hadhave an alarmingly high rate of birth defects but nothing is being done about it and the va continues to deny claims we ll just go ahead and add this one to the list,6,
67362,uhh i ve had a severe cough for 34 years now  since coming back from afghanistan  it ll get so bad  that i ll cough until i throw up  and then cough more  the va said it was normal i m sure they know what they re talking about i feel fine,6,
67363,i remember having to sit through a 2 hour briefing the first week i arrived in iraq  back in 2008 we were told that scientists verified that the burn pit on base was not a detriment to our health  then we had to sign forms when i returned stateside  there were quite a few reports of people having respiratory issues after returning from deployment  the va also denied that any illnesses were related to desert storm it took a long time for anyone other than veterans to admit that desert storm syndrome was a real thing  and then said veterans had to go through the gauntlet of proving their illnesses were related to their deployment,6,
67364,goddamn  it s unbelievable the way vets are treated shame,6,
67365,government does nt give a fuck about veterans,6,
67366,my 36yo buddy was just diagnosed with nonhodgkens lymphoma when he visited the va to do the paperwork they asked what bases he served at overseas  and literally had a list of diseases to reference per base just got a  yep  here it is probably from the burn pit  from the clerk thumbing down the list when he told me i was blown away  why is nt there any followup with soldiers who served at these bases    even a simple  you may want to get screened  when he returned from service would have given us some hope of getting in front of it it s incredibly irritating,6,
67367,the us lying about iraq and afghanistan  nah  never happen,7,
67368,do nt worry guys we ll take care of your medical needs when you come home oh wait,5,
67369,do nt forget area 51 they had burn pits like you would nt believe stealth materiels that had top secret components in them the poor guys that were exposed to all of this could nt even go for help  many died in secrecy  i know i was exposed to vaporized depleted uranium and who knows what else i have a sort of bet with my self that i ll die an early death,5,
67370,so  the dod did nt learn any lessons from previous burn pits  i mean  when you have to declassify area 51 because of workers health decline due to burn pits  you d think you d remember this shit is wrong,5,
67371, though he returned home safely in september 2009  he woke up one day a few months later with an inexplicable headache  numbness in his limbs and paralysis on one side of his body beau had suffered a mild stroke his health deteriorated  and he was diagnosed with brain cancer less than two years later  he died at the age of 46  holy fuck    fuck wars and politicians that start them,5,

67376,holy shit  my friend who was on the poop burning detail a bunch of times died of throat cancer earlier this year my first thought was it was the poop burning that did it  and i m concerned as well because i did my fair share of that as well,4,
67377,where we lived there was a burn pit that was nearby and the smoke would always float over to where we were  as of yet i dont have any symptoms but i do have a begine growth in my head  i have had it checked but i am paranoid that it could become bad ,4,
67378,little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did nt have to bother to actually lob chemicalbio weapons at us we d send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chembio bomb themselves  did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney,4,

67434,interesting though   since 2005  texas has prosecuted 38 juveniles for intoxication manslaughter or intoxication assault only three were sent to the adult system  and half of all cases resulted in probation of some kind  i think this is more telling of the justice system  and accessibility to competent  quality counsel it s clear money buys better legal counsel  but if the government subsidized public defense more heavily  the outcomes would clearly be different,9,
67435,cash is king in the world of corruption,9,
67436,i said this somwhere else  but it s also pertinent here  everyone is equal under the law and money is how we measure that equality,9,
67437,the difference  money,9,
67438,it s almost like the rich live under different rules,8,
67439,this is standard practice in the us judicial system outcomes will vary from case to case depending on financial status there s actually a legal term for it  it s called   cream ,9,

67443,i love how this article just glosses over the fact that arellano had previous dui convictions which is why he did nt receive the same sentence  this was couch s first dui case which is why he got probation  as texas takes the rehab route  but whatever lets rage and ignore the fact,8,
67444,is everyone here honestly  seriously shocked that money gets you out of trouble  am i taking crazy pills,5,
67445,going beyond the dae legal system is corrupt  circlejerk in this thread  there are certainly some differences in these cases firstly  the arellano case  the other one in the article  happened in 2007  six years before couch s trial likewise  the article says that arellano had driven while intoxicated and drank underage before  which means that he would ve had a greater chance of being moved to an adult trial meanwhile  couch had no prior violations of the law  meaning that he could nt be moved to an adult court,7,
67446,i understand what you are trying to do with your anecdotal case comparisons however  they are nt comparable cases when you consider all the factors  including criminal history  but  even if you ignore all the other factors  i know of a white 20 yo male from a fairly wealthy family in my area who was sent to prison for a year based on a drunk driving accident so my anecdotal evidence shows similar punishment to your anecdotal case thereby anecdotally refuting your point,8,
67447,the real crime here those eyebrow,6,
67448,gee  it s almost like different judges and prosecutors in different areas with separate cases can lead to different verdicts or something,7,
67449,that s why the case became famous because he got away while guilty that was autocorrect capitalization,4,
67450,affluenza is just a fake term that means the following  if you are rich  you do nt go to jail if you are not  you will spend 10 years like 95  of americans,4,
67451,let s be clear what happened to the poor kid was what s supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone you fucking go to prison couch was the exception,7,
67452,he did nt go free he was on probation and then he violated that  so he s going to jail,8,
67453,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,3,

67460,horrible headline  38 cases of dui manslaughter in texas since 2005 and only 3 of them went to adult court  that tells you the vast majority of these cases are handled with kid glovesso picking out one of 3 that went the other route and comparing it to the affluenza case is disingenuous  but fuck it  that is what the media does today god forbid they instead do an article focusing on how in texas if you are a drunk driving kid that kills people you will get away with it 35 out of 38 time,4,
67461,it did nt seem to mention how they had the same judge  we ve already established this same judge would have been open to giving a similar sentence to a poor minority because she tried to do just that keep making this a race issue  though lord knows the media loves to stir up ignorant poor folks  also  anyone who comes to the us illegally and kills is citizens deserves little sympathy he was a juvenile  so it would be appropriate to release him and deport him  i do nt understand the need to distort issues to make tbem about race we already have enough problems it s already an established fact that those with the means to afford a lawyer fair better than those who do nt,3,
67462,the difference  money,1,
67463,did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window,1,

67468,cash rules everything around me they have  and very good lawyers,1,
67469,well  on one hand you have a kid that killed 3 adults and a child in a crash  and on the other a kid who killed a mother and her  unborn child  in a crash in a conservative state so he could have mowed down 10 born people and probably got less than what he gets for  accidentally  killing 1 unborn baby,1,
67470,free public defender vs 2000  an hour lawyer,1,
67471,this affluenza thing still baffles me  doing bad things because money  with that sort of logic hobos must be saints and not the crack heads living under bridges,1,
67472,no shit  i mean was nt the entire outrage that similar cases normally lead to prison in the first place,1,
67473,seriously  the rich kid,1,
67474,that s what  affluenza  means literally the entire point of this case and why it s been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich,1,
67475,i say it like my grandma used to  money talks  bullshit walks,1,
67476,he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows wtf,1,

67496,not as bad as actual slaves that work in unpaid internships,5,
67497,well  when the tpp goes through we ll all get to enjoy such working conditions  the fact of the matter is that this occurs constantly  the authorities refuse to investigate and the workers lack the leverage to bring the employers to court,1,

67514,not only did they assault a veteran with a deadly weapon  they used his credit cards at locations should nt be too tough to find them fuck these kids,8,
67515,this is a pretty typical mugging the mugger aggressively asks you a question  and regardless of your answer they either beat you or ask for money sometimes it s shit like  do you care about the homeless   and if you say  yes  then they aggressively ask for money and if you say no they get upset and threaten you and say you are a liar if you say no  they threaten to beat you or they just get violent either way  you are going to end up giving them your walletmoney another common one is asking you for a cigarette if you do nt have any  they will accuse you of having one and not giving it to them because of some stupid reason  racism  greed  etc  and then get aggressive and demand money for a pack of cigarettes whenif you pull out your wallet they will just grab it and walk away or beat you and run  i was on a bus and had a guy ask for my cell phone to make a call  when i said no  he said i was a racist because i assumed he was going to steal it made a big scene and stood up and got in my face and started slapping my head until i gave him the phone then he got off the bus  same principle with this happens all the fucking time if they get caught they usually say shit like  oh he gave it to me  i did nt steal it  scumbags only reason this one made the news is because it was a war vet,9,
67516,pieces of shit who ve done nothing but take from societ,8,
67517,i hope that the assailants rot in prison,7,
67518,from the daily caller article  gt   i believe this was a hate crime and i was targeted because of my skin color   marquez told the dcnf  too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the main stream media refuses to report on it  woah there racist  only black people can be the victim of a hate crime  now take your beating and shut the hell up about these underprivileged disadvantaged teen youths,8,
67519,i m sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case,8,
67520,lock these shitheads up and throw away the ke,8,
67521,black lives do matter these teens  lives  however do not,9,
67522,every fucking time a cop shoots a black guy  justified or not  we have people like obama telling us we have to do some  soul searching  and when cities like dc and baltimore  i live around both and can personally attest that shit like this happens all the time and is usually never reported  and detroit and new york and such have this shit happen  it s a non issue  fuck all of it  trump 201,8,
67523,do white lives matter to blacks,5,
67524,i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold  it s really political blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims  and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws  and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm  how much power do the sjws really have  will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution,8,
67525,and people try to tell me that what celebrities do and say is not important at all on some level  in some instances it is  this is the movement beyonc  tried to shove into everyone s face at the superbowl just remember that,8,

67528, do black lives matter if you do nt agree we ll beat and rob you   and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement,8,
67529,i would like to remind everyone that bernie sanders has aligned himself with and defended the black lives matter movement in many of his speeches he talks about sandra bland  michael brown  eric garner and in typical fashion blames racism and the white establishment sanders never once mentions the blacks that are home invading in indianapolis  kansas city  atlanta  etc he never once talks about the blacks that have shot at and killed police  most recently a 19 year old black man shoots an officer in mississippi black lives matter and politicians like sanders are waging that the future will be less white and in that future you folks can imagine who will be the most vile and racist  edit  from today  white house tweets shoutout to grammy winner of best rap album  still no word on recent spate of cop killing,9,
67530,let s see if this gets labeled as the hate crime it very clearly is  who am i kidding  that wo nt happen,8,

67551,tl  dr  apple has to provide the means to extract encrypted data from the device fbi will then try to decrypt it  i assume by brute force  would would be easy for a 4digit pin   the interesting part is that the device is owned by farook s employer  the san bernardino county department of public health had they been following proper device protocol  they would already have administrator access to it  this was literally government property used for terrorism  and now unsearchable not due to the  encryption  boogeyman but their own ineptitude,7,
67552,gt  the judge ruled tuesday that the cupertinobased company had to provide  reasonable technical assistance  to the government in recovering data from the iphone 5c  including bypassing the autoerase function and allowing investigators to submit an unlimited number of passwords in their attempts to unlock the phone apple has five days to respond to the court if it believes that compliance would be  unreasonably burdensome  so it sounds like the government does nt think apple can bypass it for them  just make it easier for them to brute force i bet judge s ruling will hold up  too,4,
67553,apple  you are hereby ordered to factor the following data into its prime numbers  or be found in contempt,1,

67567,at least the article refers to this as a rape  rather than a  relationship  or  incident  like lots of others do,8,

67600,i have my own super secret private social network site that only i know about,6,
67601,so  i read the article and it appears the site was not created by anonymous but anonymous advocates the site  i believe facebook could use some healthy competition  though i question how private anyone s information can be on the internet  even with encryption it seems no matter how much you try to protect someone s information online  there is always someone who  with enough time and ingenuity  can obtain it,5,
67602,anyone else get the feeling this was an ad,4,
67603, doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  i have watched criminal minds penelope can do it,6,
67604,given the propensity of anonymous for leaking confidential and private information of people who do nt share their viewpoints  i do nt know how super private it would stay if someone expressed a contrary opinion would my belief that kanye is an immature narcissist result in release of the name and location of my virginity loss  or my 2nd grade teacher  btw  not the same person ,6,
67605,i bet tom from facebook is already a membe,3,
67606,gt  but unlike its competitors it doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  so how does it make money to pay for development  management  support  bandwidth  and servers  i do nt know how this shit gets reported slow news day  remember that stupid  social network  diaspora  they got global coverage about their facebook alternative i do nt think they ever even finished the product  let alone had anyone use it  must be built by the son of some important news editor who can drum up publicity this is likely the same,5,

67620,the entitlement attitude of so many americans  gt  if it was me  i would have probably escorted this procession to the burial  your funeral escort was driving without a valid license the chp was correct to pull him over and cite him the rest of the funeral procession was free to continue on but you chose to pull over instead that was your own decision that caused you to be late the funeral  what is so aggravating to me about this is the family will file a lawsuit and probably win they will get to think they are right but they will milk the taxpayers of thousands of dollars,1,

67644,from the regressive left s perspective  by censoring and silencing opposing opinions  especially those from sources merely  perceived  as not being   progressive   regressive enough  they are allowing for  traditionally oppressed groups  to   be used as a mouthpiece that ca nt be challenged because of cries of racism   speak  just as long as they say the correct    progressive   regressive things ,,

67649,the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison,6,

67669,another  holographic storage  for us to hear about for 20 years that wo nt materialize in our lifetimes it s a bummer  removable archival media seems like it is really stagnant,6,
67670,yes  but will there be a  reader  for that disc in 14 billion years,6,
67671,i always love when brand new technologies claim forever,4,
67672,cool  take all of humankind  audio  video and written text  and burn it to a couple of discs store several copies of it on the moon  along with a radio beacon should humanity get wiped out  we ll have left something for future generations to discover  no need to build giant pyramids,4,
67673,wish someone would actually do thi,1,
67674,they ll be used as tiddly winks by some kids who dig them up billions of years from now,1,
67675,quartz  why do we have to code it onto quartz  i m pretty sure i saw them somewhere record an mp3 file onto water,,
67676,when can i buy a burner  i have to move onto my next project  archiving the world s vast array of porn,,
67679, every  prepackaged shredded cheese has it it s the most common anticlumping agent used around the world the argument is that the labels said 100  cheese,9,
67680,labels should be accurate end of story if the product inside does not match the label ingredients  it is fraud and should be prosecuted as such,8,
67681,that s why you buy a little wedge of parm and use a microplane grater on it to shave cheese onto your pasta the wedge lasts a very long time  and in the end it s cheaper than the nasty jars,7,
67682,cellulose is the actual substance you ll find it in all pregrated cheeses these guys were just busted putting too much in to save    lettuce is also made of cellulose where commercial outfits get it for cheese  i guess could be just about any plant judged edible  including  sure  trees  also who knows what kind of cheese you re supposedly getting much nicer to get a hunk of the real stuff and a crank grater  my knuckles hate box graters with a passion ,8,
67683,so my penne has wood,8,
67684,so the correct labeling is 92  cheese and 8  wood filler  i think that s right,6,
67685,solution  buy your parmesan  domestic or real  and grate it yourself tastes better too if you re really lazy  grate it and freeze until you need it,7,
67686,damn were becoming like china  next will have faked food,5,
67687,what kind of wood   are we talking the high quality organic stuff  or factory processed scrap wood  because goddamnit if they ve been slipping cheap wood shavings into my welfarecheese  we re going to have an fucking issue on our hands,4,
67688,lol  wood it is cellulose trying to get clicks,6,
67689,i m safe  source  only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti,3,
67690,i shred my own parmesan cheese  it makes worlds differenc,3,
67691,this is why i do nt buy nasty sargento cheese ever taste it  it tastes like wood  i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better,3,
67692,hmm i am pretty sure i misread that title,1,
67693,it s cheaper by the chunk anyways,1,
67694,similar to olive oil  most parmesan cheese is nt even parmesan cheese,1,
67695,my parents always called it cardboard chees,1,
67696,it still taste oh so goooooooood,1,
67697,if it tastes good  i do nt care,1,
67698,pene means weiner in spanish that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood,1,
67699,maybe they are just trying to get people to eat a whole door over the course of a year,1,
67700,just buy the blockwedge and grate your own,1,
67701,gt  she faces up to a year in prison  so  what re you in for blondie    just beat me up and get it over with,1,
67702,cellulose is indeed an anti clumping agent if they use more and it does not change taste  i am ok with it at least it has less calories  ,,
67703,if you buy preshredded or grated cheese  you deserve to eat wood,,
67705,funny how employers get to steal from employees  and if they are caught  they simply have to repay the employee what they are owed nobody gets charged  nobody goes to jail  meanwhile  if an employee steals from an employer  they get charged  fined  and probably spend some time in jail ditto for customers who steal  i wonder why people hate the government and rich people,8,
67706,hopefully australia has a similar thing to the usa where prisoners are paid like 47 cents per day,6,
67707,not as bad as actual slaves that work in unpaid internships,5,
67708,well  when the tpp goes through we ll all get to enjoy such working conditions  the fact of the matter is that this occurs constantly  the authorities refuse to investigate and the workers lack the leverage to bring the employers to court,1,
67709,here in the us the government would go after ahmed and not see an issue with what was going on monetarily  edit  some of you really need to step away from the computer and not take this place so seriously,,
67710,seriously why are we  the usa  importing workers on visas to work at 711s,,
67712,yes please too big to fail means they are too big  period break them apart,8,
67713,this seems like a no brainer not saying it will be easy  but why ever have banks too large to fail even exist,9,
67714,absolutely agree  but it will likely go nowhere it really is nt any different than when the government stepped in and broke up atamp  t into the baby bells unfortunately  this is talk by those who have no power to enforce change,6,
67715,seems like a good move if you re too big to fail  you are clearly in violation of antitrust and monopoly legislation  surely  plus  anything that is too big to fail is clearly just a bad idea from the standpoint of a societies ability to sustain unexpected shocks and surprises,7,
67716,big banks and wall street bank elections for both parties not going to happen unless supreme court reverses  citizens united  ruling allowing corporations to donate unlimited amount of funds to politicians and political parties as long as such bribery is legal  no politician will bite the hand that feeds himher,5,
67717,this is a political talking point floated to make sanders look like an over reactor if andor when he loses the nomination this guy and his idea will disappear from sight,6,
67718,hopefully  his floating that idea wo nt end up with him floating in the river,4,
67719,kashkari  eh  so  how does goldman sachs make money off of this,4,
67720,eh  wake me when they actually start breaking them up for now this is just more idle talk,4,
67721,i guess they could nt find a picture that makes him look crazier,4,
67722,if there are any economists here  i have a question how do we know that this wo nt have the same results as breaking up telecoms  regional monopolies collude until one is more successful and one starts to fail the successful one buys the failing one then this process repeats until the most successful one is enormous again  but with writeoffs  layoffs and debts thanks to the less successful ones consumers get screwed by footing the bill for the whole failed experiment  if telecoms can do that  why would we assume that banks wo nt just do the same thing  to the effect of even more pain for consumers,4,
67723,oh hey  it s the guy who ran for california governor,3,
67724,news update  spontaneous fires erupt in rome,3,
67725,no if we break up banks or make them have more capital  they will invest less  and folks on reddit will say its too hard to get a loan the banks will now actually want to make sure folks can actually pay back the loan  and a lot of folks have no assets  and will cry its not fair   only the rich are getting the loans    since they already have assets   are you sure you want to hold banks accountable  personally  i think its a great idea  but not sure you all realize the banks will just push that accountability back on you,3,
67726,that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money,1,
67727,probably not that big of a problem anymore they ve plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 20 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become,1,
67728,looks as though he s beginning a political career as a goldman  fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him asshole,1,
67729,breaking up huge banks reduces the chance that banks will get the giant bailouts the did after 2008 failures  massive corporate welfare they will lobby hard against the potential loss of a free ride,1,
67730,godless commie socialism yes pleas,1,
67731, flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca nt fail  did anyone else see this   wtf  so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further,1,
67732,trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it,1,
67733,from my armchair  i d say that the entire banking sector needs to be deleveraged 301 leverage  or whatever it currently is  is too much slowly  over time  to prevent shocks from the deleveraging   deleverage the banks  and it would make it harder for a crisis to become systemic,1,
67734,kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying,1,
67735,kashkari was part of the paulson team that leveraged the american banking empire into toobigtofail and now that that leverage is proving to be dangerous for the survival of the one per cent kleptocrats he wants to break up the tbtf banks  geithner knew this would manifest when he used tbtf as a stopgap measure to save the synagogue of satan worshiping kleptocracy of fraudsters that run the federal reserve now that same kleptocracy wants to be bailed out once again because geithner s temporary solution has run it s course straight into the gutter where geithner amp  kashkari et al  belong  up yours  america the functional retard,,
67736,this has been happening for a while now  i came to japan in 2005 for university  graduated in 2009  and i m still here i ca nt imagine ever moving back to usa life is so much better here  which i ve had a really hard time admitting until recently my fellow americans  get out if you re not appreciated there s literally a whole world out there ready to give you opportunities,9,
67738,gt  90 percent of government revenues are from oil  70 percent of working saudis are employed by the government  and even the private sector remains heavily dependent on government spending  haha that about sums up the structural problem right there,8,
67739,maybe they could rent themselves out as maids to rich philippinos,8,
67740, my grandfather rode a camel  my father rode a camel  i drive a mercedes  my son drives a land rover  his son will drive a land rover  but his son will ride a camel,8,
67741,disaffected youth gon na be disaffected,8,
67742,i have spent some time among the government arab workers of these nations and i have no pity for the trials that lie ahead of them in the real world  they wielded their unearned wealth with a brash arrogance  putting themselves above other races with a disgusting assumption that they were somehow favored by god  and therefore inherently better than others in fact  it was equally distasteful for them when an american did  not  wield their racenationality with a pompous arrogance because this undermined their own claim to legitimacy  this was not some single unpleasant person i dealt with it was the overwhelming majority out of 100 citizens  there were maybe 5 people who had enough wisdom and openmindedness to question such an absurd world view  for example  on a hot day i was supervising pakistani and indian workers doing our manual labor for us  as it would have been unbecoming for an arab and an american to be doing manual labor i took some of our cold water bottles we had in our cooler and offered them to the workers  but was stopped by one of the head guys  do nt do that   he warned me shaking his head his message was clear  he did nt want the workers to get used to that treatment  i witnessed minorities berated and even physically accosted at times only americans and british were spared from the cruel racism that pervades the arab world it seeps into your daily life and if you live in it long enough you even start to internalize it ugh  i am looking forward to the cold splash of reality to wash over that region and wake many of those intolerant people up from their slumber,7,
67743,get ready for a lot of afluenza,7,
67744,saudis in general are incredibly lazy had 7 in my mis program every single one flunkedgot booted from their groups for overall laziness  ask any iraqmiddle eastern stationed vet what they think about saudi officers lazyapathetic  never had to earn anything,7,
67745,gt  our main issue is that our university did not prepare us for the job market  gt  they  d get out of university and get a government job now you need an advanced degree  til us millennials are not the only ones that got a kick in the pants by the generation before them  however  the saudis did get their education for free  edit  punctuatio,7,
67746,have done some research in saudi echoing similar things everybody wants government jobs  but the government is trying to push private sector employment  so you end up with many saudis who do nt do anything showing up on payrolls and there s a somewhat true perception that most companies would prefer to hire foreigners  who will work harder  over citizens  not sure what the longterm solution is for the employment problems  but crashing oil revenue is definitely going to make things worse will be interesting to see if government is going to start shrinking public sector employment more heavily,5,
67747,syriana is a really good movie  imo,5,
67748, what about us braindead slobs ,4,
67749,could nt happen to a nicer group of religious authoritarians,5,
67750,i m sure this will turn out well for regional stability,3,
67751,this reminds me of gundam 00 s setting  where fossil fuels have become depleted and the world moved on to better and more efficient sources of energy  which resulted in countries overly reliant on oil exports plunging into poverty,1,
67752,sounds like us in alberta  canada,1,
67753,there is place for cockroaches but not too many  it s like a big pile of garbages enabled a small tribe to explored into a hoards,1,
67755,if the proposal came from a doctor or scientist  i would be 100  on the side of this bill but it comes from a senator  which makes me want to question it  scientific papers require peer review from the most qualified people to call bullshit on an idea before you can get it published as legitimate i m not saying i m questioning the idea  but i do nt know enough about the process of bills and laws to give it my automatic seal of approval  i think it s a good idea to administer anesthesia to an unborn human that can feel pain whether or not it increases the cost of abortion but the cost is still a talking point all i can do is hope that the people in charge of the decision in the end have the same concerns that i do,8,
67756,i mean  we already use anesthesia on fetuses when performing surgery in the womb for exactly this reason  so it s hardly surprising  http  wwwdoctorsonfetalpaincomfetalpaintheevidence5documentatio,7,
67757,wether a fetus is under anesthesia is completely dependent on the type of anesthetic being performed any general anesthetic also anesthetizes the fetus while other types like spinal or local do not even then  there is no accurate way to quantify or measure awareness in fetuses  much less adults undergoing anesthesia the body also still responds to pain under anesthesia  as its an autonomic response  so the definition of  feeling pain  is not something that should be measured i feel like awareness  which is impossible to measure in a fetus regardless  is a real idicator of humanity an easy solution would be to simply do all elective abortions under general anesthesia  which may cost more  but is easily doable i have no idea what the preferred method of anesthesia is  if any  for elective abortions  source  i do anesthesia in a catholic hospital,5,
67758,i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them,7,
67759,they have nt decided at what point of gestation this would happen  gt  montana lawmakers passed a similar law in 2015 requiring fetal anesthesia before surgeries  including abortion  after 20 or more gestational weeks  so  4 months the general consensus for viability outside the womb is around 6 monthsish for some the concept of consciousness coincides with viability outside the womb,6,
67760, this is a review on fetal pain   http  jamajamanetworkcomarticleaspx  articleid  201429amp  resultclick  1  from clinical review  although it is 10 years old it says  gt  evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques similarly  limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion,5,
67761,is nt this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor s office  would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder,4,
67762,i m going to talk about this as delicately as possible i  genuinely  want thoughts and opinions on this subject  i am asking that no one become immediately offended by what i m about to say rather than respond with your opinion telling me why you believe that my view should change i am childfree i do nt want kids  i m 35  so it s pretty much set in stone at this juncture in my life i do nt see myself as a prolife or prochoice supporter and the reason for that is because i kind of agree with both sides on one hand i firmly believe that the destruction of a human being  born or not  is murder it fits the definition  of  murder before you downvote me into oblivion  let me be clear it s not the votes i care about it s that you understand where i m coming from even though i have that belief  i also believe that some people were just not meant to be children but therein lies another debate  why do nt they place it in adoption  because most of the time unwanted children are kept  they re not placed into adoption and when they re kept their chances of being neglected as children  whether it be mentally  emotionally  or physically  rise exponentially i certainly would nt want to have a child and resent it i  do nt  have children because frankly i m mean as a damn snake i do nt see any part of me that could ever have a child and not lose my temper with it and i would nt put a kid through that  because  i  was put through that i would be a horrible parent  anyway  i have a point i swear if you re going to have an abortion  why anesthetize it first  do i believe that it can feel  absolutely  but you re killing it i mean it s not like you re putting it to sleep and saying   here  fight for your life  you re fucking killing it so why have a crisis of conscience about it  again  i m sorry if i offend anyone  that s not my intention i m just a realistic person and it is what it is sugarcoating it does nt change it the bill seems like a waste of time and tax dollars  edit  i do nt understand why this is being downvoted so  please  give me your views instead of leaving me wondering because if there s something i m not understanding it needs to be made clear again this is absolutely not about the votes rather than having a discussion,,
67763,ignorant people propose bill based on said ignorance,,
67764,if you pinch a fetus it will cry so that pretty much proves they feel pai,,
67765,because that makes it okay  smh,,
67769,i hope they get it right and protest the us department of education if student loans are your issue  go straight to the source of your ills ironically enough  the only way to end student debt is to scale down and eventually eliminate the student loan program,7,
67770, protesters lose jobs for not showing up to work  arrested for nonpayment,7,
67771,i see payday loans taking this route soon,4,
67772,did nt we get rid of debtor s prisons  i m confuse,4,
67773,i believe this happened as i heard this story from other news sources  but some info had to be left out or missing in the us if you owe money on a debt the personcompany has seven years to collect if they do nt the debt disappears if they take you to court and get a judgement they have ten years to collect and it can be renewed for ten more years the only way he could be arrested is if the loan company took him to court  won a judgement and then took further action to force the debtor to court this would not be something to come out of the blue,4,
67774,more from the professional  victim class  i guess you need something to do in between police shootings and sanders rallies,5,

67781, impaled  sounds about as much of an overstatement as  got a splinter  would be an understatement in this case,7,
67782,gt   i  ve got a tournament here in two weeks  and i have every belief that we  ll be playing on this court that as well   hibner said  or you could put your petty shit on the backburner and ensure the safety of kids by paying for a structural analysis,3,

67809,so this guy is innocent until proven guilty right  why is this investigation so short  we do nt know the details  why does it take a year to investigate an officer for shooting someone  and this takes a couple of days to charge this guy  is that disconnect enough to make anyone here question things enough to accept that there is a massive encompassing problem with our legal system  i always have to wonder because we see many of the same people calling for people to wait for details after an officer shoots someone  telling us not to be monday morning quarterbacks then stories like this pop up and we have those same people frothing at the mouth in this situation where it has nt been given the year plus of investigation that an officer who shoots someone would be given the guy is already guilty despite the cries to give officers the benefit of the doubt because of the innocent until proven principle,,

67826,if a telephone company has this large a problem  they have to meet with the fcc and show cause most likely there would also be a hefty fine but  not cable networks because they are deemed nonessential,7,
67827,not news to me i have a 3 hour outage at least once a month with comcast a 1020 minute outage daily around 56 am  and at least 34 10 minute outages sprinkled throughout the week  i know this because 2 out of every 5 or 6 dvr recorded shows are fucked up during the middle   absolutely awful i live in a moderate city  too  so it s not like i m in the middle of fucking nowhere,7,
67828,and then they wonder why people are ready to go to google fibe,7,
67829,loss of internet and television access for 3 days would cause mass panic and riot,8,
67830,my bad people i went over my 300gb and used way too much of an infinite resource,7,
67831,wow  17k outages nationwide for as much as 3 hours  obama needs to step in and fix this for sure ,9,
67832,gt  across us i bet i could find thousands who are angry at comcast  in my town alone ,5,
67833,i m fully expecting to get downvoted to hell here  but what the heck  i m not particularly fond of comcast  but unless i missed something here  which is entirely possible   this does nt actually sound like it was particularly horrific for people in general it sounds like a very small fraction of their nationwide customer base  had an outage of parts of their service for about 3 or 4 hours  not even all of their service  but things like they could nt access their hd channels  or their internet did nt work for a few hours  i understand for businesses  an internet outage can be a big deal  so some outrage on their part would be justified  but for the general consumer  come on  get a grip go read a book for a while  or go outside for a bit  or  gasp  go do something with your family  i m just not getting what the huge deal was here  what am i missing,7,
67834,i was part of the outage did nt have internet and only had access to about 8 sd channels i ll be honest  3 hours where i have to use my phone for internetsi could nt care less had to go out and shovel anyway  edit  couldgt  could n,7,
67835,not a fan of comcast  but with this outage they probably still provide 9999  uptime bunch of whiners  yes  i work in it,6,
67836,i like how this is news in this country,7,
67837,comcast angers me even without outages,7,
67838,the words  anger  and  comcast  come up often,4,
67839,there needs to be legally mandated uptime and speed requirements  95  of the time your connection must reach the  advertised  speed  no more  up to xmbps  allowed  and 99  of the time it must reach 14 of that speed if this is nt met then customers must be completely refunded for that month,4,
67840,is anyone else still completely fucking down  just everything  been down for 15 hours here,4,
67841,quote from the article   comcast has more than 27 million customers  and 89000 of those are new cable subscribers the company signed on last quarter that was its best performance in eight years  correct me if i m wrong but are nt there 2 choices for most people  sign up with comcast or do nt have high speed internet  it s like bragging because people choose to eat food from the only supplier rather than starve to death,4,
67842,comcast seems to be an isp that people love to hate  charter got so bad for so many years that i loved to hate them in all honesty  the past three to four years or so they have been great,7,
67843,customer service replied   working as intended,3,
67844,i ve had comcast xfinity for almost 2 years now and i ve never had an issue,5,
67845,fun story i was at a friend s place watching the superbowl in denver comcast blacked out cbs with 1 minute 26 seconds left on the clock in second quarter  and service was nt restored till about 15 seconds before 3rd quarter kicked off  idk how widespread this was but lots of denverites did nt get to see the super bowl halftime show i d imagine comcast would lose a lot of money if their advertisers paid to have a certain amount of views and one of the biggest markets  since denver was participating in the super bowl  cut out all views during the entire halftime show idk how their whole contract with that stuff goes though  i hear i did nt miss much though,4,
67846,that s what happens things go out sometimes,3,
67847,friend of mine called to ask why he couldnt connect  he obviously cant check if there are outages in his neighborhood without the internet  he calls them and they offer to send a tech to his house for like  80  they didnt tell him the price  but you know itd be up there  he spends an hour checking all his connections  digging through paperwork to find his modem settings page  finally calls back about 8hrs later hoping to talk to someone else and theyre like   oh yeah  there s an outage in your area   idiots,4,
67848,when i called  i was disconnected 3 times this is great customer nonservice beside the lack of tv thanks comcast for helping me make my change from you  easier,1,
67849,it s nothing new that comcast absolutely sucks,1,
67850,when you deal with technology  there is only one thing i can guarantee you it will get down at the worst possible time,1,
67851, compact angers thousands across the us for something other than just being comcast for once  ftf,1,
67852,they just put a data cap on my home internet how fucked is that  pretty fucked if you ask me,1,
67853,what is the most troubling about comcast is that when there is an outtage  it doesnt effect just a small region  but instead downs multiple states that seems so rediculous,1,
67854,once they fix the outage you re left with  comcast anger thousands across us,1,
67855,now only 1000 years to lrrr ruler of the planet omicron persei 8 comes to destroy earth,1,
67856,it s not like we re losing  that  much more bandwidth it s only like 20 megs less than what we had before which was only 80 megs less than what we re paying for,1,
67857,so  i had to get comcast recently because i moved and noticed something weird about my bill the letter in the mail has a different due date than the due date that shows up on the online account just saying folks make sure to pay 2 days before your date at least,1,
67858,just having comcast in general makes them angry,1,
67859, nsfw how comcast really feels   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  kmcny_pixdw,1,
67860,once in a while fios is out for a few hours hard to get too pissed  these things do happen i do nt think comcast needs an outage to be hated honestly though for me they were a decent provider  i never had a single issue with them except for the occasional outage,1,
67861,wow now that s comcastic,1,
67862,it was out for like 3 hours jesus christ,1,
67863,my comcast service  for the first time in years  has actually been pretty good lately but i d like to pay less  so i m rooting for google fiber to come to boston simply so i can reap the benefits of competition  i mean  that s what we really want  right  we do nt want yet another monopoly  no matter how  altruistic  we think google will be  we want the existing monopolies to be forced into providing quality service for a reasonable price  along with other choices,1,
67864,it probably still worked better than my centurylink ds,1,
67865,comcast s response   it pays the restoration fee  or else it gets the hose again,1,
67866,my case  as in many others  boils down to this  you can pay triple the amount for the same throughput speeds or you can curse comcast and wait for google fiber,1,
67867,at the same time  i would nt want to be on the other end and get screamed at from 10k  people experiencing the outage i just went out instead of being at home it s aggregating that it happens so often  at the same time there are other things to d,1,
67868,they should just switch providers if they are nt satisfied  see what i did there ,1,
67869,after this comcast will just be turning off their services everywhere after all  they could save a ton of money that way,1,
67870,spread your cheeks  most of you wo nt even complain or ask for a billing credit,1,
67871,title should just be  comcast angers thousands across us   i fucking hate comcast with every fiber of my being  reasons  i  paying top dollar for slow as shit internet  ii  a modemrouter combo that broadcasts an unsecured public network from your home which has to be manually deactivated  iib  said modem has to be forced reset once a week  and doing so undoes the manual changes you made to get rid of the second network  iii  arbitrary data caps  iv  live television that freezes  v  ondemand that works infrequently  and turns into minecraft porn when it crashes  vi  customer  service  that refuses to listen to what your problem is  but instead tries to upsell you on a more advanced package  one of my dreams is to live long enough to see this shit stain regional monoploy of a company implode upon itself  or be run straight into the fucking grave by google fiber,1,
67872,i always laugh at this shit until i remember i m with twc  the   second   worst rated isp in america,1,

67878,good luck is nt that the entire shrimp industry,3,
67879,why was nt this a law like 80 years ago ,1,
67880,even if it s not perfect or entirely enforceable yet  it s a first and important step in doing the right thing,1,
67881,i live in a small fishing town and sometimes the price they get for their fish is equivalent to slave labor,1,
67882,all goods from slave labor,1,

67887,til that the plot for the movie hostel is honestly very probable,1,
67888,my initial reaction was  what the fucking fuck     but on second thought  assisted suicide would be a reasonable motive old people with terminal diseases should nt be forced to live out their last few months or years in suffering if they do nt want to,,

67899,little south of fresno and was outside and my neighbor came running out  did you feel that  so we ran and looked at my pool and the water was moving  pretty cool to see that,1,
67900,the big one is near and there is reason to fear,1,
67901,who cares oklahoma had a 51 the other day and it was nt even anything to write home about,,
67902,i moved away from california at the end of december this helps reinforce my decision as a good idea,,
67904,from  government  s memorandum in support of its motion for pretrial detention   http  wwwscribdcomdoc29947153421616doc4usavclivenbundyusadetentionmemorandumforclivenbundy  gt  bundy is lawless and violent he does not recognize federal courts  claiming they are illegitimate  does not recognize federal law  refuses to obey federal court orders  has already used force and violence against federal law enforcement officers while they were enforcing federal court orders  nearly causing catastrophic loss of life or injury to others he has pledged to do so again in the future to keep federal law enforcement officers from enforcing the law against him as of the date of this hearing  he continues to violate federal court orders and continues to possess the proceeds of his illegal activities  gt  gt  bundy is currently charged with crimes of violence including using and brandishing firearms in connection with crimes of violence under title 18  united states code  section 924  c   as such  the bail reform act presumes that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that will ensure the safety of the community 18 usc  3142  e   3   b   here  no evidence has been adduced during the investigation of the instant charges that even remotely hints at a rebuttal to that presumption in fact  all the evidence suggests that bundy will continue to act lawlessly  will not abide by court orders  and will use violence to ensure that federal laws are not enforced as to him,8,
67905, bundy asked for a courtappointed attorney at his first hearing last week  still living off govt handouts i see,8,
67906,gt  bundy   his  attorney said  would go to court in nevada if ordered to do so   right  sure i mean  it s not like he s ever defied the government before  and he  totally  recognises it s legitimacy  gt  but judge stewart said if bundy was released   i  m guessing that  s the last we  ll ever see of mr bundy  a wise and perspicacious judge,9,
67907, daughterinlaw briana bundy said tuesday that a federal judge in oregon should let the 69yearold live at home while he awaits trial  sure that s an excellent suggestion i would further suggest that the judge prepare a lunch of peanut butter sandwiches with home made raspberry jam and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies for mr bundy each day,8,
67908,gt  the judge said bundy  69  is a flight risk and a danger to the community in the bail hearing tuesday afternoon in downtown portland i mean i ca nt really find a reason not to agree with that a 69 year old who does nt believe he s beholden to the law is as dangerous as a 29 year old who does nt believe he s beholden to the law,8,
67909,they are just misunderstood they did this for free sex toys,8,
67910,not sure he was the worst member of ya llquaida  http  mwashingtontimescomnews2014apr15formersheriffwillingletwifedaughterdiefron,5,
67911,hope he gets the  negros  there to hear his theory or their culture and living style,1,
67912,the man is a wellmeaning but ideologically obsessed idiot the government has handled this clusterfuck extremely well  and i am not one to say that lightly,6,
67913,it s important for the government to provide a consistent and cohesive narrative if they are to help squash future acts of rebellion cliven bundy and his ilk are lawless  violent  redneck anarchists and none of the things they protested had any validity whatsoever,1,
67914,good  this arrest and trial has been delayed for too long,7,
67915,given his history  bundy is as dangerous as a monkey with a straightrazor,4,
67916,where is the groundswell of the righteously indignant right wing militia that was supposed to come to his aid,1,
67917,mmmmmm i need some of the bundy range fed beef i hope the feds seize it all soon and put it up for sale,1,
67918,so anyone knows how long a trial like this could last,1,
67919,yalqueda finally facing justice,1,
67920,well then that s that,1,
67921,does this mean that harry reid s son s land deal can finally go through,,
67923,fucking sad how this was nt described as an act of terrorism i guess that title is reserved for nonchristians,9,
67924,it is sad that it closed even for a short time people like fiorina do nt give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time,8,
67925,definitely not terrorism though  just a little rampage  you know he was probably having a bad day or something,8,
67926,good for them  dont let those freedom hating assholes scare you away from your job,8,
67927,how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him,4,
67928,is carly out of the race yet  i do nt think that rightwing  fringe conartist is done riling up her terrorist sect,7,
67929,deadly rampage  was  terrorist attack  a little too onthenose,7,
67930,why does this headline say  deadly rampage  and not  christian terrorism ,5,
67931,now i m not a fan of abortions but who the hell can think to themselves i know how to stop babies from being aborted  i ll just shoot all the moms and their doctors  absolute lunatic,1,
67932,thank god its back open now we can get back to crushing fetus  heads and sucking their brains out like normal people,,
67933,on president s day   the gaul,,
67934,so  someone went on a shooting rampage and killed people in order to stop planned parenthood from killing people  but now planned parenthood is open again  and proudly killing people  well  i am glad that worked out the entire thing makes tons of sense,,
67935,pp is where there is regular deadly rampages against unborn babies,,
67936,planned parenthood is basically condoms and the oklahoma city bombing,,
67938,for those of you incapable of rtfa before making racist comments  the bride and groom are actors hired by a charity to raise awareness and the 37000day statistic refers to child marriages estimated worldwide not specifically in this local area,9,
67939,gt  nearly 15 million girls  some as young as eight or nine so  some as young as eight,9,
67940,37000 child marriages every day  if that s the case why are these people shocked  surely they must see these pedo photoshoots on the reg,8,
67941,these statistics seem unreliable estimated 12 billion new child marriages by 2050  even taking the 37000 a day estimate at face value that would only get you to 500 million by 2050  i mean seriously  assuming population growth rates remain unchanged  unlikely as the rate is slowing significantly  there will only be  47 billion women born under the age of 8 by 2050 is it truly believable that a quarter of women born in the next 34 years are going to be placed into a child marriage,8,
67942,ok this is a serious issue  but fuck the misleading clickbait title,8,
67943,paid to act and still goes for the hoverhand,4,
67944,as young as nine nine years old damn,4,
67945,i doubt half the people even read the article and thought the video was real they were actors and were stopped by plenty of people who called them criminals,6,
67946,i just wanted to point out the hand hove,1,
67947,where in lebanon was this  looks a bit like beirut if so  i can understand the mixed reactions i would wager the reactions would be less mixed in the northern or southern regions,1,
67948,i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country it s picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual some of them just do nt realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do,1,
67949,eh personally i m more concerned with men sitting with their legs spread on public transportation that s the real problem,1,
67950,at that rate the entire female population of the us would be married off in 11 years certainly 37000 child marriages a day is unsustainable or maybe it s media hype,1,
67951,the religion of peaceand pedophiliaand rapeand beheadingsand suicide bombingsand mass executions,,
67952,pakistan tried to pass a law banning child marriages and the clerics said   nope  the koran says as soon as a girl menstruates  she can be dtf whoever she s married to  so you re not allowed to pass a law like that  so they took it back and child marriage continues to be legal,,
67953,woody allen is dating again,,
67954,what wrong with this prophet mohammad had sex with a nine year old child  prophet is perfect do nt be blinded by secularism  thats what an apologist would say and its true the prophet liked them youn,,

67958,are these the people you want flooding your country on a daily basis  are these the kinds of values that america will benefit from importing,,
67959,lol this is nt normal in lebanon and that is clear from the video these people are actor,,
67960,its funny how the muslims in the video oppose this even though the greatest man that has ever lived  mohammed  has actually married a child around that age,,
67961,honestly what s the big deal this is a tradition going back thousands of years why stop it now,,
67962,someone post this on rfeminism and see where that fuse leads too i would but i been banned for positing stuff that does nt fit the narrativ,,
67963,i thought this was child to child marriage   still fucked up but at least that s not as bad as this,,
67964,once a girl has her period  nature has decided she can be a parent or a bride that s a hard fact for most to swallow nature gives no shits about how our culture has changed,,
67969,gt  gt  johnson says the man s family will be shown body camera footage of the incident before it s released publicly  well  that s an improvement,6,
67970,personally working as security guard in a hospital  and having to deal with people who have mental health issues its not fun  or safe and generally the actual hospital staff is nt very helpful i ve been kicked in the head  punched in the face  and many other things happen sometimes these people can not be handled and tazeing could deescalate the situation,4,
67971,from what i ve read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops it looks like the taser use was justified sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca nt be deescalated otherwise  has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died,7,
67972,this is unacceptable tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are nt,7,
67973,he died 5 days later at a different hospital  clickbait headline i m sure we ll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death,6,
67974,well at least the officers saved the victim from harming  himself ,4,
67975,he died a week later he was also resisting arrest,3,
67976,officers ca nt subdue people without shocking them to deathstun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only not some wack trying to get mental help,,
67977,oh this is lame  his identity has not been released  nor the race of the officers   wtf does that have to do with anything  oh that s right more race bating by the media,1,
67978,police are to trigger happy they could easily have uses theiroh,1,
67979,the article states he was attacking staff and police using glass vials the police were not obliged to wrestle this violent person and risk getting stabbed by broken glass it s pretty simple  do nt violently attack innocent people and you wo nt be tased,,
67980,police are not there  to protect and serve  you  edit   warren v district of columbia   https  enwikipediaorgwikiwarren_v_district_of_columbia  is just one example that downvoters should read,,
67983,meanwhile  the cat yawned and continued to wash its face,5,
67984,could nt find it in the article  but wonder the breed of the dog not that it matters kudos to dogs ,1,
67986,the government issued 15 billion euros of sixyear notes to yield 198 percent  gt  and 1 billion euros of 15year bonds with a 342 percent yield  the finance ministry said in an emailed statement,3,
67987,anyone else surprised at the extremely low interest rates for mexican bonds  i would of thought that their borrowing costs was more in line with other developing countries,1,
67989,yes please too big to fail means they are too big  period break them apart,8,
67990,this seems like a no brainer not saying it will be easy  but why ever have banks too large to fail even exist,9,
67991,absolutely agree  but it will likely go nowhere it really is nt any different than when the government stepped in and broke up atamp  t into the baby bells unfortunately  this is talk by those who have no power to enforce change,6,
67992,seems like a good move if you re too big to fail  you are clearly in violation of antitrust and monopoly legislation  surely  plus  anything that is too big to fail is clearly just a bad idea from the standpoint of a societies ability to sustain unexpected shocks and surprises,7,
67993,big banks and wall street bank elections for both parties not going to happen unless supreme court reverses  citizens united  ruling allowing corporations to donate unlimited amount of funds to politicians and political parties as long as such bribery is legal  no politician will bite the hand that feeds himher,5,
67994,this is a political talking point floated to make sanders look like an over reactor if andor when he loses the nomination this guy and his idea will disappear from sight,6,
67995,hopefully  his floating that idea wo nt end up with him floating in the river,4,
67996,kashkari  eh  so  how does goldman sachs make money off of this,4,
67997,eh  wake me when they actually start breaking them up for now this is just more idle talk,4,
67998,i guess they could nt find a picture that makes him look crazier,4,
67999,if there are any economists here  i have a question how do we know that this wo nt have the same results as breaking up telecoms  regional monopolies collude until one is more successful and one starts to fail the successful one buys the failing one then this process repeats until the most successful one is enormous again  but with writeoffs  layoffs and debts thanks to the less successful ones consumers get screwed by footing the bill for the whole failed experiment  if telecoms can do that  why would we assume that banks wo nt just do the same thing  to the effect of even more pain for consumers,4,
68000,oh hey  it s the guy who ran for california governor,3,
68001,news update  spontaneous fires erupt in rome,3,
68002,no if we break up banks or make them have more capital  they will invest less  and folks on reddit will say its too hard to get a loan the banks will now actually want to make sure folks can actually pay back the loan  and a lot of folks have no assets  and will cry its not fair   only the rich are getting the loans    since they already have assets   are you sure you want to hold banks accountable  personally  i think its a great idea  but not sure you all realize the banks will just push that accountability back on you,3,
68003,that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money,1,
68004,probably not that big of a problem anymore they ve plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 20 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become,1,
68005,looks as though he s beginning a political career as a goldman  fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him asshole,1,
68006,breaking up huge banks reduces the chance that banks will get the giant bailouts the did after 2008 failures  massive corporate welfare they will lobby hard against the potential loss of a free ride,1,
68007,godless commie socialism yes pleas,1,
68008, flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca nt fail  did anyone else see this   wtf  so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further,1,
68009,trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it,1,
68010,from my armchair  i d say that the entire banking sector needs to be deleveraged 301 leverage  or whatever it currently is  is too much slowly  over time  to prevent shocks from the deleveraging   deleverage the banks  and it would make it harder for a crisis to become systemic,1,
68011,kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying,1,
68012,kashkari was part of the paulson team that leveraged the american banking empire into toobigtofail and now that that leverage is proving to be dangerous for the survival of the one per cent kleptocrats he wants to break up the tbtf banks  geithner knew this would manifest when he used tbtf as a stopgap measure to save the synagogue of satan worshiping kleptocracy of fraudsters that run the federal reserve now that same kleptocracy wants to be bailed out once again because geithner s temporary solution has run it s course straight into the gutter where geithner amp  kashkari et al  belong  up yours  america the functional retard,,
68014,i lived 200yds from a burn pit when i was there in 04 i had some skin disease for about 2 years after iraq and some kind of asthma the va did nt give a shit then and they still do nt care  so  i got that goin for me,9,
68015,i was in tikrit  cob speicher  from 08 to 09 i lived a few hundred feet from the  burn pit  it was basically a huge junk yard with 3 huge constantly burning rectangular pits they were about 75 feet long and 50 feet across iirc you could see black or white smoke billowing from the area all the time i had to go there at least once a week to dump trash imagine standing over a red hot fire throwing junk off the back of a flatbed truck while it was 130 degrees outside sometimes the smog was so thick driving through the junk yard  that you could nt see 50 feet in front of you the smoke would almost always linger around the base and it smelled awful olfactory fatigue did not apply here it always smelled no matter how long you d be  exposed  you never got used to it never mind that they burned our shit right next door i remember one day we had to do a pt test the 2 mile run was on the same road as the burn pit smoke everywhere nobody passed that day some people were puking at the end i usually ran a 13  45 2 mile and i remember getting over 17 minutes i was gasping for air at the end we all thought the course was marked out incorrectly  but when we measured it later that day it was exactly 2 miles needless to say  nobody ever had any respiratory protection around these things  ever nor were we ever told we needed them i mean we had our gas masks in our gear  but nobody wanted to be  that guy  damn  we used to joke about it all the time whenever someone would start spewing some  war story   or when some freshoutabasic private would try to tell us about  that one time my drill sergeant made us do this  story   at the end we d say   yeah  but have you ever been to the burn pit    then we d laugh it off i guess it s not so funny anymore,8,
68016,my husband  half  jokes about the cancer he s going to get from the burn pits in afghanistan from what he described  they were horrible,8,
68017,this hits close to home we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight i really need to get this checked out,7,
68018,i can understand why burning trash and human waste may be unavoidable in certain military circumstances like in those remote outposts in afghanistan that might house 1520 people  there really are nt any good alternatives  however it seems less defensible to not have invested in better infrastructure once you had permanent bases the size of small cities  once you re at the point where soldiers had their own little airconditioned houses made out of cargo containers with air conditioning  satellite television  and onbase burger king it seems like you can probably invest in some proper trash incinerators instead of open burn pits,7,
68019,gt  though the us government disputes it well  color me surprised,8,
68020,a tsgt i know died recently from cancer he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family he was 32 his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer,7,
68021, support our troops with a ribbon sticker   that will definitely make up for all the fucked up shit the government puts them through,7,
68022,not surprised saw a guy in the va who used to jog through the base with his unitteam  not sure of the terminology   breathing in the smoke from one of these every day for 4 years he had some chronic lung condition we were working up  and said a couple of his buddies also have lung problems now otherwise perfectly healthy 40 years old  completely unnecessary illness due to stupidity andor apathy,6,
68023,http  wwwpublichealthvagovexposurescamplejeune for decades  the government knowingly allowed service members and their dependents to consume contaminated tap water fifteen diseases are recognized to have a direct relation to the contamination but many more are cropping up yet the government wo nt recognize those  yet   and they re filing motions to have claims tossed out based on statute of limitations  even though the government did nt even announce the contamination until over a decade after the wells were closed  this is nt just an agent orange or iraq war contamination where soldiers were exposed and have problems babies born at the base hospital hadhave an alarmingly high rate of birth defects but nothing is being done about it and the va continues to deny claims we ll just go ahead and add this one to the list,6,
68024,uhh i ve had a severe cough for 34 years now  since coming back from afghanistan  it ll get so bad  that i ll cough until i throw up  and then cough more  the va said it was normal i m sure they know what they re talking about i feel fine,6,
68025,i remember having to sit through a 2 hour briefing the first week i arrived in iraq  back in 2008 we were told that scientists verified that the burn pit on base was not a detriment to our health  then we had to sign forms when i returned stateside  there were quite a few reports of people having respiratory issues after returning from deployment  the va also denied that any illnesses were related to desert storm it took a long time for anyone other than veterans to admit that desert storm syndrome was a real thing  and then said veterans had to go through the gauntlet of proving their illnesses were related to their deployment,6,
68026,goddamn  it s unbelievable the way vets are treated shame,6,
68027,government does nt give a fuck about veterans,6,
68028,my 36yo buddy was just diagnosed with nonhodgkens lymphoma when he visited the va to do the paperwork they asked what bases he served at overseas  and literally had a list of diseases to reference per base just got a  yep  here it is probably from the burn pit  from the clerk thumbing down the list when he told me i was blown away  why is nt there any followup with soldiers who served at these bases    even a simple  you may want to get screened  when he returned from service would have given us some hope of getting in front of it it s incredibly irritating,6,
68029,the us lying about iraq and afghanistan  nah  never happen,7,
68030,do nt worry guys we ll take care of your medical needs when you come home oh wait,5,
68031,do nt forget area 51 they had burn pits like you would nt believe stealth materiels that had top secret components in them the poor guys that were exposed to all of this could nt even go for help  many died in secrecy  i know i was exposed to vaporized depleted uranium and who knows what else i have a sort of bet with my self that i ll die an early death,5,
68032,so  the dod did nt learn any lessons from previous burn pits  i mean  when you have to declassify area 51 because of workers health decline due to burn pits  you d think you d remember this shit is wrong,5,
68033, though he returned home safely in september 2009  he woke up one day a few months later with an inexplicable headache  numbness in his limbs and paralysis on one side of his body beau had suffered a mild stroke his health deteriorated  and he was diagnosed with brain cancer less than two years later  he died at the age of 46  holy fuck    fuck wars and politicians that start them,5,
68034,the us govt so cares about its troops,7,
68035,i ve known military to have permanent letters added to their medical records saying they have been exposed to the worst man made hazarddisaster since chernobyl,4,
68036,does kaf still have the shit pond  on another note  im going to have this checked out the va has this on their website somewhere  they sent an email,4,
68037,there are so many things wrong with this i do nt even know what to say  let s just purposefully burn hazardous material  petroleum products  chemicals  and batteries next to our camp oh  and throw some explosives in there while you re at it and vaporizes all that shit so we can breath it in are you kidding me,4,
68038,holy shit  my friend who was on the poop burning detail a bunch of times died of throat cancer earlier this year my first thought was it was the poop burning that did it  and i m concerned as well because i did my fair share of that as well,4,
68039,where we lived there was a burn pit that was nearby and the smoke would always float over to where we were  as of yet i dont have any symptoms but i do have a begine growth in my head  i have had it checked but i am paranoid that it could become bad ,4,
68040,little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did nt have to bother to actually lob chemicalbio weapons at us we d send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chembio bomb themselves  did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney,4,
68041,every time i allow myself a shred of regret for not enlisting  i remind myself that this kind of shit is what the us does to its soldiers fuck that i respect your service and all that  but fuck that shit,1,
68042,every goddamn war the military has to do something that exposes troops to dangerous chemicals,3,
68043,makes me wonder  i was at camp addertallil back in 2010  2011  what was i exposed to,3,
68044,i was in taji in 2011 2 people got cancer after our deployment  lots of people were having breathing problems we were right next to the tank graveyard and the burn pit was constantly going in our rush to shut down theater i ve gotten lung infections every year since then,3,

68064,the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though,9,
68065,it should be interesting to see how she s ruled in cases of dui in the past,9,
68066,she refused a breathalyzer meh she ll beat thi,9,
68067,would nt being drunk compromise her ability to judge  how many times has she been impaired while working  should nt anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least  what should i make for dinner,9,
68068,offitherrrr i am the la,9,
68069,no one has mentioned this yet but she got pulled over at 8 am drinking in the morning  this judge has some problems,9,
68070,rochesterian here the article failed to mention that she was also driving with 2 flat tires for who knows how long,8,
68071,in fairness  if i was a judge in rochester i d need a few drinks before work too,9,

68077,what seems to be the officer  problem,6,
68078,well who s gon na judge the case now,5,
68079,her judgement was impaire,6,
68080,fry needs to weigh in here  http  imgurcomgvji0u,5,
68081,to be clear  the fact that she refused a breathalyzer is important in many states it is treated as evidence of impairment and justification for arrest she knew that i have many friends who are criminal defense attorneys and all have told me they advise to refuse breathalyzer always  unless there is a court order  i m not familiar with ny law  but i can pretty much guarantee she will not be convicted of dui if middle classcollege kids can get out of them  a federal judge surely can since it said nothing about a field sobriety test  i assume they either did nt administer one  or they did and she did not meet criteria for impairment,5,
68082,my friends mom is a judge and that lady boozes super hard and will drive her car around i have seen her come home from the bar completely in ruins at least a dozen times over the last 10 years she is fearless  we live in a small town in wisconsin with a huge police presence she knows all the officers and has never had an issue the whole situation seems completely ridiculous she gives out sentences for dui all day and then drives drunk all night oh god  the hypocrisy,5,
68083,ny state troopers only care about the star program more tixarrest  promotionmoney so if they could get points on there own mother they would,5,
68084,i m just amazed that our local news channel in lafayette is on the front page of reddit x,5,
68085,regardless of judge plates  why shouldare judges treated any differently  if i expect to get pulled over and ticketed for 5mph over i believe a judge should too especially since they make 15 times the income,5,
68086,i feel like poor judgement like this should make you not a judge anymore,5,
68087,oh they decided the law applies today,5,
68088,many  if not most  political figures are serious alcoholics when you combine the constant parties and  fundraisers  that they are expected to attend with the stress of the job  a lot of them end up drinking a lot,8,

68100,they use wood pulp for all sorts of shit  years back i learned that orange juice pulp was actually tree pulp  fuck that i never drank orange juice with pulp ever again ,1,
68101,gt  castle made shoddy cheeses for almost 30 years   gt  the company actually filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after a fired factory worker ratted the company out to the fda   a  i m amused that the cheese company was  ratted  out  b  30 years   i guess this guys  annual review did nt go well   i want a 35  raise or imma gon na rat you out    you go ahead bob ai nt nobody gon na believe you   c  i have nt been making chicken parmesan all these years  i m ok with chicken cheddar but i ca nt show up at a potluck with chicken wood pulp,1,

68106,well shit i just read a til like last week about him still being alive,1,
68107,his fatal mistake was using that old refrigerator to play hide and seek,1,
68111,can you tell florida house that please ,1,
68113,interesting though   since 2005  texas has prosecuted 38 juveniles for intoxication manslaughter or intoxication assault only three were sent to the adult system  and half of all cases resulted in probation of some kind  i think this is more telling of the justice system  and accessibility to competent  quality counsel it s clear money buys better legal counsel  but if the government subsidized public defense more heavily  the outcomes would clearly be different,9,
68114,cash is king in the world of corruption,9,
68115,i said this somwhere else  but it s also pertinent here  everyone is equal under the law and money is how we measure that equality,9,
68116,the difference  money,9,
68117,it s almost like the rich live under different rules,8,
68118,this is standard practice in the us judicial system outcomes will vary from case to case depending on financial status there s actually a legal term for it  it s called   cream ,9,
68119,my mom has always said guilty until proven rich,8,
68120,i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law this is the american dream,7,
68121,and liberty and justice for all  who can afford it ,5,
68122,i love how this article just glosses over the fact that arellano had previous dui convictions which is why he did nt receive the same sentence  this was couch s first dui case which is why he got probation  as texas takes the rehab route  but whatever lets rage and ignore the fact,8,
68123,is everyone here honestly  seriously shocked that money gets you out of trouble  am i taking crazy pills,5,
68124,going beyond the dae legal system is corrupt  circlejerk in this thread  there are certainly some differences in these cases firstly  the arellano case  the other one in the article  happened in 2007  six years before couch s trial likewise  the article says that arellano had driven while intoxicated and drank underage before  which means that he would ve had a greater chance of being moved to an adult trial meanwhile  couch had no prior violations of the law  meaning that he could nt be moved to an adult court,7,
68125,i understand what you are trying to do with your anecdotal case comparisons however  they are nt comparable cases when you consider all the factors  including criminal history  but  even if you ignore all the other factors  i know of a white 20 yo male from a fairly wealthy family in my area who was sent to prison for a year based on a drunk driving accident so my anecdotal evidence shows similar punishment to your anecdotal case thereby anecdotally refuting your point,8,
68126,the real crime here those eyebrow,6,
68127,gee  it s almost like different judges and prosecutors in different areas with separate cases can lead to different verdicts or something,7,
68128,that s why the case became famous because he got away while guilty that was autocorrect capitalization,4,
68129,affluenza is just a fake term that means the following  if you are rich  you do nt go to jail if you are not  you will spend 10 years like 95  of americans,4,
68130,let s be clear what happened to the poor kid was what s supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone you fucking go to prison couch was the exception,7,
68131,he did nt go free he was on probation and then he violated that  so he s going to jail,8,
68132,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,3,
68133,if someone is brought up too rich to not know the difference between right and wrong  why can the same argument not be used for poor people who commit crimes  people who are brought up in poverty do nt really know right from wrong just as much as a kid who has rich parents,3,
68134,that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time,3,
68135,  sees title   probably not a rich white kid   clicks article   and yuuuuuuuuuup sm,3,
68136,prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win,3,
68137,obviously as white god intended,3,
68138,i fucking hate ethan couch  i mean look at that look on his face disgusting i mean even his name is stupid,6,
68139,horrible headline  38 cases of dui manslaughter in texas since 2005 and only 3 of them went to adult court  that tells you the vast majority of these cases are handled with kid glovesso picking out one of 3 that went the other route and comparing it to the affluenza case is disingenuous  but fuck it  that is what the media does today god forbid they instead do an article focusing on how in texas if you are a drunk driving kid that kills people you will get away with it 35 out of 38 time,4,
68140,it did nt seem to mention how they had the same judge  we ve already established this same judge would have been open to giving a similar sentence to a poor minority because she tried to do just that keep making this a race issue  though lord knows the media loves to stir up ignorant poor folks  also  anyone who comes to the us illegally and kills is citizens deserves little sympathy he was a juvenile  so it would be appropriate to release him and deport him  i do nt understand the need to distort issues to make tbem about race we already have enough problems it s already an established fact that those with the means to afford a lawyer fair better than those who do nt,3,
68141,the difference  money,1,
68142,did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window,1,
68143,by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time,1,
68144,excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did,1,
68145,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,1,
68146,lemmeguess ethnic  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they re ethnic,1,
68147,cash rules everything around me they have  and very good lawyers,1,
68148,well  on one hand you have a kid that killed 3 adults and a child in a crash  and on the other a kid who killed a mother and her  unborn child  in a crash in a conservative state so he could have mowed down 10 born people and probably got less than what he gets for  accidentally  killing 1 unborn baby,1,
68149,free public defender vs 2000  an hour lawyer,1,
68150,this affluenza thing still baffles me  doing bad things because money  with that sort of logic hobos must be saints and not the crack heads living under bridges,1,
68151,no shit  i mean was nt the entire outrage that similar cases normally lead to prison in the first place,1,
68152,seriously  the rich kid,1,
68153,that s what  affluenza  means literally the entire point of this case and why it s been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich,1,
68154,i say it like my grandma used to  money talks  bullshit walks,1,
68155,he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows wtf,1,
68156,there s actually a legal question that you asked,1,
68157,you do nt automatically get a dui in fact,1,

68164,gt  purchase orders showing that the sheriff s office spent more than  60000 on barbecue grills wtf why,9,
68165,this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties the docs and comments on the forum board are searing i would imagine many itinformation systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments,8,
68166,i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever,8,
68167,cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification  one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry,5,
68168,they re public officials and public servants  appointedhiredelected we re entitled to see what these records are  without exception,8,
68169,as much as i m for police transparency  i m not for their home addresses being out there that puts their families and neighbors at risk,8,
68170,i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered,8,
68171,anything worth even looking at in this release,3,
68172,do nt know why they re concerned  surely they have nothing to hide ,5,
68173,if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear,1,
68174,good anytime somebody s falsely charged with shit their life is dragged through the mud in the papers  let the pigs have the same,,
68175,you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings,1,
68176,notice that hackers never dox the 01   billionaires sponsoring hillary clinton  etc,1,
68177,you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced  well fuck it no more police and no more rules    fucking stupid juveniles,,
68178,umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops there s hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops,,
68181,also cars bad guys use those a lot and the internet also food,9,
68182,casinos would lobby against it a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small it would fit in a plastic shopping bag a million dollars in small bills is massive  there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash,8,
68183,how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 ,9,
68184,yeah if my big illegal bag of money was heavier  i d totally reconsider all the crime i do to obtain large bags of money it just would nt be worth the hassle,7,
68185,thank you but fuck no it s bad enough carrying around 100s to go buy cars amp  bikes on craigslist  now you want me to carry boxes of 20s   the  100 has plenty of legitimate uses  no need to make things harder for the 999  of the population that s lawabiding,9,
68186,thats why they got rid of the  500 billand it didnt work so well,8,
68187,keep marijuana and cocaine illegal  it s the 100 dollar bills that are the problem,7,
68188,i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four  5000 bills instead of two  10000 was too taxing better go straight,8,
68189,clearly  100 bills are the problem,7,
68190,people still listen to larry summers  i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008 or does cnn still think repealing glasssteagall was a good idea,7,
68191,it s not about stopping criminals it s about controlling peoples money with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically this is what done in europe to prevent  tax fraud ,7,
68192,might aswell remove any chemicals or equipment in the world that can make drugs aswell larry summers idea is stupid  it would nt just hurt criminals  it would hurt the innocent people aswell,7,
68193,in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the  100 bill it is very popular outside the us,5,
68194,the new blue  100 bills are too cool to replace,5,
68195,80  of the money supply being in  100 bills is the key statement this would likely be the first  and easiest  step to killing paper currency this is one of the initial hurdles to overcome  because they do nt give a fuck about it being tough on criminals  come on  when looking to implement negative interest rates,8,
68196,the thing about secondary labor markets  drugs  gambling  prostitution  etc  is that prohibition is what causes the main problems related to them these are black markets that will always have demand as long as the activities are forced underground by punitive policy  and that demand will always find a way around obstacles  making life marginally more difficult for the suppliers is only doing to make the products more dangerous  not less desirable,4,
68197,that is the most twisted logic   no more  100 bills  guess i ll stop dealing crack,5,
68198,okay larry last time we listened to you we deregulated the banks in 1999 nah larry  i m not gon na listen to you,5,
68199,make it illegal for poor people to ever have cash money so that you can freeze their accounts when their name shows up on the noflylist  eh  they already ca nt buy a car in cash without the dealership informing on them to the feds,6,
68200,how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds   ,4,
68201,i urge everybody here to watch inside job  it will shock you on how thoroughly corrupt this dude is  along with his buddies on wall street washington now he wants the gov to ban the  100 because of nirp  he does nt give a fuck about criminals using those or tax evasions do not listen to what this turd says,4,
68202,i wonder what larry would think about paul krugman s onetime pet project  the  trilliondollar coin   http  krugmanblogsnytimescom20130107bereadytomintthatcoin  _r  0 ,5,
68203,is something going on with all the major currencies  i saw a similar story about the euro notes too  http  wwwdailymailcoukwiresreutersarticle3448066ecbconsidersscrapping500euronotehtml also http  wwwdailymailcouknewsarticle3437590banksurgedban50notesbidendcashhandculturehelprecoupbillionstaxtreasuryhtml all these stories within a week of each other  i would nt be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency,3,
68204,currently in colorado  hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash,3,
68205,scrap larry summers  and get rid of a criminal,3,
68206,the only relevance to crime is the idea itself scam to grab more control of your money  bankster shenanigans do nt fall for it,3,
68207,the banks love this this means less people holding cash and more money that they can use to fuck us over remember folks  the rules are changing so that the money on deposit with banks is legally not yours if there s a bank failure  your money will be used to bail out the banks  the move is simply an extension of the war on cash,3,
68208,the fed stopped printing any bills higher than  100 in 1945 they began destroying the larger denominations actively in 1969  100 in 1945 is equivalent to  1300 today adjusting for inflation frankly they should be talking about issuing a  200 and  500 bill  if not also a  1000 bill,3,
68209,larry summers should be in prison  he is one of the architects of the 2008 collapse he also was instrumental in the repeal of glasssteagall the world would be better off without this fool and his dangerous ideas  http  wwwsourcewatchorgindexphp  title  larry_summer,3,
68210,does larry mean wall st criminals  of course not  white male entitlement it s what larry is all about unfortunately obama was dumb enough to bring summers into his administration where he flailed about  lamely attempting to cover upmake excuses as to why the theater burned down in 2008 with the financial  masters of the universe  still inside  larry proved his overall dumbness by predicting 2011 would be  recovery summer   based on nothing  no evidence just his  expert  opinion  there was no recovery in 2011,3,
68211,bring back the  500 and  1000 dollar bills dammit,3,
68212,larry summers  ladies and gentlemen one of the masterminds of financial deregulation is now proposing another hair brained idea summers  go clone yourself so you can go fuck yourself,3,
68213,attention  we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash  except pennies   cash is privacy and should be a basic right,1,
68214,just legalize crime everybody wins,4,
68215,fuk this illuminati puppe,3,
68216,the bulk of the value of cash in circulation is from  100 s get rid of cash and the fed can do any crazy policy it wants this is a necessary step towards negative interest rates nobody believes the government gives two shits about money laundering  florida real estate laws and hsbc getting zero criminal charges shows that is not the case,4,
68217,banksters do nt even use cash oh wait you re talking about the little criminals carry on,5,
68218,another attempt by the wealthy to outlaw cash our money is nt our money  according to the elite,5,
68219,then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination ,3,
68220,scrap the two  the single  the penny  half dollar and nickel instead,3,
68221,scrap the drugs too  make them illegal  oh wait,1,
68222,but they just click buttons on a computer and create and move money around  wait  what,1,
68223,than how will our government and cia function,1,

68225,singapore has had the 10000 singapore dollar bill for some time it is still legal tender  but is going to be phased out slowly old notes will not be replaced  this is a calculated strategy by the sg government to comply with international counterterrorism and anti money laundering efforts  but minimising their own vulnerability to regulatory arbitrage,1,
68226,is nt the  100 bill the staple of american foreign trade  i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like  interestfree  loans  though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ,1,
68227,politicians do nt use  100s so how could it harm criminals,1,
68228,what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then,1,
68229,gt  the  100 bill is actually the second most common us bill in circulation  behind the  1 bill  gt  nearly 80  of the  14 trillion of us currency in circulation is in  100 bills much of it is held outside the united states  i m no math magician  but this does nt seem to fit,1,
68230,yeah  just watch  they will scrap it right down to the 20  anyone who wants to make largeish purchases will have to use electronic accounts that can be tracked  oh yeah   because crime  not  because government needs to track your every move,1,
68231,this is one of those ideas that seems silly at first but the more you think of it  the more it makes some sense,1,
68232,this is stupid  criminals will make due with what ever currency there is  they do nt fucking care and any one who thinks otherwise is a desk jocky looking for something to do,1,

68235,how would this effect the bitcoin market,1,
68236,this is about getting rid of cash  not making life tougher for criminals that way  when the fed institutes negative interest rates  you the lowly consumer will be forced to spend your savings to avoid being charged for saving,1,
68237,funny thing  today also the eu central bank ceo emanuele prodi announced that 500 euro bills are to be outphased for the same reason apparently american criminals manage to launder money with a bill that s 6 times less in value  is nt this just a global banking scheme to rob us the power over our own money,1,
68238,yes those evil people in government would love to get rid of cash and make everyone just use electronic money because then  the bank has your money and you only have an iou which they may  or may not  pay you back in the future  look at cyprus in 2013 where people did nt get their full deposited funds back because of the financial crisis  also they can charge you negative interest rateswhich means you have to pay for the bank to hold your funds  and of course if the govt has your money  then they have a great deal more power over you in deciding whether they should be nice and give it back to you or not  this is another reason why bitcoin is good  although they will ban that long before they ban cash,1,
68239,now  whatchall wan na do  wan na be ballers  shotcallers  brawlers  who be dippin in the benz wit tha spawlers,,

68247,i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever,8,
68248,cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification  one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry,5,
68249,they re public officials and public servants  appointedhiredelected we re entitled to see what these records are  without exception,8,

68259,umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops there s hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops,,
68263,free expression runs counter to the new religion of progressivism the two simply are not compatible,5,
68264,before you all get too deep in to your selfrighteous conservative circlejerk  you guys are aware that this commissioner was a former verizon executive who spoke out avidly against net neutrality  right  dont you think it s a bit rich to believe that he gives any fucks about free expression,1,
68265,from the regressive left s perspective  by censoring and silencing opposing opinions  especially those from sources merely  perceived  as not being   progressive   regressive enough  they are allowing for  traditionally oppressed groups  to   be used as a mouthpiece that ca nt be challenged because of cries of racism   speak  just as long as they say the correct    progressive   regressive things ,,
68267,i believe this is constitutional and on a case by case basis i am ok with thisand to have full call or text records released from the carrier this is why we have court ordersbut carte blanche any time access  no  that is unacceptable,5,
68268,they can helpsorry  it did nt work,1,
68270,while the koches paid the mob in nevada to outlaw anything similar there or so i hypothesize,1,
68272,sounds a lot like hitech money laundering to m,1,
68274,thats bad news for all the 711 in our town that take the,8,
68275,does nt this just translate into fewer places for poor people to buy food,7,
68276, 711 cashiers will now have to ring up cigarettes as organic kale instead of hot pockets,7,
68277,on the other hand  if the business stops taking food stamps entirely  not only can they not get the kale you want to make them eat  but they also ca nt get a loaf of bread or gallon of milk unless they start selling their food stamps to get cash to buy the milk and bread so the business still makes their money  the amount of food stamp fraud goes up  and the poor that you claim to be helping are getting even less food  healthy or otherwise  because of the food stampcash exchange rate,5,
68278,why are nt food stamps like wic  with wic you get vouchers for specific food items these items cover the basic food groups and align with a certain amount of nutritional value  meanwhile  you can buy friggin monster energy drinks with food stamps that makes no sense  regardless if you are looking at it from a healthy standpoint or a taxpayer standpoint,6,
68279,if obesity and other nutrition related issues are such a problem among the poor  would nt it be more cost effective to do away with food stamps and implement something like a food box program instead  in other words would the cost of labor to package and ship prepared food boxes in bulk to grocery stores and distribution centers be offset by what would be saved in reduced healthcare costs  imagine a program where you list the people in your household  any allergies or specific requirements and a box is prepared to supplement your family for a week it could contain things like rice  beans  canned or pouched goods like meats  vegetables and fruits  dried oatmeal and cereals  powdered milk  cooking oil every month they could receive a selection of 5 spices  salt and pepper and even a recipe pamphlet if in addition to the box  they started a program where grocery stores and produce growers could drop off older or bruised produce  people could pick some up for free when they picked up their boxes,7,
68280,what if the healthy foods do nt sell  are they still forced to stock them  would nt you think the actual grocers in the neighborhood would have a better sense of what their customers want than the federal government,4,
68281,no they ll stop or pack up and leave  ahhhincentives,4,
68282,you can lead them to water  but you ca nt make them drin,5,
68283,we have jackinthebox here in phoenix that has we accept ebt  signs up all over pisses me off  same thing at the gas station when you see children without any parents around loading up on overpriced candy and soda and  sure enough  out comes the ebt card or even worse is when they are  with  the adult and loading up on dog shit  food stamps should only be foractual food,3,
68284,honestly this will be great  the state  should  be very involved in what people eat for free,1,
68285,another  good intention  bad policy,1,
68286,this is the dark side of welfare  the constitution is completely circumvented the government has the power to cajole and pressure when it is putting stipulations on the money it gave out the government is capable of doing things it would never have the power of doing otherwise  like forcing a business to carry certain products  or forcing a person to apply for jobs or eventually  forcing people to work at government labor jobs,,
68287,because dontravious demands fresh cilantro,1,
68288,i wonder how much crime in a store would go down if the store was no longer food stamp approved,1,
68290,how do i get one of these fuck around on the internet jobs,9,
68291,because twitter has been such a phenomenal business succes,9,
68292,gt  luckie  s new role will entail working with media organizations  as well as government organizations  to understand how they  re currently using reddit and what their needs are from the platform  luckie told me he  ll then take that feedback and build it into reddit  s product  with the goal of making reddit more accessible to a broader community of people  so reddit will listen to what they like and dislike and then hand feed us whaat they want us to hear no longer will it be us posting what we find interesting and up or down voting it for exposure as much as it is meant to be  that s what i am hearing just another nail,9,
68293,gt  the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do nt we have that subreddit already ,8,

68300,just as a precaution  i think we all should be putting on our life jackets,6,
68301,does this dude give off  profitability  pixie dust when he walks around the office  what is causing all of these companies  reddit  yahoo  twitter  vox  salon  mashable  github  gawker  etc  in decline to try and make up for shitty business practices with diversity hires  it does nt matter how many black activist and feminists you hire  that wont solve a lack of profitability and coming from a company that tanked  and you were suppose to be part of the solution  is nt exactly a gold star on your resume you are suppose to jump ship from companies that are failing not get on board,7,
68302,aka manipulator in chief,6,
68303,so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming and this was the great marketing that is killing them,5,

68306,it s about ethics in reddi,3,
68307,just read about how twitter is filtering political content of a particular kind good news for reddit  they re on their way to being another propaganda wing of the left,1,
68308,great  a news manager  amp  head of journalism  with the attention span of one sentence  and the intellectual depth of a drunk on a 24 hour train ride  note  reddit is a whore for anything that emanates out of the roman catholic ponzi generating pope s pie hole perhaps the new head of journalism  could find another criminal organization to support on reddit instead of the catholic church criminal empire,,

68313,it s fun that the government has turned the words freedom and patriot in to code words for tyrannical  and selfish,1,

68315,allowing people to do what they want with their own property is nt antigay  it s profreedom and proequality the right to follow your on conscience is as fundamental as the right to follow your own gender identity equality under the law is as far as laws should go,1,

68326,i have spent some time among the government arab workers of these nations and i have no pity for the trials that lie ahead of them in the real world  they wielded their unearned wealth with a brash arrogance  putting themselves above other races with a disgusting assumption that they were somehow favored by god  and therefore inherently better than others in fact  it was equally distasteful for them when an american did  not  wield their racenationality with a pompous arrogance because this undermined their own claim to legitimacy  this was not some single unpleasant person i dealt with it was the overwhelming majority out of 100 citizens  there were maybe 5 people who had enough wisdom and openmindedness to question such an absurd world view  for example  on a hot day i was supervising pakistani and indian workers doing our manual labor for us  as it would have been unbecoming for an arab and an american to be doing manual labor i took some of our cold water bottles we had in our cooler and offered them to the workers  but was stopped by one of the head guys  do nt do that   he warned me shaking his head his message was clear  he did nt want the workers to get used to that treatment  i witnessed minorities berated and even physically accosted at times only americans and british were spared from the cruel racism that pervades the arab world it seeps into your daily life and if you live in it long enough you even start to internalize it ugh  i am looking forward to the cold splash of reality to wash over that region and wake many of those intolerant people up from their slumber,7,

68330,have done some research in saudi echoing similar things everybody wants government jobs  but the government is trying to push private sector employment  so you end up with many saudis who do nt do anything showing up on payrolls and there s a somewhat true perception that most companies would prefer to hire foreigners  who will work harder  over citizens  not sure what the longterm solution is for the employment problems  but crashing oil revenue is definitely going to make things worse will be interesting to see if government is going to start shrinking public sector employment more heavily,5,

68400,i ve had them as an isp for several years and they re excellent i did have one month where i went over my allowed bandwidth limit  300 gb on a 50 mbps down plan   and all i got was an email saying  do nt do that again   no throttling or charges or anything on 100 mbps down plan right now and i usually get 110 at least they re great  come out to me if i m having internet trouble that s not solved by online support  etc pretty good basically  i love cox and i m very satisfied with how much i get,3,
68401,unrelated but i could nt stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox,3,
68402,i am a proud supporter of cox,3,
68403,where are all the penis jokes,3,
68404,not as nice as it sounds if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do nt catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status  eg that they do nt have any liabilityresponsibility for what people use their pipe for   most carriers are  very  vested in not being the internet police,3,
68405,i m guessing that if they had a way to monetize it and add to the bottom line  they d be very supportive,3,
68406,when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battl,5,
68407,cox is actually a familyowned business one of the major interest holders is a 96 year old woman who inherited from her father  she had been running it with her sister until her death in 2007   i happen to think they re one of the leastshady isp and cable providers out there  they also own the travel channel  which is a pretty great channel,4,
68408,i thought this was talking about jesse cox,5,
68409,i work for cox corporate in a startup tech company  and this makes me so happy  btw  they re just as decent an employer as they are an isp compan,3,
68410,cox is spying like a champ  rest assured you have to be quite innocent or high on meth to think they have nt supplied info to big brother and his little brothers  and will not in the future,3,
68411,yells loudly  i will not    whispers  if you need me too,1,
68412,on that headline alone  i thought jessie cox was asked to spy on his youtube subs  was very confused for a little bit,1,
68413,i knew he was my favorite eagl,1,
68414,well that s one bit of good news from cox now if they d stop raising my rates every few months,1,
68415,damn  i wish i had cox i have time warner and i m on my 3rd notice to stop torrenting i do nt know if they ll actually pull the plug  they re charging me out the ass already since they re the only provider in my area,1,
68416,fuck yea cox   comcast   1  co,1,
68417,cox  and to some extent time warner  are cable companies all cable companies fuck you in the ass  these two have the decency to spit on it first i at the very least get what i pay for with both of them,1,
68418,they sent me a few emails in the past  so i got a vpn i will still use it  but good on cox for not being dickbags,1,
68419,they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jone,1,
68420,i had cox for 3 years service was good  and over that 3 years  doubled my download speeds twice no extra cost upload was still garbage  but hey 10015 internet for  65 a month was still pretty killer i have 7575 fios now,1,
68421,almost every single person in my area that has gone to atamp  t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable  they have some shit with them but it s far less shit than others,1,
68422,they re my isp and even though they re the only isp in my city besides att and verizon  they ve been awesome,1,
68423,the shifting of blame to continue  going after johns and endusers has never worked,1,
68424,ho yeah  today is a good day to have cox  teehee,1,
68425,horseshit they cut off our internet because someone was downloading something like a year ago they re the best isp i ve ever used  but they absolutely do exactly what the mpaa et al want,1,
68426,between cox and cable one in both places i live  i actually like our midwest internet providers i feel bad for people getting rammed by twc and comcast we ve paid  45 for 100mbps for several years  which sounds way better than the horror stories i hear from you guys,1,
68427,cause they love internet freedom  or because it costs an extra 30 cents to have an extra indian screen data at the call center for 70 an hour,1,
68428,protected pirate plan from cox   7500month,1,
68431,they can still go to the doctor and get the scans on their ow,1,
68433,gt  man wanted for 66 sex offenses with child i hope that is nt a craigslist ad,6,
68435,i was happier before i knew this subculture existed,9,
68436,so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10 that does nt make much sense,9,
68437,how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killedhow from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human,9,
68438,one of these videos was sent to me many years ago  forwarded on a myspace page  yeah  many  years ago   they were trying to  raise awareness  when they sent it to me to help the people get caught  but all they really ended up doing was spreading that ghastly thing to more points of the internet i wo nt describe a single second of it  but suffice it to say that it s horrifying i ve never been able to remove the memory i ve been through a lot in my military career  and yet seeing a 2minute version of one of those videos was easily the most horrible thing i have ever witnessed,9,
68439,gt  brent justice  54  was convicted and sentenced monday for cruelty to nonlivestock animals  i guess justice has been served,9,
68440,i ca nt imagine the mentality of the person making it or watching it and people get off on it    who the hell sees a cat being stabbed in the eye and thinks  hey  time to get the jergens  ,9,
68441,no complaints from me but i ve noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago,9,
68442,for once  reading a story of horrifying animal abuse does nt fill me with rage this must be what justice feels like finally  an appropriate sentence so sick of people like these getting slaps on the wrist due to inadequate animal protection laws,9,
68443,i read the title then thought  hhmmm what s an animal crush video   who would have thunk it  animal crush videos are videos of animals getting crushed there goes some of the little remaining faith i had in humanit,9,
68444,i m not saying this is nt some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder,9,

68454,i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective it was the first exposure i d ever had to this subculture  crush fetish   after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals  their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse that s all i have to say about that,1,

68548,living in germany and studying  i m gon na pay 300   335   for the upcoming semester  these 335  also includes a public transportation ticket  which is in your student id  that allows me to take the train  bus  tram etc at any time as much as i like in my entire state  books are nt nearly as expensive as in the us  the most expensive book i bought last semester was 80   89    but  seriously  95  of the content for the majority of the courses are uploaded on the university s website  files and documents which you can download for free  also  the university canteen offers you decent food for a fair price  normally around 35   in the end my biggest expenses during my semester are the coffees i buy on campu,9,
68549,i m from the uk and have lived in germany for 6 years now i came here with a 20000 gbp student loan for a 4 year degree in computer science  now i m about to start a masters in web science that will cost me about 1000 eur for the 2 year course  parttime and remote  i m also just about to get german citizenship  most germans are happy to speak english  i have a job here and although most of the company speak english they make i point of speaking german with me  and i with them  i m not very good at german but am slowly learning now after 5 years of being very lazy about learning the language it s a very hard language to learn  screw those articles   but in time you ll get used to it  i absolutely love speaking to locals in german and being understood by them  to me it s like being on another planet and finally being accepted by the local populus  good luck to anyone who wants to come over  it is a wise move  come and see me near koblenz,9,
68550,a friends son went to college in switzerland  we are american  even though he paid additional fees as a non native  and had to travel back and forth to europe  he still paid less than kids who went to local colleges,9,
68551,come gather around the fire and listen to a tale of a spooky and simple explanation of our increasing tuition rates in the us  the government started giving student loans kids take the debt  the schools get the money tuition prices increase because they can rely on the kids to get a gov loan take away student loans  then schools ca nt rely on this money  kids ca nt afford the jacked up tuitions  enrollments drop  schools are forced to cut tuition  now more affordable again it s the same problem with mortgage crisis  just a different industry,9,
68552,it s almost as if germany sees the benefit of having a well educated work force that is not bogged down by insurmountable debt,9,
68553,my college actually sodomizes me,9,
68554,whereas here in the states  they will gladly charge you a  250semester parking fee and you will still not actually be guaranteed a space,8,
68555,maybe i should go to germany,9,
68556,currently living in germany  as an american student on an international internship  what this is nt telling you is that the uni system is significantly different my roommates  all in engineering or other sciences  study all day every day they have a month of exams coming up  and they usually have only one exam per year you fail that  you fail no assignments  projects  etc  just that exam  did i mention this was a fraternity  yeah  they do nt go to uni because everyone does it  like america they work  they get accepted  and they work even more it is nt for partying  it is nt for meeting your spouse or friends  it s for becoming the best you can be  which is how a university should be  good luck to the americans coming here thinking it s anything like the states enjoy the d  ner,9,
68557,something like this gets posted everysingleweek without fail and then a bunch of americans start making hasty decisions to just go study in germany because it s  free   oh and it has been this way for years so it is nt a new thing  the german courses that you will have to take for at least a year to reach fluency are around  300 a month and noduolingo is absolutely not enough to get you to the level you need to study at university  the fees for applications are at  75 then an additional 15  for each university you apply to after the first it can go well into the hundreds  the bank account you have to open for your student visa has to have a frozen amount of at least approx   8500 this is nt to say it is impossible but do nt expect roses and rainbows and raining beer amp  wurst to await your easy university life in germany  also american universities except the few ivy leagues or outstanding schools  baby the absolute shit outta you you can pretty much sail smoothly your first two years while you get your core courses out of the way in germany  you jump right into it in german remember  a different language a crazy  difficult language at that the high school diploma is also not equivalent to the german one that allows you to study at a university the equivalent would be a plethora of ap courses with really good grades or a high school diploma plus two years of college with really good grades and then you re equivalent to a german high school graduate  you will also most likely not be able to transfer credits  german bureaucracy  a bitch you will have to have german knowledge when applying for your visas or someone to be a translator there with you  you may have to do a prep year for certain programs as well it is also very competitive to get into even these programs  i sound like fucking scrooge but i ve been through all of it as so have many people i met along the way  it is possible but it will take a lot of hard work and dedication and time that you wo nt regret  losing  because it may not work out perfectly you may get rejected you may not be accepted for that semester a lot of the popular programs have a cap so it s very restricted in terms of amount of students accepted  do nt expect germany to be a country that is just waiting and fiddling its thumbs for the americans to come and study in their unis for  free  and think that they re gon na make it easy for you it is anything but,9,
68558,my american husband started learning german at the age of 26 a year later he was admitted to vet school here he s almost finished now we ve been paying 120 euros a semester i think he s the only foreign student to not drop out in his class though the drop out rate is high even for germans while he s happy he is debt free  the immense stress of having to learn a very hard subject in a foreign language and a foreign system  bureaucracy is insane here   have caused many panic attacks and one major case of depression and he has nt even started the huge final exam yet but at least we wo nt be  200k in debt when this is over,8,
68559,the fee is actually 150500  per semester books inclusive because of librarys and because we live in 2016 and share digitaly public transport also free  you get 600  per month plus health care  if your parents arent rich  this will be checked by government  as student  and will have to pay back   half of that   in worst conditions after you finished  also  after 3 semesters you must have passed 23 of your finals at any time to get your  baf  g  money  but this will only be checked once no money for extra semesters of course,9,
68560,currently living in duisburg  germany and studying at the university of duisburgessen   my choice   i grew up in the us  but my parents are from germany after graduating high school it became apparent that studying in germany was an opportunity that i could not pass up i chose my current uni because it has an international studies in engineering program which allows me to pursue a bachelors degree in computer engineering with the first year taught entirely in english   costs   the costs are definitively low the semester fee  including public transport  is below 300   my total living expenses are below 700  a month and that includes health insurance   my experience so far   keep in my mind i m still in my first semester  as others have mentioned before  the majority of students quit after the first year last year  the failure rate of an exam taken by 200 students was over 95   attending lectures is completely voluntary and there is one exam at the end of each course that makes up 100  of your final course grade no homework is given and you are very much on your own forcing yourself to focus and learn everyday can be a serious challenge  feel free to comment or pm with any questions,7,
68561,many american students also come with very false expectations about what german university is like you have to be way more self organised and please do nt expect multiple choice tests,9,
68562,we need to stop this immigration because when america sends its people  it sends unskilled people and we have to spend our money on them we are going to build a wall  get america to pay for it and make germany great again,9,
68563,you can only offer something for free if you limit supply fewer germans go to college than us students   only 30  of germans ages 2534 have completed a tertiary education  which includes academic degrees and some but not all vocational programs that  s below the oecd average  and below the us 45  attainment rate for the same age group  http  wwwlatimescomlocaleducationcommunitylameedufreecollegeeducationingermanybutnotincalifornia20151029htmlstoryhtml edit  so now i am amused that many people are suggesting that fewer people should go to college in the us  presumably other people  not so much themselves they are smart   it seems like this would be a less popular proposal than promising free tuition,9,

68594,bison burgers bison steaks bison roasts  yum,8,
68595,the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison,6,
68596,are they only being killed for food  that s slaughter  if they are being killed for management purposes  that s called culling,6,
68597,it s population control  hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use,6,

68618,hopefully australia has a similar thing to the usa where prisoners are paid like 47 cents per day,6,
68619,not as bad as actual slaves that work in unpaid internships,5,
68620,well  when the tpp goes through we ll all get to enjoy such working conditions  the fact of the matter is that this occurs constantly  the authorities refuse to investigate and the workers lack the leverage to bring the employers to court,1,
68621,here in the us the government would go after ahmed and not see an issue with what was going on monetarily  edit  some of you really need to step away from the computer and not take this place so seriously,,

68627,if only they used that cyber attack on shitbag israel instead lahymen,,
68629,that article is really light on details  does anyone know why this happened  did the guy not respond to a court summons or something along those lines  is nt a default the judgement the usual result in that situation,9,
68630,this happened in feb  2003 in minnesota as well  article   http  wwwmndailycom20030214usmarshalsarreststudentloandebtorstwincities,9,
68631,what happens if you literally ca nt pay your loans  asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11  just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job  edit  something a lot of you do nt seem to realize is that these were private loans there s no forgiveness with those,9,
68632,not really too much context given here  so it s hard to guess at the actual situation  but federal student loans  at least direct loans and the majority of those older loans passed back to fsa as they phased out the guarantee programs  do nt get sold to private collection agencies at this time maybe that part happened a while back  before current policies went into place and the collectors are taking advantage of the protections that federallyoriginated loans have  anyway  for people who are interested in learning more about how defaulted federal student loans are being collected today   check this out   https  wwwfbogovindex  s  opportunityamp  mode  formamp  id  216a8418f8e71f0c9c3475946ab100f8amp  tab  coreamp  _cview  1  they re currently in the middle of contracting new private collection agencies to service defaulted loans and you can see in the rfp documents how agencies are being scored and how that ties into account assignments  basically  for those who do nt feel like running through all of it  the big emphasis for student loan collections now is getting people through affordable rehabilitation options and into incomedriven repayment plans placements look like they re going to be based about 50  on careful regulatory compliance and borrower satisfaction surveys  which would make it extremely difficult for high pressure collections tactics to work out in the long run  none of that changes this story  just thought it was interesting in light of some of the comments i ve read that indicate people believe strongarm collection tactics for student loans will always be the norm  tldr  they re at least trying to throw a friendly paint job over the horribly broken federal student loan system these days,9,
68633,if you dont show up to court after you have been served this is what happens he has been ignoring collection attempts  he got served and ignored that too im not in favor of this man being arrested but you cant ignore court summons if you get served you have to go,9,
68634,upconwell said it best  gt  you are reading way to much into the article no one said they were violent no one said they had their guns drawn they are us marshals  they carry guns  every god damn day   gt  they probably went to his door  knocked he answered and they said  hey  we have a warrant for you for failing to appear in a federal court   he probably said  oh shit let me get some pants  gt  no violence  no guns drawn  everything was pretty standard and nonviolent  gt  plus  it should be noted that he was not arrested for failing to pay student loans  he was arrested for violating a court order,9,
68635,how do you not pay a  1500 loan after 30 friggin years,9,
68636,gt  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  this almost reads like satire,9,
68637,i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors,9,
68638,where in this article did it say  guns drawn  as most people are stating here  it says  with guns   every on duty us marshal goes through their day  with guns   someone signed a contract for a loan  and then spends almost three decades not paying it i agree that a police force should nt have been used there are financial measures that can be taken upon default of a loan rather than criminal  but i m really surprised by the circle jerk that s happening over a fox news article,9,
68639,can i get a misleading title please,8,
68640,you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day,6,
68641,lol  you guys are so gullible the guy dodged this debt and refused to engage the proper authorities for 25 years this is nt a new college graduate that missed one payment then you have the cascade of predictable posts stating  boot lickers    debtors prison  and how in 30 years this will be the watershed moment we all look back to as we are enslaved by the government this is a statement case the feds took an extreme example and made an extreme example of this putz the goal of this action is compliance and to get folks to not ignore their obligations the money spent on this will scare the other million folks that are past due to actually pick up the phone and engage them to resolve the debt no one held a gun to this guy s head to sign up for the student loans and no one was stopping him for 25 years from making a payment plan for the remaining  1500 this guy deserved it and as a tax payer this is ok by me,9,
68642,real story here dude was sued by the united state of america  he refused to appear  a default judgment was issued against him  he refused to appear for postjudgment depositions  judge issued an order directing him to appear in court  he ignored it and then the judge issued an arrest warrantincareration order and federal judges use us marshalls to enforce their orders  so he was nt arrested for having old student loans he was arrested for refusing to comply with a direct order from the judge  http  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386htm,8,
68643,that dude could not come up with  1500 in 29 years,8,
68644, a few years ago congress allowed the private sector to contract for student loan collections and so you have these private companies who are doing this  i find this scary  even though i have no student loans to pay off they dragged this dude to court and made him sign an agreement in front of their private attorney he had no attorney present  and was nt read any rights  edit  quote is from the video,9,
68645,forever grateful i graduated with minimal student loans ca nt ignore bills for 25 years though  regardless of what those payments stem from from reading through the comments here  it seems like incomebased payment option is the smartest option,5,
68646,i wish my student loan balance was  1500,6,
68647,i knew this story was light on facts turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies  source   yahoo finance   https  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386html,5,
68648,gt  our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is nt the first and wo nt be the last  this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least,8,
68649,he was nt arrested for not paying his loan  he was arrested for not showing up in court  and the marshals did nt storm his house guns blazing they had guns  with them   like every other cop in the entire country,7,
68650,if you take money and have no plans on paying it back  it s called stealing,9,
68651,right the debt collectors just bought the debt  payed the filing fees to bring the case to court  threatened the man with their now official   pay us or else  and when he did not they used their settlement to have him arrested by the marshals nope  no government officers for hire here  just good old debt collection paid and serviced through the courts,5,
68652,til that most people have no understanding how the court system works  yes  civil attorneys can issue subpoenas  yes  a court can hold you in contempt if you fail to appear yes  a potential punishment for contempt is a bench warrant for your arrest  tl  dr  you can not simply ignore subpoenas you may go to jail,5,
68653,writing and publishing articles like this is dangerous the author offered a sensationalist angle on the  story  while leaving out key elements of why they were there in the first place ie missing court summons this is highly unethical and paints the federal government into a larger narrative that fox has been going for basically  rallying people by emotion not logic,6,
68654,this just in  there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government film at 1,5,
68655,student loans were made with certain assumptions about the future of the economy  both on the part of the schools  the tuition they charge   the lenders  and the student people should be required to pay their student loans but they should be adjusted downward  edit  this guy had a loan for  1500 measly bucks and did nt make any payments in 30 years  i would like to know if he was destitute  or just decided  fuck you everyone  i want to keep my money ,8,
68656,misleading title the marshals service will  arrest  you if you fail to show up for a court appearance you are not being tossed in jail  you are being hauled into court when you refused to answer a summons  from the article   paul aker says he was arrested at his home last week for a  1500 federal student loan he received in 1987  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  does anyone feel sorry for this man   1500  be serious,7,
68657,if i did nt pay back a federal loan for 29 years  i d kind of expect for there to be negative effects this dude did nt pay his loan  including when he was taken to court over it and received a judgment from the court specifically telling him to pay it if you ignore a court order  you re gon na have a bad time  i mean yes  the financial aid system needs to be fixed  but they re going after people who purposely are nt paying their loans which is a surprising amount of people  given how many refund chasers there are in the world for anyone else  there are programs like deferment options  sliding payscales  and whatever else along with loan forgiveness after 20 years  it s a shitty system  but this guy s case is not going to be the one to change it because he does nt deserve to have people dying on his hill for his particular cause,8,
68658,i m socialist and firmly believe that education and medical care should be paid for by federal government out of contributions that we make  however with that said  if you are contributing member of society you have to be a special kind of asshole not to repay  1500 loan over the period of 29 years no matter what was that loan used for,8,
68659,why is this news,5,
68660,dude got letters in his mail for months to pay and appear in court  this doesnt just come out of the blue he refused to show up to court multiple times thats a criminal offense,5,
68661,the revolution will not be subsidize,5,
68662,the whole student loan thing is a complete disaste,4,
68663,talk is cheap  between the intelligence agencies  an the lack of marijuana decriminalizatoinlegalizatoin  obama is nt that idfferent from previous administration,5,
68664,just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to the paper really is nt worth it otherwise college is becoming a joke anyways,5,
68665,every interaction i have ever had with navient  they have done everything they can to work with me  is your payment affordable  would you like a deferment  etc  i have had to take them up on that because of divorce not saying that is everyone s experience but they have nt been the loan sharks everyone else seems to act like they are just one man s experience though,5,
68668,so not only are these disputed  there are now long term  long range weapons on them,1,
68670,has nt he already had  like  two years to prevent this in the first place,7,
68671,lansing has actually dealt with this problem and their civil engineers have a solution which is both fast and more costeffective than traditional measures they connect the end of the new pipe to the old pipes so when they pull out the old pipe they simultaneously thread the new pipes into the existing space this speeds up the process and the people in lansing estimate with adequate training  involving them with the process in flint  and hiring enough crews it can be completed for flint in one year,7,
68672,this whole situation is a national embarrassment  and it makes my blood boil  but what does naacp have to do with city water  is it a race issue as well  i ve never seen the demographics on flint  come to think of it  maybe aspca should get involved  too i bet people are still feeding their pets city water no matter what  edit  i just think it should be about officials   doing their fucking jobs    framing it as a race issue might just come back to bite us  who knows how many towns are discreetly checking for  and finding  elevated lead  should it matter how many african americans live there  if so  how should officials proceed differently  will it result in a process of public relations triage  that prioritizes black communities  public officials just need to do their fucking jobs for the public they serve there s no need to complicate this with race,5,
68673,that s like threatening to get one of those online white house petitions going it does nt matter,1,
68674,fix flint s water pipes or they ll burn flint to the ground,3,

68711,good for him  football does nt have to be a concussion prone sport it started as the american version of rugby  and evolved into the form we see today  and can just as properly evolve into something that is nt effectively a form of human sacrifice  part of how it evolved is the career of pop warner  the coach of the carlisle indian school he kept  how to put it  coaching like a lawyer  and coming up with clever ways to get an edge  that would then eb slapped down with rule changes  surely concussions justify rule changes too,7,

68727,offitherrrr i am the la,9,
68728,no one has mentioned this yet but she got pulled over at 8 am drinking in the morning  this judge has some problems,9,
68729,rochesterian here the article failed to mention that she was also driving with 2 flat tires for who knows how long,8,
68730,in fairness  if i was a judge in rochester i d need a few drinks before work too,9,
68731,i drove through rochester today  has anyone ever heard of a garbage plate,9,

68734,that would suck to have your case decided by a slurring women,9,
68735,if i know new york this should be a nasty slap on this wrist especially for those in powerful position,7,
68736,what seems to be the officer  problem,6,
68737,well who s gon na judge the case now,5,
68738,her judgement was impaire,6,
68739,fry needs to weigh in here  http  imgurcomgvji0u,5,
68740,to be clear  the fact that she refused a breathalyzer is important in many states it is treated as evidence of impairment and justification for arrest she knew that i have many friends who are criminal defense attorneys and all have told me they advise to refuse breathalyzer always  unless there is a court order  i m not familiar with ny law  but i can pretty much guarantee she will not be convicted of dui if middle classcollege kids can get out of them  a federal judge surely can since it said nothing about a field sobriety test  i assume they either did nt administer one  or they did and she did not meet criteria for impairment,5,
68741,my friends mom is a judge and that lady boozes super hard and will drive her car around i have seen her come home from the bar completely in ruins at least a dozen times over the last 10 years she is fearless  we live in a small town in wisconsin with a huge police presence she knows all the officers and has never had an issue the whole situation seems completely ridiculous she gives out sentences for dui all day and then drives drunk all night oh god  the hypocrisy,5,
68742,ny state troopers only care about the star program more tixarrest  promotionmoney so if they could get points on there own mother they would,5,
68743,i m just amazed that our local news channel in lafayette is on the front page of reddit x,5,
68744,regardless of judge plates  why shouldare judges treated any differently  if i expect to get pulled over and ticketed for 5mph over i believe a judge should too especially since they make 15 times the income,5,
68745,i feel like poor judgement like this should make you not a judge anymore,5,
68746,oh they decided the law applies today,5,
68747,many  if not most  political figures are serious alcoholics when you combine the constant parties and  fundraisers  that they are expected to attend with the stress of the job  a lot of them end up drinking a lot,8,

68751,gt  a sixcount federal complaint out of nevada charges cliven bundy with conspiracy to commit an offense against the united states  assault on a federal law enforcement officer  obstruction of justice  interference with commerce by extortion and two counts of carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence  cliven bundy  you dumb fucktard  your time has arrived,3,
68752,cliven bundy and his patriot militia are a joke  now they are afraid to bend over for a bar of soap they thought with enough guns they would win thru intimidation  now  reality is sinking in  along with humiliatio,1,
68754,i m going to assume that the project is getting a lot of input from people who were ignored for the last couple years andor late additions from people who just walked in the door  typical design by committee bullshit that happen,3,
68755,put the team behind the bay bridge project in charge it will become a guaranteed success   hopefully the s wo nt be necessary,1,
68756,oh  cboss  communication based overlay signaling system  ptc  positive train control   yea  i personally worked on this project it was not a fun place to work i quit after a year,1,
68757,ah the browndogle wasting tax payers money for years to come,,
68759, bundy allegedly does nt vaccinate or treat his cattle for disease and does nt employ cowboys to herd them  so he  has to bait them into traps in order to gather them   prosecutors said  wtf  he has to bait and trap his cattle  is this guy for real,4,
68761,i have my own super secret private social network site that only i know about,6,
68762,so  i read the article and it appears the site was not created by anonymous but anonymous advocates the site  i believe facebook could use some healthy competition  though i question how private anyone s information can be on the internet  even with encryption it seems no matter how much you try to protect someone s information online  there is always someone who  with enough time and ingenuity  can obtain it,5,
68763,anyone else get the feeling this was an ad,4,
68764, doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  i have watched criminal minds penelope can do it,6,
68765,given the propensity of anonymous for leaking confidential and private information of people who do nt share their viewpoints  i do nt know how super private it would stay if someone expressed a contrary opinion would my belief that kanye is an immature narcissist result in release of the name and location of my virginity loss  or my 2nd grade teacher  btw  not the same person ,6,
68766,i bet tom from facebook is already a membe,3,
68767,gt  but unlike its competitors it doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  so how does it make money to pay for development  management  support  bandwidth  and servers  i do nt know how this shit gets reported slow news day  remember that stupid  social network  diaspora  they got global coverage about their facebook alternative i do nt think they ever even finished the product  let alone had anyone use it  must be built by the son of some important news editor who can drum up publicity this is likely the same,5,
68768,so if i log into reddit on the tor network and my verification email account  if i were to use one  was anonymous  would nt that be the same thing,3,
68769,facebook s shills are working overtime in this posts comments i hope this social media site becomes a viable alternative,3,
68770,private social media pick one,1,
68771,i love when people treat shit like this like news downvote it to where it belongs,,
68772,eh  with anonymous s history of doxxing people  i rather not use anything that they have a hand i,,
68773,so some social dropout  400 lb teenage hackers are going to be watching over other the private data of other people  i do nt think the anonymous group realizes how much they are despised across the internet,,
68774,i would trust this site over facebook,,
68776,gt  gt  johnson says the man s family will be shown body camera footage of the incident before it s released publicly  well  that s an improvement,6,
68777,personally working as security guard in a hospital  and having to deal with people who have mental health issues its not fun  or safe and generally the actual hospital staff is nt very helpful i ve been kicked in the head  punched in the face  and many other things happen sometimes these people can not be handled and tazeing could deescalate the situation,4,
68778,from what i ve read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops it looks like the taser use was justified sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca nt be deescalated otherwise  has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died,7,
68779,this is unacceptable tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are nt,7,
68780,he died 5 days later at a different hospital  clickbait headline i m sure we ll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death,6,
68781,well at least the officers saved the victim from harming  himself ,4,
68782,he died a week later he was also resisting arrest,3,
68783,officers ca nt subdue people without shocking them to deathstun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only not some wack trying to get mental help,,
68784,oh this is lame  his identity has not been released  nor the race of the officers   wtf does that have to do with anything  oh that s right more race bating by the media,1,
68785,police are to trigger happy they could easily have uses theiroh,1,
68786,the article states he was attacking staff and police using glass vials the police were not obliged to wrestle this violent person and risk getting stabbed by broken glass it s pretty simple  do nt violently attack innocent people and you wo nt be tased,,
68787,police are not there  to protect and serve  you  edit   warren v district of columbia   https  enwikipediaorgwikiwarren_v_district_of_columbia  is just one example that downvoters should read,,
68790,idiot drinks and drives and shares it with people over some app idiot gets arrested for drinking and driving it is the idiots first time offense and the idiot gets sentenced to standard punishment for a first time offense nothing to see here,9,
68791,is that typical for a first time offense in florida,8,
68792,12 months of probation plus losing your license is pretty standard,6,
68793,i mean  many states and counties do nt do mandatory jail time for first time duis,8,
68794,heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off fre,8,
68795,her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui,8,
68796,most people do nt go to jail for first time dui the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though,5,
68797,10 day vehicle impound  that is just a rich vs poor sorter  the poor people cant pay for ten days of impound at  80night right away  so every day they wait to pay its another  80 then they lose their car,7,

68799,reddit   there are too many people in prison     person is treated with leniency   reddit   kill her   look  the point of prison is to rehabilitate  keep society safe  or punish maybe this lady was given a hefty amount of probation  something i often ask for because you always have time to throw someone away and put them in prison  but they do nt get that time back  so they ll lose their jobs  houses  children  etc how exactly does society benefit from that   maybe she has a lot of factors that call for mitigation,5,
68800,it was nt flordia man it was flordia woman,7,
68801,as a 40 year old  are the younger people with smart phones really this fucking stupid  i have a smart phone  and the last freaking thing i do is broadcast every life choice i make what ever happened to  if no one knows  i wo nt get caught  i can remember going to parties in the early 2000 s when digital cameras were getting popular and i would shy away from them while drunk saw lots of compromising photos that did not tell the full story now we are at a point that people are broadcasting this shit live holly hell,4,
68802,premeditated drinking and driving is that a thing because she admitted to i,3,
68803,very happy she did nt hurt anyone  or herself,1,
68804,like it or not  this is pretty standard for 1st time dwi offenses especially since there was nt a wreck or damage to property,1,
68805,this is great pr for periscop,1,
68806,driving drunk is not easy,1,
68807,what is 10 day weekend work release,1,
68808,at first i thought this was a reasonable charge  but when i read the article it said that she was actually driving with a flat tire most drunks are smart enough to avoid driving on a flat  this woman is an idiot and deserves a harsh punishment she was intoxicated enough to seriously endanger the lives of others  if an officer had nt pulled her over i m sure she would have caused some serious damage,,
68809,that s cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work releas,,
68810,well it s not like you can prove that she was actually intoxicated  so the fact that she was nt punished seems appropriate,,
68811,and my mom wonders why i m not married,,
68814,hope he rots there for the rest of his miserable life,1,
68815,i just hope they can one by one get every one of those asshole cowboy actionfigure wannabes that showed up with their guns to display their extreme patriotism through their act of sedition,6,
68816,he s only 69 years old  i had him pegged for going on 80,1,
68818,the more information like this surfaces  the less skeptical i am about rumors that companies plan to  chip  employees,1,
68820,colleges really need to stop expelling students due to these kangaroo courts  i m fine with them if it s from breaking a school infraction like alcohol on a dry campus or something of that sort but  if a student is accused of a criminal offense  let the courts deal with it and decide from there  schools are nt equipped to deal with these kinds of cases  nor should they be expected to be these are lifechanging accusations and need to be treated as such  for the benefit of both parties involved,9,
68821,gt  ut investigators later decided  that the evidence supported a finding that  he  had sexually assaulted ms roe  the opposite of the conclusion reached by the more experienced detectives of the police department   the lawsuit says the dean of students then recommended he be expelled  ah but the police are looking for evidence that he did it  college tribunals assume he did and require he provide evidence that he did nt  which  typically  the accused is not allowed to present,9,
68822,gt  one plaintiff is a 24yearold recent graduate  the other is a 21yearold student who is one semester away from graduating with a bachelor  s degree in physics  their lawsuits say   in the graduate  s case  he faces being banned from any ut system campus  being denied a shot at a ut graduate degree and having a notation put on his transcript   the undergrad faces expulsion in addition to the same punishments  that does nt make any sense to me why would an institution retroactively amend the transcript of someone  who already graduated  to say this person violated school policy  after graduating   this seems to be more evidence that they re trying to scapegoat the plaintiffs here i mean  if they were concerned with the alleged victim s wellbeing more than trying to look  tough on sexual assault   what is the point of amending the transcript,9,
68823,who s the idiot who decided that kangaroo courts were a good idea,9,
68824,are we to the point where  sexual assaultrape  almost no longer have a meaning    you getting hammered and hooking up with a hammered guy is not rape  nor is it assault he should sue her for the exact same thing,8,
68825,i once saw a swedish movie called ondskan   evil  that drove me to become a lawyer today  here  https  enwikipediaorgwikievil_  2003_film   plot one of the key issues that caught my attention in this movie is the disregard of the law the school had to the protagonist s rights when he hired a lawyer  because of some grievance he had with the school  it backed off immediatly when the lawyer lay down the letter of the law to the headmaster of that educational institution in front of all his guests  in this university of texas sexual assault case  i believe imhlo  l is for legal   that the constitution sets a foundation of rules for everyone inside it s jurisdiction  and no internal policy that ut may have can go against the rules set by the us constitution everyone should enjoy the right of being innocent until proven guilty  and time and time again people are being layed off their jobs  students expelled  lives ruined because of yettobeproven  accusations  the right thing that any institution  like ut  should always do is address all cases of criminal behavior by always recognizing first the accused innocence until proven guilty in a court of law  edit  grammar,8,
68826,gt  the friend said she thought the woman was conscious because  when she saw her kissing this man  she was awake and talking  the lawsuit says  so intentionally or not the woman who claimed to be assaulted is not telling the truth  editand they decided to expel him without even talking to the student his first chance to give his side was an appeal for his expulsion this is a fucking kangaroo court  edit2  the second lawsuit claims expulsion against a student was recommended without the alleged victim ever personally making a sex assault accusation  http  kxancom20160205lawsuitsagainstutallegebiasagainstmalesinsexassaultcase,9,
68827,gt  the undergrad  s lawsuit says he had sex with a woman who was not a ut student after leaving a house party near campus sometime after midnight on march 6  2015 about a month later  the woman  s father called ut police and accused the man of sexually assaulting his daughter  fuck this i understand that if a woman is  actually  rapedmolestedassaulted it could be hard to come forward  but waiting a month or longer and  then  reporting it is bullshit you get raped  you report it immediately the longer you wait  the more i m going to doubt your accusation,7,
68828,gt  university police never spoke to the woman the undergrad was accused of assaulting and no criminal charges were ever pursued  his lawsuit says the father  s report was referred to the ut dean of students  okay what the hell  seriously  though its this sort of thing that makes me really hate schools handling sexual assault cases on their own the police did nt even talk to the accused victim  but decided to tell the dean instead  it feels like it happens all the time when we have these alternate systems of punishment we stop treating crimes like crimes and treat them like rule infractions a rule infraction is cheating on a test an alleged assault is a crime treat it like one,7,
68829,eli5 kangaroo courts thanks,8,
68830,activist administrators  check lack of due process  check prohibited from legal council or cross examination of the accuser  check nothin to see here  move along people,6,
68831,well  they are probably right these school kangaroo courts have demonstrated they have no respect for the privacy and rights of the accused  and are only interested in demonstrating how seriously they take sexual assault accusations,6,
68832,male privilege,8,
68833,the real lesson here is do nt trust anyone i certainly do nt anymore,6,
68834,reddit is nt okay with witch hunts  but the university of texas and 1600s salem encourage them,7,
68835,stay away from liberal colleges  they are cesspools of tumblrina ideals  i could barely stand the required diversity classes from my public university nothing but priviledge  patriarchy  and man hatin,8,
68836,it seems to me that a public institution has to follow the sixth amendment  which grants  the right to a public trial without unnecessary delay  the right to a lawyer  the right to an impartial jury  and the right to know who your accusers are and the nature of the charges and evidence against you,6,
68837,jane roe because jane doe would be incest,4,
68838,so these students that are expelled do they have to still pay back their loans even though they do nt get a degree now and can they carry their credits over to another school or are they now worthless,5,
68839,i love how at the end she implies that if there were a person punching people randomly on campus they would choose to not involve the police presumably so that the assault victims could  control their own destiny,3,
68840,30 year old here  and planning on returning to school with all this insanity about social values exploding everywhere  i may just hold off a few more years and wait for school to become a profitable idea again,3,
68841,gt  the university has been placed under enormous political pressure to appear tough on those accused of sexual assault  there s your problem right there how about be tough on those convicted of sexual assault and those whom the law decides are innocent be treated as such,3,
68842,umso expel the drunken slut too  right  i could get behind that they both got drunk and made bad choices that reflect poorly on the school kick em both out  why only the male  did he conspire in some way to get her drunk  if they re both adults that got drunk and fucked then they re both equally guilty,7,
68843,considering that almost every case of a rape accusation that s come out massively public has been shown to be fraudulent  i m reserving judgement on this one,3,
68844, ut investigates more than 100 allegations of sexual assault a year  and that number is growing  liebman said   how the hell are there hundreds of allegations a year that s insane this reminds me of the play the crucible  i saw you with the devilcommunistscapitalists  homo raptorus,1,
68845,damned if you do damned if you dont,1,
68846,seems like the girl was so hammered that she could nt remember the sex figured it would be less shameful if she accused him of assault,1,
68849,for those of you incapable of rtfa before making racist comments  the bride and groom are actors hired by a charity to raise awareness and the 37000day statistic refers to child marriages estimated worldwide not specifically in this local area,9,
68850,gt  nearly 15 million girls  some as young as eight or nine so  some as young as eight,9,
68851,37000 child marriages every day  if that s the case why are these people shocked  surely they must see these pedo photoshoots on the reg,8,
68852,these statistics seem unreliable estimated 12 billion new child marriages by 2050  even taking the 37000 a day estimate at face value that would only get you to 500 million by 2050  i mean seriously  assuming population growth rates remain unchanged  unlikely as the rate is slowing significantly  there will only be  47 billion women born under the age of 8 by 2050 is it truly believable that a quarter of women born in the next 34 years are going to be placed into a child marriage,8,
68853,ok this is a serious issue  but fuck the misleading clickbait title,8,
68854,paid to act and still goes for the hoverhand,4,
68855,as young as nine nine years old damn,4,
68856,i doubt half the people even read the article and thought the video was real they were actors and were stopped by plenty of people who called them criminals,6,
68857,i just wanted to point out the hand hove,1,
68858,where in lebanon was this  looks a bit like beirut if so  i can understand the mixed reactions i would wager the reactions would be less mixed in the northern or southern regions,1,
68859,i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country it s picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual some of them just do nt realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do,1,
68860,eh personally i m more concerned with men sitting with their legs spread on public transportation that s the real problem,1,
68861,at that rate the entire female population of the us would be married off in 11 years certainly 37000 child marriages a day is unsustainable or maybe it s media hype,1,

68863,pakistan tried to pass a law banning child marriages and the clerics said   nope  the koran says as soon as a girl menstruates  she can be dtf whoever she s married to  so you re not allowed to pass a law like that  so they took it back and child marriage continues to be legal,,

68885,just in time for the marijuana legalization bill this november,7,
68886,arizona   republican   legislators want to subvert the will of the people ftf,7,
68887,sounds reasonable to me  more easily  is such a loaded headline current law states ballot measures need 34th of both chambers of legislature to overturn ballot measures no matter how narrowly they pass mesnard wants to amend the law so that the amount needed to overturn is proportional to the margin the measure passed  people want to sit here and think this is some republican ploy on the grounds of marijuana measures  but what happens if some sleazy right wing john kavanagh inspired measure gets through at 51   there are certainly 15 az senators who ll support it and thus it ca nt be changed  this bill gives parity to both sides of the aisle,,
68889,now there is a precedence i hope apple can appeal this    ,1,
68890,i m 100  fine with this i ca nt believe they need apple though unless they want everything done legally,1,
68892,if the proposal came from a doctor or scientist  i would be 100  on the side of this bill but it comes from a senator  which makes me want to question it  scientific papers require peer review from the most qualified people to call bullshit on an idea before you can get it published as legitimate i m not saying i m questioning the idea  but i do nt know enough about the process of bills and laws to give it my automatic seal of approval  i think it s a good idea to administer anesthesia to an unborn human that can feel pain whether or not it increases the cost of abortion but the cost is still a talking point all i can do is hope that the people in charge of the decision in the end have the same concerns that i do,8,
68893,i mean  we already use anesthesia on fetuses when performing surgery in the womb for exactly this reason  so it s hardly surprising  http  wwwdoctorsonfetalpaincomfetalpaintheevidence5documentatio,7,
68894,wether a fetus is under anesthesia is completely dependent on the type of anesthetic being performed any general anesthetic also anesthetizes the fetus while other types like spinal or local do not even then  there is no accurate way to quantify or measure awareness in fetuses  much less adults undergoing anesthesia the body also still responds to pain under anesthesia  as its an autonomic response  so the definition of  feeling pain  is not something that should be measured i feel like awareness  which is impossible to measure in a fetus regardless  is a real idicator of humanity an easy solution would be to simply do all elective abortions under general anesthesia  which may cost more  but is easily doable i have no idea what the preferred method of anesthesia is  if any  for elective abortions  source  i do anesthesia in a catholic hospital,5,
68895,i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them,7,
68896,they have nt decided at what point of gestation this would happen  gt  montana lawmakers passed a similar law in 2015 requiring fetal anesthesia before surgeries  including abortion  after 20 or more gestational weeks  so  4 months the general consensus for viability outside the womb is around 6 monthsish for some the concept of consciousness coincides with viability outside the womb,6,
68897, this is a review on fetal pain   http  jamajamanetworkcomarticleaspx  articleid  201429amp  resultclick  1  from clinical review  although it is 10 years old it says  gt  evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques similarly  limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion,5,
68898,is nt this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor s office  would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder,4,
68899,i m going to talk about this as delicately as possible i  genuinely  want thoughts and opinions on this subject  i am asking that no one become immediately offended by what i m about to say rather than respond with your opinion telling me why you believe that my view should change i am childfree i do nt want kids  i m 35  so it s pretty much set in stone at this juncture in my life i do nt see myself as a prolife or prochoice supporter and the reason for that is because i kind of agree with both sides on one hand i firmly believe that the destruction of a human being  born or not  is murder it fits the definition  of  murder before you downvote me into oblivion  let me be clear it s not the votes i care about it s that you understand where i m coming from even though i have that belief  i also believe that some people were just not meant to be children but therein lies another debate  why do nt they place it in adoption  because most of the time unwanted children are kept  they re not placed into adoption and when they re kept their chances of being neglected as children  whether it be mentally  emotionally  or physically  rise exponentially i certainly would nt want to have a child and resent it i  do nt  have children because frankly i m mean as a damn snake i do nt see any part of me that could ever have a child and not lose my temper with it and i would nt put a kid through that  because  i  was put through that i would be a horrible parent  anyway  i have a point i swear if you re going to have an abortion  why anesthetize it first  do i believe that it can feel  absolutely  but you re killing it i mean it s not like you re putting it to sleep and saying   here  fight for your life  you re fucking killing it so why have a crisis of conscience about it  again  i m sorry if i offend anyone  that s not my intention i m just a realistic person and it is what it is sugarcoating it does nt change it the bill seems like a waste of time and tax dollars  edit  i do nt understand why this is being downvoted so  please  give me your views instead of leaving me wondering because if there s something i m not understanding it needs to be made clear again this is absolutely not about the votes rather than having a discussion,,

68907,did nt we get rid of debtor s prisons  i m confuse,4,
68908,i believe this happened as i heard this story from other news sources  but some info had to be left out or missing in the us if you owe money on a debt the personcompany has seven years to collect if they do nt the debt disappears if they take you to court and get a judgement they have ten years to collect and it can be renewed for ten more years the only way he could be arrested is if the loan company took him to court  won a judgement and then took further action to force the debtor to court this would not be something to come out of the blue,4,
68909,more from the professional  victim class  i guess you need something to do in between police shootings and sanders rallies,5,

68925,heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off fre,8,
68926,her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui,8,

68936,this is great pr for periscop,1,
68937,driving drunk is not easy,1,
68938,what is 10 day weekend work release,1,
68939,at first i thought this was a reasonable charge  but when i read the article it said that she was actually driving with a flat tire most drunks are smart enough to avoid driving on a flat  this woman is an idiot and deserves a harsh punishment she was intoxicated enough to seriously endanger the lives of others  if an officer had nt pulled her over i m sure she would have caused some serious damage,,
68940,that s cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work releas,,
68941,well it s not like you can prove that she was actually intoxicated  so the fact that she was nt punished seems appropriate,,
68942,and my mom wonders why i m not married,,
68945, every  prepackaged shredded cheese has it it s the most common anticlumping agent used around the world the argument is that the labels said 100  cheese,9,
68946,labels should be accurate end of story if the product inside does not match the label ingredients  it is fraud and should be prosecuted as such,8,
68947,that s why you buy a little wedge of parm and use a microplane grater on it to shave cheese onto your pasta the wedge lasts a very long time  and in the end it s cheaper than the nasty jars,7,
68948,cellulose is the actual substance you ll find it in all pregrated cheeses these guys were just busted putting too much in to save    lettuce is also made of cellulose where commercial outfits get it for cheese  i guess could be just about any plant judged edible  including  sure  trees  also who knows what kind of cheese you re supposedly getting much nicer to get a hunk of the real stuff and a crank grater  my knuckles hate box graters with a passion ,8,
68949,so my penne has wood,8,
68950,so the correct labeling is 92  cheese and 8  wood filler  i think that s right,6,
68951,solution  buy your parmesan  domestic or real  and grate it yourself tastes better too if you re really lazy  grate it and freeze until you need it,7,
68952,damn were becoming like china  next will have faked food,5,
68953,what kind of wood   are we talking the high quality organic stuff  or factory processed scrap wood  because goddamnit if they ve been slipping cheap wood shavings into my welfarecheese  we re going to have an fucking issue on our hands,4,
68954,lol  wood it is cellulose trying to get clicks,6,
68955,i m safe  source  only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti,3,
68956,i shred my own parmesan cheese  it makes worlds differenc,3,
68957,this is why i do nt buy nasty sargento cheese ever taste it  it tastes like wood  i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better,3,
68958,hmm i am pretty sure i misread that title,1,
68959,it s cheaper by the chunk anyways,1,
68960,similar to olive oil  most parmesan cheese is nt even parmesan cheese,1,
68961,my parents always called it cardboard chees,1,
68962,it still taste oh so goooooooood,1,
68963,if it tastes good  i do nt care,1,
68964,pene means weiner in spanish that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood,1,
68965,maybe they are just trying to get people to eat a whole door over the course of a year,1,
68966,just buy the blockwedge and grate your own,1,
68967,gt  she faces up to a year in prison  so  what re you in for blondie    just beat me up and get it over with,1,
68968,cellulose is indeed an anti clumping agent if they use more and it does not change taste  i am ok with it at least it has less calories  ,,
68969,if you buy preshredded or grated cheese  you deserve to eat wood,,
68971,i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic,9,
68972,for those unaware  he is one of the marines who carried sgt major kasal out of the fallujah  hellhouse  it is  in my opinion  one of the most iconic photos of the iraq war this photo  https  iimgurcomtezsn9zjp,9,
68973,i live in dc groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day never makes the news public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do nt know what they are doing worst part it s never anyone who will fight back not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 1315 but they have seriously injured folks in the past brain damage and internal bleeding i typically avoid groups of young black men now i feel a little bad about it like i m being racist but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted,9,
68974,another article with some details  http  dailycallercom20160215marineallegedlyassaultedmidburgeratmcdonaldsasgangyelleddoyoubelieveblacklivesmatte,9,

68976,inb4 this thread gets nuked by the mods,9,
68977,not only did they assault a veteran with a deadly weapon  they used his credit cards at locations should nt be too tough to find them fuck these kids,8,
68978,this is a pretty typical mugging the mugger aggressively asks you a question  and regardless of your answer they either beat you or ask for money sometimes it s shit like  do you care about the homeless   and if you say  yes  then they aggressively ask for money and if you say no they get upset and threaten you and say you are a liar if you say no  they threaten to beat you or they just get violent either way  you are going to end up giving them your walletmoney another common one is asking you for a cigarette if you do nt have any  they will accuse you of having one and not giving it to them because of some stupid reason  racism  greed  etc  and then get aggressive and demand money for a pack of cigarettes whenif you pull out your wallet they will just grab it and walk away or beat you and run  i was on a bus and had a guy ask for my cell phone to make a call  when i said no  he said i was a racist because i assumed he was going to steal it made a big scene and stood up and got in my face and started slapping my head until i gave him the phone then he got off the bus  same principle with this happens all the fucking time if they get caught they usually say shit like  oh he gave it to me  i did nt steal it  scumbags only reason this one made the news is because it was a war vet,9,
68979,pieces of shit who ve done nothing but take from societ,8,
68980,i hope that the assailants rot in prison,7,
68981,from the daily caller article  gt   i believe this was a hate crime and i was targeted because of my skin color   marquez told the dcnf  too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the main stream media refuses to report on it  woah there racist  only black people can be the victim of a hate crime  now take your beating and shut the hell up about these underprivileged disadvantaged teen youths,8,
68982,i m sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case,8,
68983,lock these shitheads up and throw away the ke,8,
68984,black lives do matter these teens  lives  however do not,9,
68985,every fucking time a cop shoots a black guy  justified or not  we have people like obama telling us we have to do some  soul searching  and when cities like dc and baltimore  i live around both and can personally attest that shit like this happens all the time and is usually never reported  and detroit and new york and such have this shit happen  it s a non issue  fuck all of it  trump 201,8,
68986,do white lives matter to blacks,5,
68987,i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold  it s really political blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims  and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws  and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm  how much power do the sjws really have  will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution,8,
68988,and people try to tell me that what celebrities do and say is not important at all on some level  in some instances it is  this is the movement beyonc  tried to shove into everyone s face at the superbowl just remember that,8,
68989,best optionavoid dc because it s a shit hole,7,
68990, across the street from the fbi headquarters,7,
68991, do black lives matter if you do nt agree we ll beat and rob you   and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement,8,
68992,i would like to remind everyone that bernie sanders has aligned himself with and defended the black lives matter movement in many of his speeches he talks about sandra bland  michael brown  eric garner and in typical fashion blames racism and the white establishment sanders never once mentions the blacks that are home invading in indianapolis  kansas city  atlanta  etc he never once talks about the blacks that have shot at and killed police  most recently a 19 year old black man shoots an officer in mississippi black lives matter and politicians like sanders are waging that the future will be less white and in that future you folks can imagine who will be the most vile and racist  edit  from today  white house tweets shoutout to grammy winner of best rap album  still no word on recent spate of cop killing,9,
68993,let s see if this gets labeled as the hate crime it very clearly is  who am i kidding  that wo nt happen,8,
68994,i do not think that black lives matter more than anyone elses if anyone else does  they do nt understand what equality is fuck blm,8,

69000,do black lives matter or do all lives matter,8,
69001,black lives matter  to who,8,
69004,this is why a lot of former cops are setting up companies where they transport the cash for it it s also a huge motivation for the stores to keep 2 separate sets of books  a real one and one the irs gets to see,9,
69005,this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day,9,
69006,gt  one of the three men who escaped from a california jail last month had been charged with kidnapping a marijuana dispensary owner that they suspected had hidden large amounts of cash in the desert the man and his accomplices are accused of driving the dispensary owner out to the desert  torturing him and cutting off his penis  sheesh i m not carrying more than  10 in my wallet from now on  and that has nothing to do with the fact that i m broke,9,
69007,this is why they get robbed all the time out here no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys,7,
69008,ca nt these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us,8,
69009,there s a great documentary on netflix called  high profits  about a business in breckenridge  co right before full legalization took effect  one of the big issues was exactly this only being able to do business in cash from payroll to paying city taxes they had  120k in cash they had to just walk into the front of the city building with and that was just the first month alone  some of the people that make the drops to the shops are walking out with  10k in their pockets and no security at all it s terrifying,8,
69010,civil forfeiture time,6,
69011,ironically  it s also just flat out illegal to own large sums of money anything over a few hundred bucks  and the government can sieze that money  because the money committed the crime of intent to purchase narcotics,9,
69012,time to start using gold,5,
69013,so the tax man will gladly take cannadollars  but the banks will not this is ridiculously stupid,5,
69014,same deal in washington still have to buy my shit with cash oh but i can buy cigs and alcohol with a card no problem  if you want to pick up a gram here or there it s no problem  but i buy in bulk  since it s cheaper that means i need to stop by the bank to get  140 that s the only time i carry that much money on me  it s like requiring a personal check to get a passport no cashier s check  no card wtf it s 2016,7,
69015,are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money,5,
69016,this war on cash is such bullshit  people carried cash until 12 years ago and it was perfectly fine  now they are trying to restrict flying with cash  purchasing with cash  seizing cash   the only problem is that the money is due on one day  they need to have the tax office take payment on any day of the week  so it s stacked,6,
69017,i wonder how negative interest rates  if implemented  would effect the marijuana business these value of the business would probably increase as they had large sums of cash on hand their credit worthiness would increase because they had something of value  cash  but they would be penalized for depositing that cash according to the recent imf working paper i wonder if they would become attractive targets for some banks to help capitalize their weak balance sheets,3,
69018,oh well let you do business  but you just wo nt be able to use any banks what a backwards ass countr,3,
69019,this is a perfect storm for evil doers who seize this unfortunate opportunity all they would have to to do is steak out a caregiver facility i would hope something changes soon this is absurd and the last word of that article  like my post  is penis,3,

69025,bitcoin is the answe,4,
69026,time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins,3,
69027,that  s because it  s cash day at the collection center  when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill  and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot,1,
69028,pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california,1,
69029,its a shame they cant count on the highwayrobber police to guard the money,1,
69030,it looks like they re tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books,1,
69031,this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is,1,
69032,someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy,1,
69033,what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit  checks for those transactions  then just but the trees with the gift certificate,1,
69034,as if the banks do nt take drug money as we speak it is also not like the fbi do nt have cases on going against those banks i really do nt see why there is a problem,1,
69035,can they not employ armored trucks,1,
69036,it s the same way in washington and colorado it s still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed,1,
69037,since the money cant be deposited into a bank would a good option to take be converting it into precious metals such as gold  you would still need to store the gold but that could be easily done in a safety deposit however unless you know where to go  getting that much gold could raise the attention of people you dont want raised to begin with it s not like in china or india  if you show up with a briefcase of cash and walk out with a smaller case of gold  no one really cares,1,
69038,can they print their tax forms using hemp paper  and then turn them into the irs,1,
69039,watch out for that   cop robbery   civil asset forfeiture,1,
69040,so  did anyone else read that article right to the end  the last sentence oof,1,
69041,it would be interesting for all of the companies to announce they were bringing their taxes to the tax office on a particular day let it be known to all criminals in the state i wonder if the state might decide to put some security on the place  then,1,
69042,build your own secure fort no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building,1,
69047,this makes sense a lot of people in science fields relating to cancer formation  such as radiology and medicinal biology  are of the opinion that most cancerous tumors are actually quietly killed by the body before they can reach critical mass to defend themselves  and the ones that prove dangerous are the ones that either do nt register to t cells or which grow too quickly to be snuffed to simplify  the reasons for this are simple  not everyone dies from cancer  and everyone gets exposed to carcinogens given the rate of mutation  the influence of radiation  the amount of background radiation  etc  that everyone is unavoidably exposed to  we should all develop tumors if there is a true casual relationship if you simply say that the body is helpless against them naturally  we would all die from cancer the body  must  be defending itself from them given that we do nt  in fact  it s basically accepted as scientific truth cancer is nt simply the presence of cancerous tumors  it s the presence of cancerous tumors that have the right surrounding cells  in the right quantity  that do nt die from immune system intervention and which have favorable growth conditions most small tumors simply do nt have the right conditions  and die studies have confirmed that the ones that register as cancer are a subset of all tumors that might form  because this subset avoids the usual limiting factors  so  going back to the article  this is simply taking the bodies natural process for fighting tumors and guiding it to specific cancers it might normally miss and saying  go get it   then praying you did nt just kill the poor sap with his now manically overenthusiastic immune system,6,
69048,gt  the treatment involves removing the tcells from patients  tagging them with  receptor  molecules that target cancer  and putting them back into the body in an infusionthe targeting molecules  known as chimeric antigen receptors or cars  came from specially bred genetically engineered mice   gt  in one study  94 percent of participants suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia  all  said their symptoms vanished completely after they were treated with the modified blood cells  known as tcells  it looks like this could be a very  very big deal i m surprised that  as of this comment  this post is not getting much attention,7,
69049,now they just need to find a way to reverse liver cirrhosis and i can live forever,1,
69050,this is a breakthrough right up until the pharmaceutical companies buy the process and tuck it away forever  there s no money to be made in curing a disease,1,
69051,i m rather hopeful that we ll be able to cure most cancers within the next 20 years or so  and hopefully before that we ll have something that wo nt cure it but will reliably halt cancer so that a patient can just wait for the actual cure to be found  as with we do with hiv i believe  maybe i m being too optimistic  but you got ta be optimistic about something in this miserable world,1,

69055,i have been calling the helpline everyday for 2 weeks it is a recorded message saying call back later we are busy just then general va helpline,8,
69056,the problem with the va  like most other government agencies  is that there is no accountability when you ca nt fire workers who are lazy  negligent  or worthless  you end up with a disfunctional organization filled with lazy  negligent  and worthless people,7,
69057,yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country,4,
69058,i have a pretty easy solution  why do nt overflow suicide calls just get forwarded to the regular suicide hotline  s   sure its probably better to deal with someone specifically trained to deal with service men and women but anyone is better then a voicemail,5,
69059,that vm box is gon na get overloaded quic,3,
69060,pissing off trained military personnel seems like a dumb idea in the long ru,3,

69102,the only relevance to crime is the idea itself scam to grab more control of your money  bankster shenanigans do nt fall for it,3,
69103,the banks love this this means less people holding cash and more money that they can use to fuck us over remember folks  the rules are changing so that the money on deposit with banks is legally not yours if there s a bank failure  your money will be used to bail out the banks  the move is simply an extension of the war on cash,3,
69104,the fed stopped printing any bills higher than  100 in 1945 they began destroying the larger denominations actively in 1969  100 in 1945 is equivalent to  1300 today adjusting for inflation frankly they should be talking about issuing a  200 and  500 bill  if not also a  1000 bill,3,
69105,larry summers should be in prison  he is one of the architects of the 2008 collapse he also was instrumental in the repeal of glasssteagall the world would be better off without this fool and his dangerous ideas  http  wwwsourcewatchorgindexphp  title  larry_summer,3,
69106,does larry mean wall st criminals  of course not  white male entitlement it s what larry is all about unfortunately obama was dumb enough to bring summers into his administration where he flailed about  lamely attempting to cover upmake excuses as to why the theater burned down in 2008 with the financial  masters of the universe  still inside  larry proved his overall dumbness by predicting 2011 would be  recovery summer   based on nothing  no evidence just his  expert  opinion  there was no recovery in 2011,3,

69110,just legalize crime everybody wins,4,
69111,fuk this illuminati puppe,3,
69112,the bulk of the value of cash in circulation is from  100 s get rid of cash and the fed can do any crazy policy it wants this is a necessary step towards negative interest rates nobody believes the government gives two shits about money laundering  florida real estate laws and hsbc getting zero criminal charges shows that is not the case,4,
69113,banksters do nt even use cash oh wait you re talking about the little criminals carry on,5,
69114,another attempt by the wealthy to outlaw cash our money is nt our money  according to the elite,5,
69115,then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination ,3,
69116,scrap the two  the single  the penny  half dollar and nickel instead,3,
69117,scrap the drugs too  make them illegal  oh wait,1,

69120,interning theory main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks,1,
69121,singapore has had the 10000 singapore dollar bill for some time it is still legal tender  but is going to be phased out slowly old notes will not be replaced  this is a calculated strategy by the sg government to comply with international counterterrorism and anti money laundering efforts  but minimising their own vulnerability to regulatory arbitrage,1,
69122,is nt the  100 bill the staple of american foreign trade  i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like  interestfree  loans  though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ,1,
69123,politicians do nt use  100s so how could it harm criminals,1,
69124,what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then,1,
69125,gt  the  100 bill is actually the second most common us bill in circulation  behind the  1 bill  gt  nearly 80  of the  14 trillion of us currency in circulation is in  100 bills much of it is held outside the united states  i m no math magician  but this does nt seem to fit,1,
69126,yeah  just watch  they will scrap it right down to the 20  anyone who wants to make largeish purchases will have to use electronic accounts that can be tracked  oh yeah   because crime  not  because government needs to track your every move,1,
69127,this is one of those ideas that seems silly at first but the more you think of it  the more it makes some sense,1,
69128,this is stupid  criminals will make due with what ever currency there is  they do nt fucking care and any one who thinks otherwise is a desk jocky looking for something to do,1,
69129,switch to all coins while you re at it if  100 weighed an ounce   1600 would weigh a pound  1 mil would weigh 625 lbs,1,
69130,larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone,1,
69131,how would this effect the bitcoin market,1,
69132,this is about getting rid of cash  not making life tougher for criminals that way  when the fed institutes negative interest rates  you the lowly consumer will be forced to spend your savings to avoid being charged for saving,1,
69133,funny thing  today also the eu central bank ceo emanuele prodi announced that 500 euro bills are to be outphased for the same reason apparently american criminals manage to launder money with a bill that s 6 times less in value  is nt this just a global banking scheme to rob us the power over our own money,1,
69134,yes those evil people in government would love to get rid of cash and make everyone just use electronic money because then  the bank has your money and you only have an iou which they may  or may not  pay you back in the future  look at cyprus in 2013 where people did nt get their full deposited funds back because of the financial crisis  also they can charge you negative interest rateswhich means you have to pay for the bank to hold your funds  and of course if the govt has your money  then they have a great deal more power over you in deciding whether they should be nice and give it back to you or not  this is another reason why bitcoin is good  although they will ban that long before they ban cash,1,
69135,now  whatchall wan na do  wan na be ballers  shotcallers  brawlers  who be dippin in the benz wit tha spawlers,,
69136,hmm sounds like portable bitcoin exchange devices would be cool carry a bitcoin wallet in a little  5 raspberry pilike thing with an lcd display  hook it up to another  punch in transfer codes  both devices show  are you sure   both people hit yes  see the verification displayed  and bill sizes become irrelevant and everybody can keep negotiating with cash when buying motorcycles off craigslist no matter what these control freak asshats try to pull,,
69137,you can still buy silver and gold anonymously  and cash out up to  1500 worth at one time with no tax penalty,,
69138,but  but  how will weezy and drizzy write raps now if they ca nt talk about dem big faces,,
69141,just in time for the marijuana legalization bill this november,7,
69142,arizona   republican   legislators want to subvert the will of the people ftf,7,
69143,sounds reasonable to me  more easily  is such a loaded headline current law states ballot measures need 34th of both chambers of legislature to overturn ballot measures no matter how narrowly they pass mesnard wants to amend the law so that the amount needed to overturn is proportional to the margin the measure passed  people want to sit here and think this is some republican ploy on the grounds of marijuana measures  but what happens if some sleazy right wing john kavanagh inspired measure gets through at 51   there are certainly 15 az senators who ll support it and thus it ca nt be changed  this bill gives parity to both sides of the aisle,,
69145,the county commissioner who spearheaded the public sales tax for the bengals and reds stadia now works for the bengals,9,
69146,let the  14 dollar beer flow,8,
69147,corruption of public officials in michigan  no way,9,
69148,i certainly do nt necessarily agree with public funds being used for a sports stadium  and i definitely do nt agree with nepotism  but i think criticizing mike illitch somehow taking advantage of detroit is a shortsighted mistake had it not been for mr illitch pretty much singlehandily reinvesting in a city everyone wanted to leave behind over the last 20 years  the city would nt even be close to back on a path to relevancy  whether you want to believe it is or not   the other thing to consider is that this new complex not only brings commerce to an area that was a combination of blight and open fields  it also brings quite a few jobs to the city  as well as some stateoftheart buildings that will bring commerce and international travelers to the area for a variety of reasons  conferences  concerts  etc   this all equals more money for the city of detroit  which is why they re willing to make the investment in the first place   and another part of a blightfilled neighborhood updated and usable for the future  this is a sticky situation that reeks of an unfortunate quidproquo  but when it comes to what is good for the city of detroit  it s hard to argue that anyone has anything on the passion and dedication of mike illitch,9,
69149,how in the fuck are there no comments about the red wings owner s hair  ,9,
69150,everyone talks about the insanity in pro sports these days  yet no one mentions  public or private  universities  which are all nonprofit  spending massive amounts of their cash on stadiums  athletic facilities  etc it s the same thing if the universities are public  and its only marginally different if they re private the reason they have that money in the first place is federallysubsidized student loans,8,
69151,lol illitch has done more for the city of detroit than any other person in the last 50 years fuck off,9,
69152,so he did a good job for the team and the owner offered him more money for a better job  happens all the time  kids,6,
69153,is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit  or ford field  most people would not step foot downtown if it was nt for those two places i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do nt bring forth revitalization like intendedbut the only article i ve read was about stadiums in la and sf,6,
69154,before you jump on the  why ca nt detroit use the money for things that actually matter  train   here s   http  wwwcrainsdetroitcomarticle20140921news309219990oncostfinancingofwingsarenahereareanswers  an article outlining the finances of this massive project  edit  s  for those not wanting to click  gt  the initial base price is  450 million problems  changes and added amenities could increase that final cost anything beyond  450 million must be paid by the ilitches  gt  the michigan strategic fund will sell  450 million in two series of bonds they will be divided into  250 million in series a bonds that will be backed by property taxes already captured by the downtown development authority the  200 million in series b bonds will be backed by the  115 million olympia development has agreed to pay the dda for bond retirement  gt  the ilitches  through olympia  will pay  200 million of the bond debt detroit s dda  via its property tax capture ability  will pay back  250 million of the bonds new yorkbased merrill lynch  a division of bank of america  which has pledged to buy all the publicly backed series a bonds in the deal it will then sell the bonds to the public dallasbased comerica bank inc will buy the series b bonds backed by olympia s money the bank  formerly based in detroit  has the naming rights to comerica park  where the ilitchowned detroit tigers play comerica intends to keep the bonds on its books rather then sell them,8,
69155, misleading title   https  wwwredditcomrhockeycomments45xs0mdetroit_contractor_who_negotiated_285_million_ind00vnke   it was state money  not detroit s also  ilitch footed most of the bill himself  or through his company   please research  the district  and see their plans for it before passing judgement,9,
69156,clickbait no one around here is remotely upset about taxpayer funds going to a new stadium for the most popular team in town we re not really unhappy about the new development for business and residences that is happening and we re not raising any concerns about the effort to revitalize the city  detroit is climbing out of a hole created by the corruption of influential individuals local business and leaders have been more beneficial in this process than any other group and this stadium  and the district surrounding it are seen as victories in this effort,8,
69157,ah  a local spin on the old  congressperson becomes lobbyist  setup,3,
69158,they are literally building new district for the city not just an arena  a whole new district development is what the city needs and frankly  detroit politics have always been just a  wee  bit corrup,4,
69159,but  guys  come on we need our circuses  what would we do with out national sports  concentrate on real issues  lol  that s no fun ,4,
69160,at ohio state  the man whole negotiated the deal to sell its parking rights to a private company  campusparc  left to work for them after it was signed,4,
69161,you think that s a wig,4,
69162,public money should never be allowed to pay for sports teams unless the team has to pay back the city directly  with interest none of this but businesses will benefit  bullsht it s my fucking money you re stealing  i do nt want to  potentially  subsidize businesses downtown,8,
69163,if you re a bernie supporter  who thinks a public funded  1 trillion dollar infrastructure package is a good deal because jobs  but is outraged by the state of michigan investing  285 million in the renovationrevitalization of its  largest city  then you might want to reexamine one of those positions,6,
69164,for all the people complaining about spending the money on the new stadium and  less mentioned  surrounding developments  all i can say is it will be more than worth it if it fixes up that area governments of all levels have been dumping money into the cass corridor since the early days of johnson s great society programs with any luck this will finally be a solution that stick,7,
69165,itt  out of staters have no fucking idea about the current state of economics in detroit and how great this project is going to be for the city  i do nt even know where to begin with this article it s clear the author did nt talk to a single person in the city or state or even try to get a feel for the public opinion on the topic including garbage clickbait phrases like the previous article titled  detroit scam city  how the red wings took hockeytown for all it had  has to be one of the dumbest fucking things i ve ever read  when detroit was at its absolute rock bottom worst  going to joe louis arena was probably the only reason suburban white people would ever go into the city and spend money now mike ilitch wants to build a gigantic urban development project including restaurants  shopping stores    apartment complexes   and oh yeah a brand new stateoftheart arena for one of the most successful hockey teams of all time  they have nt missed the playoffs since before i was born  25 years ago they are a big deal and have been for decades   oh  and it s being built at the exact time there s an influx of young people and new businesses into the the city which will create more upward momentum  yes  the city is helping pay for it the city also got a lot of input on it design  layout  and what additional projects would be built along with the arena this happens in every single city an arenastadium is built i do nt necessarily think that s how it should work but the fact of the matter is that this is how these deals are made and the city absolutely needs projects like this if it wants to continue on its upward trend  also attacks on mike ilitch in this article and this thread are disgusting illitch has been a controversial figure for a long time but his story is like example of the american dream you d see in fiction his parents were poor immigrants  he grew up in detroit joined the marines played minor league baseball for the team he now owns opens up a mom and pop pizza place and creates an empire out of it  gets rich while creating jobs and doing public works projects for the city he grew up in even though it s a complete shit hole mike ilitch has been spending  and yes  making  money in detroit for years mike ilitch was there in the 90 s and early 00 s before there was ever a housing crash in the rest of the country the man is nt a saint but if it were nt for him there would be a lot less charities and projects being invested in now he wants to build a project the city desperately needs with the city s help and input  and he s getting shit on by some dumb ass  journalist  that ca nt get their facts straight  endran,7,

69211,scrap larry summers  and get rid of a criminal,3,
69212,the only relevance to crime is the idea itself scam to grab more control of your money  bankster shenanigans do nt fall for it,3,
69213,the banks love this this means less people holding cash and more money that they can use to fuck us over remember folks  the rules are changing so that the money on deposit with banks is legally not yours if there s a bank failure  your money will be used to bail out the banks  the move is simply an extension of the war on cash,3,
69214,the fed stopped printing any bills higher than  100 in 1945 they began destroying the larger denominations actively in 1969  100 in 1945 is equivalent to  1300 today adjusting for inflation frankly they should be talking about issuing a  200 and  500 bill  if not also a  1000 bill,3,
69215,larry summers should be in prison  he is one of the architects of the 2008 collapse he also was instrumental in the repeal of glasssteagall the world would be better off without this fool and his dangerous ideas  http  wwwsourcewatchorgindexphp  title  larry_summer,3,
69216,does larry mean wall st criminals  of course not  white male entitlement it s what larry is all about unfortunately obama was dumb enough to bring summers into his administration where he flailed about  lamely attempting to cover upmake excuses as to why the theater burned down in 2008 with the financial  masters of the universe  still inside  larry proved his overall dumbness by predicting 2011 would be  recovery summer   based on nothing  no evidence just his  expert  opinion  there was no recovery in 2011,3,
69217,bring back the  500 and  1000 dollar bills dammit,3,
69218,larry summers  ladies and gentlemen one of the masterminds of financial deregulation is now proposing another hair brained idea summers  go clone yourself so you can go fuck yourself,3,
69219,attention  we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash  except pennies   cash is privacy and should be a basic right,1,
69220,just legalize crime everybody wins,4,
69221,fuk this illuminati puppe,3,
69222,the bulk of the value of cash in circulation is from  100 s get rid of cash and the fed can do any crazy policy it wants this is a necessary step towards negative interest rates nobody believes the government gives two shits about money laundering  florida real estate laws and hsbc getting zero criminal charges shows that is not the case,4,
69223,banksters do nt even use cash oh wait you re talking about the little criminals carry on,5,
69224,another attempt by the wealthy to outlaw cash our money is nt our money  according to the elite,5,
69225,then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination ,3,
69226,scrap the two  the single  the penny  half dollar and nickel instead,3,
69227,scrap the drugs too  make them illegal  oh wait,1,
69228,but they just click buttons on a computer and create and move money around  wait  what,1,
69229,than how will our government and cia function,1,
69230,interning theory main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks,1,
69231,singapore has had the 10000 singapore dollar bill for some time it is still legal tender  but is going to be phased out slowly old notes will not be replaced  this is a calculated strategy by the sg government to comply with international counterterrorism and anti money laundering efforts  but minimising their own vulnerability to regulatory arbitrage,1,
69232,is nt the  100 bill the staple of american foreign trade  i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like  interestfree  loans  though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ,1,
69233,politicians do nt use  100s so how could it harm criminals,1,
69234,what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then,1,
69235,gt  the  100 bill is actually the second most common us bill in circulation  behind the  1 bill  gt  nearly 80  of the  14 trillion of us currency in circulation is in  100 bills much of it is held outside the united states  i m no math magician  but this does nt seem to fit,1,
69236,yeah  just watch  they will scrap it right down to the 20  anyone who wants to make largeish purchases will have to use electronic accounts that can be tracked  oh yeah   because crime  not  because government needs to track your every move,1,
69237,this is one of those ideas that seems silly at first but the more you think of it  the more it makes some sense,1,
69238,this is stupid  criminals will make due with what ever currency there is  they do nt fucking care and any one who thinks otherwise is a desk jocky looking for something to do,1,
69239,switch to all coins while you re at it if  100 weighed an ounce   1600 would weigh a pound  1 mil would weigh 625 lbs,1,
69240,larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone,1,
69241,how would this effect the bitcoin market,1,
69242,this is about getting rid of cash  not making life tougher for criminals that way  when the fed institutes negative interest rates  you the lowly consumer will be forced to spend your savings to avoid being charged for saving,1,
69243,funny thing  today also the eu central bank ceo emanuele prodi announced that 500 euro bills are to be outphased for the same reason apparently american criminals manage to launder money with a bill that s 6 times less in value  is nt this just a global banking scheme to rob us the power over our own money,1,
69244,yes those evil people in government would love to get rid of cash and make everyone just use electronic money because then  the bank has your money and you only have an iou which they may  or may not  pay you back in the future  look at cyprus in 2013 where people did nt get their full deposited funds back because of the financial crisis  also they can charge you negative interest rateswhich means you have to pay for the bank to hold your funds  and of course if the govt has your money  then they have a great deal more power over you in deciding whether they should be nice and give it back to you or not  this is another reason why bitcoin is good  although they will ban that long before they ban cash,1,
69245,now  whatchall wan na do  wan na be ballers  shotcallers  brawlers  who be dippin in the benz wit tha spawlers,,
69246,hmm sounds like portable bitcoin exchange devices would be cool carry a bitcoin wallet in a little  5 raspberry pilike thing with an lcd display  hook it up to another  punch in transfer codes  both devices show  are you sure   both people hit yes  see the verification displayed  and bill sizes become irrelevant and everybody can keep negotiating with cash when buying motorcycles off craigslist no matter what these control freak asshats try to pull,,
69247,you can still buy silver and gold anonymously  and cash out up to  1500 worth at one time with no tax penalty,,
69248,but  but  how will weezy and drizzy write raps now if they ca nt talk about dem big faces,,
69250,i lived 200yds from a burn pit when i was there in 04 i had some skin disease for about 2 years after iraq and some kind of asthma the va did nt give a shit then and they still do nt care  so  i got that goin for me,9,
69251,i was in tikrit  cob speicher  from 08 to 09 i lived a few hundred feet from the  burn pit  it was basically a huge junk yard with 3 huge constantly burning rectangular pits they were about 75 feet long and 50 feet across iirc you could see black or white smoke billowing from the area all the time i had to go there at least once a week to dump trash imagine standing over a red hot fire throwing junk off the back of a flatbed truck while it was 130 degrees outside sometimes the smog was so thick driving through the junk yard  that you could nt see 50 feet in front of you the smoke would almost always linger around the base and it smelled awful olfactory fatigue did not apply here it always smelled no matter how long you d be  exposed  you never got used to it never mind that they burned our shit right next door i remember one day we had to do a pt test the 2 mile run was on the same road as the burn pit smoke everywhere nobody passed that day some people were puking at the end i usually ran a 13  45 2 mile and i remember getting over 17 minutes i was gasping for air at the end we all thought the course was marked out incorrectly  but when we measured it later that day it was exactly 2 miles needless to say  nobody ever had any respiratory protection around these things  ever nor were we ever told we needed them i mean we had our gas masks in our gear  but nobody wanted to be  that guy  damn  we used to joke about it all the time whenever someone would start spewing some  war story   or when some freshoutabasic private would try to tell us about  that one time my drill sergeant made us do this  story   at the end we d say   yeah  but have you ever been to the burn pit    then we d laugh it off i guess it s not so funny anymore,8,
69252,my husband  half  jokes about the cancer he s going to get from the burn pits in afghanistan from what he described  they were horrible,8,
69253,this hits close to home we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight i really need to get this checked out,7,
69254,i can understand why burning trash and human waste may be unavoidable in certain military circumstances like in those remote outposts in afghanistan that might house 1520 people  there really are nt any good alternatives  however it seems less defensible to not have invested in better infrastructure once you had permanent bases the size of small cities  once you re at the point where soldiers had their own little airconditioned houses made out of cargo containers with air conditioning  satellite television  and onbase burger king it seems like you can probably invest in some proper trash incinerators instead of open burn pits,7,
69255,gt  though the us government disputes it well  color me surprised,8,
69256,a tsgt i know died recently from cancer he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family he was 32 his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer,7,
69257, support our troops with a ribbon sticker   that will definitely make up for all the fucked up shit the government puts them through,7,
69258,not surprised saw a guy in the va who used to jog through the base with his unitteam  not sure of the terminology   breathing in the smoke from one of these every day for 4 years he had some chronic lung condition we were working up  and said a couple of his buddies also have lung problems now otherwise perfectly healthy 40 years old  completely unnecessary illness due to stupidity andor apathy,6,
69259,http  wwwpublichealthvagovexposurescamplejeune for decades  the government knowingly allowed service members and their dependents to consume contaminated tap water fifteen diseases are recognized to have a direct relation to the contamination but many more are cropping up yet the government wo nt recognize those  yet   and they re filing motions to have claims tossed out based on statute of limitations  even though the government did nt even announce the contamination until over a decade after the wells were closed  this is nt just an agent orange or iraq war contamination where soldiers were exposed and have problems babies born at the base hospital hadhave an alarmingly high rate of birth defects but nothing is being done about it and the va continues to deny claims we ll just go ahead and add this one to the list,6,
69260,uhh i ve had a severe cough for 34 years now  since coming back from afghanistan  it ll get so bad  that i ll cough until i throw up  and then cough more  the va said it was normal i m sure they know what they re talking about i feel fine,6,
69261,i remember having to sit through a 2 hour briefing the first week i arrived in iraq  back in 2008 we were told that scientists verified that the burn pit on base was not a detriment to our health  then we had to sign forms when i returned stateside  there were quite a few reports of people having respiratory issues after returning from deployment  the va also denied that any illnesses were related to desert storm it took a long time for anyone other than veterans to admit that desert storm syndrome was a real thing  and then said veterans had to go through the gauntlet of proving their illnesses were related to their deployment,6,
69262,goddamn  it s unbelievable the way vets are treated shame,6,
69263,government does nt give a fuck about veterans,6,
69264,my 36yo buddy was just diagnosed with nonhodgkens lymphoma when he visited the va to do the paperwork they asked what bases he served at overseas  and literally had a list of diseases to reference per base just got a  yep  here it is probably from the burn pit  from the clerk thumbing down the list when he told me i was blown away  why is nt there any followup with soldiers who served at these bases    even a simple  you may want to get screened  when he returned from service would have given us some hope of getting in front of it it s incredibly irritating,6,
69265,the us lying about iraq and afghanistan  nah  never happen,7,
69266,do nt worry guys we ll take care of your medical needs when you come home oh wait,5,
69267,do nt forget area 51 they had burn pits like you would nt believe stealth materiels that had top secret components in them the poor guys that were exposed to all of this could nt even go for help  many died in secrecy  i know i was exposed to vaporized depleted uranium and who knows what else i have a sort of bet with my self that i ll die an early death,5,
69268,so  the dod did nt learn any lessons from previous burn pits  i mean  when you have to declassify area 51 because of workers health decline due to burn pits  you d think you d remember this shit is wrong,5,
69269, though he returned home safely in september 2009  he woke up one day a few months later with an inexplicable headache  numbness in his limbs and paralysis on one side of his body beau had suffered a mild stroke his health deteriorated  and he was diagnosed with brain cancer less than two years later  he died at the age of 46  holy fuck    fuck wars and politicians that start them,5,
69270,the us govt so cares about its troops,7,
69271,i ve known military to have permanent letters added to their medical records saying they have been exposed to the worst man made hazarddisaster since chernobyl,4,
69272,does kaf still have the shit pond  on another note  im going to have this checked out the va has this on their website somewhere  they sent an email,4,
69273,there are so many things wrong with this i do nt even know what to say  let s just purposefully burn hazardous material  petroleum products  chemicals  and batteries next to our camp oh  and throw some explosives in there while you re at it and vaporizes all that shit so we can breath it in are you kidding me,4,
69274,holy shit  my friend who was on the poop burning detail a bunch of times died of throat cancer earlier this year my first thought was it was the poop burning that did it  and i m concerned as well because i did my fair share of that as well,4,
69275,where we lived there was a burn pit that was nearby and the smoke would always float over to where we were  as of yet i dont have any symptoms but i do have a begine growth in my head  i have had it checked but i am paranoid that it could become bad ,4,
69276,little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did nt have to bother to actually lob chemicalbio weapons at us we d send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chembio bomb themselves  did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney,4,
69277,every time i allow myself a shred of regret for not enlisting  i remind myself that this kind of shit is what the us does to its soldiers fuck that i respect your service and all that  but fuck that shit,1,
69278,every goddamn war the military has to do something that exposes troops to dangerous chemicals,3,
69279,makes me wonder  i was at camp addertallil back in 2010  2011  what was i exposed to,3,
69280,i was in taji in 2011 2 people got cancer after our deployment  lots of people were having breathing problems we were right next to the tank graveyard and the burn pit was constantly going in our rush to shut down theater i ve gotten lung infections every year since then,3,
69281,just like at area 51  same shit never changes,3,

69289,my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well,1,
69290,that was one messy cakewalk,4,
69291,they should turn on the masters and their supporters,3,
69292,so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them,3,
69293,i thought iraq did nt have wmd s,3,
69294,be sure and vote gop they re the gift that keeps on giving   you give cancer to the army you have  not the army you wish you had,1,
69295,such a simple solution  rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacement,,
69296,am i the only one who read that at first as burn pit bulls,,
69298,hibner is especially surprised it happened in the gym  where the floor is just 15 years old  he said gt   i just think sometimes strange things happen and there s no explanation for the phenomena  even though it was a scary situation for players and parents  he said the girl who was injured is expected to be ready to play in the near future,7,
69299, impaled  sounds about as much of an overstatement as  got a splinter  would be an understatement in this case,7,
69300,gt   i  ve got a tournament here in two weeks  and i have every belief that we  ll be playing on this court that as well   hibner said  or you could put your petty shit on the backburner and ensure the safety of kids by paying for a structural analysis,3,
69301,scott walker will fix it if there s any money in it for him or his buddies  right  wisconsin  aka the louisiana of the north,3,
69302,they need to have an official inspection of the floor  not just parent volunteers,1,
69303,she should sue the schoo,,
69311,colleges really need to stop expelling students due to these kangaroo courts  i m fine with them if it s from breaking a school infraction like alcohol on a dry campus or something of that sort but  if a student is accused of a criminal offense  let the courts deal with it and decide from there  schools are nt equipped to deal with these kinds of cases  nor should they be expected to be these are lifechanging accusations and need to be treated as such  for the benefit of both parties involved,9,
69312,gt  ut investigators later decided  that the evidence supported a finding that  he  had sexually assaulted ms roe  the opposite of the conclusion reached by the more experienced detectives of the police department   the lawsuit says the dean of students then recommended he be expelled  ah but the police are looking for evidence that he did it  college tribunals assume he did and require he provide evidence that he did nt  which  typically  the accused is not allowed to present,9,
69313,gt  one plaintiff is a 24yearold recent graduate  the other is a 21yearold student who is one semester away from graduating with a bachelor  s degree in physics  their lawsuits say   in the graduate  s case  he faces being banned from any ut system campus  being denied a shot at a ut graduate degree and having a notation put on his transcript   the undergrad faces expulsion in addition to the same punishments  that does nt make any sense to me why would an institution retroactively amend the transcript of someone  who already graduated  to say this person violated school policy  after graduating   this seems to be more evidence that they re trying to scapegoat the plaintiffs here i mean  if they were concerned with the alleged victim s wellbeing more than trying to look  tough on sexual assault   what is the point of amending the transcript,9,
69314,who s the idiot who decided that kangaroo courts were a good idea,9,
69315,are we to the point where  sexual assaultrape  almost no longer have a meaning    you getting hammered and hooking up with a hammered guy is not rape  nor is it assault he should sue her for the exact same thing,8,
69316,i once saw a swedish movie called ondskan   evil  that drove me to become a lawyer today  here  https  enwikipediaorgwikievil_  2003_film   plot one of the key issues that caught my attention in this movie is the disregard of the law the school had to the protagonist s rights when he hired a lawyer  because of some grievance he had with the school  it backed off immediatly when the lawyer lay down the letter of the law to the headmaster of that educational institution in front of all his guests  in this university of texas sexual assault case  i believe imhlo  l is for legal   that the constitution sets a foundation of rules for everyone inside it s jurisdiction  and no internal policy that ut may have can go against the rules set by the us constitution everyone should enjoy the right of being innocent until proven guilty  and time and time again people are being layed off their jobs  students expelled  lives ruined because of yettobeproven  accusations  the right thing that any institution  like ut  should always do is address all cases of criminal behavior by always recognizing first the accused innocence until proven guilty in a court of law  edit  grammar,8,
69317,gt  the friend said she thought the woman was conscious because  when she saw her kissing this man  she was awake and talking  the lawsuit says  so intentionally or not the woman who claimed to be assaulted is not telling the truth  editand they decided to expel him without even talking to the student his first chance to give his side was an appeal for his expulsion this is a fucking kangaroo court  edit2  the second lawsuit claims expulsion against a student was recommended without the alleged victim ever personally making a sex assault accusation  http  kxancom20160205lawsuitsagainstutallegebiasagainstmalesinsexassaultcase,9,
69318,gt  the undergrad  s lawsuit says he had sex with a woman who was not a ut student after leaving a house party near campus sometime after midnight on march 6  2015 about a month later  the woman  s father called ut police and accused the man of sexually assaulting his daughter  fuck this i understand that if a woman is  actually  rapedmolestedassaulted it could be hard to come forward  but waiting a month or longer and  then  reporting it is bullshit you get raped  you report it immediately the longer you wait  the more i m going to doubt your accusation,7,
69319,gt  university police never spoke to the woman the undergrad was accused of assaulting and no criminal charges were ever pursued  his lawsuit says the father  s report was referred to the ut dean of students  okay what the hell  seriously  though its this sort of thing that makes me really hate schools handling sexual assault cases on their own the police did nt even talk to the accused victim  but decided to tell the dean instead  it feels like it happens all the time when we have these alternate systems of punishment we stop treating crimes like crimes and treat them like rule infractions a rule infraction is cheating on a test an alleged assault is a crime treat it like one,7,
69320,eli5 kangaroo courts thanks,8,
69321,activist administrators  check lack of due process  check prohibited from legal council or cross examination of the accuser  check nothin to see here  move along people,6,
69322,well  they are probably right these school kangaroo courts have demonstrated they have no respect for the privacy and rights of the accused  and are only interested in demonstrating how seriously they take sexual assault accusations,6,
69323,male privilege,8,
69324,the real lesson here is do nt trust anyone i certainly do nt anymore,6,
69325,reddit is nt okay with witch hunts  but the university of texas and 1600s salem encourage them,7,
69326,stay away from liberal colleges  they are cesspools of tumblrina ideals  i could barely stand the required diversity classes from my public university nothing but priviledge  patriarchy  and man hatin,8,
69327,it seems to me that a public institution has to follow the sixth amendment  which grants  the right to a public trial without unnecessary delay  the right to a lawyer  the right to an impartial jury  and the right to know who your accusers are and the nature of the charges and evidence against you,6,
69328,jane roe because jane doe would be incest,4,
69329,so these students that are expelled do they have to still pay back their loans even though they do nt get a degree now and can they carry their credits over to another school or are they now worthless,5,
69330,i love how at the end she implies that if there were a person punching people randomly on campus they would choose to not involve the police presumably so that the assault victims could  control their own destiny,3,
69331,30 year old here  and planning on returning to school with all this insanity about social values exploding everywhere  i may just hold off a few more years and wait for school to become a profitable idea again,3,
69332,gt  the university has been placed under enormous political pressure to appear tough on those accused of sexual assault  there s your problem right there how about be tough on those convicted of sexual assault and those whom the law decides are innocent be treated as such,3,
69333,umso expel the drunken slut too  right  i could get behind that they both got drunk and made bad choices that reflect poorly on the school kick em both out  why only the male  did he conspire in some way to get her drunk  if they re both adults that got drunk and fucked then they re both equally guilty,7,
69334,considering that almost every case of a rape accusation that s come out massively public has been shown to be fraudulent  i m reserving judgement on this one,3,
69335, ut investigates more than 100 allegations of sexual assault a year  and that number is growing  liebman said   how the hell are there hundreds of allegations a year that s insane this reminds me of the play the crucible  i saw you with the devilcommunistscapitalists  homo raptorus,1,
69336,damned if you do damned if you dont,1,
69337,seems like the girl was so hammered that she could nt remember the sex figured it would be less shameful if she accused him of assault,1,
69340,as a disgusting crime as this is  i do hope real investigative work ishas been done children are easily led and will answer questions often the way the interviewer asks it i remember a daycare couple who had a witchhunt waged against them  almost running their lives because the parents just knew they had to had been molesting their kids then they would ask the kids did mr x touch you there and the kids would say yes,9,
69341,at least the article refers to this as a rape  rather than a  relationship  or  incident  like lots of others do,8,
69342,why does the stock image of a gavel have a link to buy it printed on a mug  like  is anyone going to read this article and be all like  that s a nice gavel picture  i d like to drink coffee out of it ,6,
69343,do nt witch hunt this woman deserves a fair trial you ca nt always believe the stuff that comes out of a child,9,
69344,i ca nt even imagine how messed up in the brain you have to be to do something like this i hope the boy can get past this and recover thoughts and prayers to him and his family   stay strong buddy,8,
69345,i always wonder what the fuck is going through people s head when they do this 7 year olds just are nt attractive they re cute  they incite caring instincts  they do  not  incite sexual feelings what has to be wrong with you to feel that,8,
69346,sentenced to 20 dollar fine,5,
69347,i m more disgusted with argusleadercom i mean seriously  how many hoops do you want a person to jump through to see the text on your shitty little page  close the subscription popup  close the social media slider  what s this google survey popup that renders all of the text as underscores until you fill it out  nope fuck you  your story  and your webpage,8,
69348,i am confident that six months of probation she will receive will be difficult for her ,9,
69349,i ca nt fucking believe the people posting here defending this woman in a reversed situation there d just be people calling for his head and wishing he get killed in prison instead we re treated to people trying to find some way to defend or deflect the situation  wtf a boy gets raped and people think what   hurr well maybe he did it ,7,
69350,but women cant rape men,1,

69354,if the victim was 14  the jury would be hung  as the victim is actually way below the age of puberty  she ll be fried,5,
69355,holy crap  they actually called it rape,6,
69356,i do nt understand  i thought women could nt do this  maybe those college classes on how not to rape should include women,6,
69357,not one comment about how she should be killed or have a train run on her in prison double standards so glaring it s like staring at the su,5,
69358,women dont go to jail as much as men for the same crime it s disgustin,6,
69359,judge is going to come down on her hard with 6 months probation i guarantee,4,

69374,as a disgusting crime as this is  i do hope real investigative work ishas been done children are easily led and will answer questions often the way the interviewer asks it i remember a daycare couple who had a witchhunt waged against them  almost running their lives because the parents just knew they had to had been molesting their kids then they would ask the kids did mr x touch you there and the kids would say yes,9,
69375,at least the article refers to this as a rape  rather than a  relationship  or  incident  like lots of others do,8,
69376,why does the stock image of a gavel have a link to buy it printed on a mug  like  is anyone going to read this article and be all like  that s a nice gavel picture  i d like to drink coffee out of it ,6,
69377,do nt witch hunt this woman deserves a fair trial you ca nt always believe the stuff that comes out of a child,9,
69378,i ca nt even imagine how messed up in the brain you have to be to do something like this i hope the boy can get past this and recover thoughts and prayers to him and his family   stay strong buddy,8,
69379,i always wonder what the fuck is going through people s head when they do this 7 year olds just are nt attractive they re cute  they incite caring instincts  they do  not  incite sexual feelings what has to be wrong with you to feel that,8,

69382,i am confident that six months of probation she will receive will be difficult for her ,9,
69383,i ca nt fucking believe the people posting here defending this woman in a reversed situation there d just be people calling for his head and wishing he get killed in prison instead we re treated to people trying to find some way to defend or deflect the situation  wtf a boy gets raped and people think what   hurr well maybe he did it ,7,
69384,but women cant rape men,1,
69385,if she only waited five more years in some states they would sentence that 12 year old to child support payments,7,
69386,holy shit the comment section here,7,
69387,wooooooooo south dakota made the front page  fuck  for awful reasons again,3,
69388,if the victim was 14  the jury would be hung  as the victim is actually way below the age of puberty  she ll be fried,5,
69389,holy crap  they actually called it rape,6,
69390,i do nt understand  i thought women could nt do this  maybe those college classes on how not to rape should include women,6,
69391,not one comment about how she should be killed or have a train run on her in prison double standards so glaring it s like staring at the su,5,
69392,women dont go to jail as much as men for the same crime it s disgustin,6,

69405,why is this front pag,,
69408,i grew up in a very small rural town  the high school i attended is part of a huge high school rivalry  one of the biggest in the nation hell its not uncommon for 20000 plus fans to attend the rivalry game  its so big it s held in a college stadium and has more people attend it then the college division 1 team any way i have friends and family members who are convinced the only way to go to college and make something out of yourself is to get there on a football scholarship one of my cousins young kid 16ish has already had a few concussions  his dad just chalks it up to part of the game and thinks parents need to stop being such  pussies  football is for men and if a boy ca nt take it he will never be a man sadly i think a lot of parents feel this way,9,
69409,smart move by him  if anything athletes should be focusing back on baseball guaranteed money and long contract,9,
69410,and it begins  the exodus away from our national infatuation with football,8,
69411,tbi survivor here and former football fanatic even had a denver broncos tat which has since been covered with some other nonsense anyway  brain injuries are obviously bad news as is the nfl s handling of them  i hope this becomes a trend,7,
69412,good for him  football does nt have to be a concussion prone sport it started as the american version of rugby  and evolved into the form we see today  and can just as properly evolve into something that is nt effectively a form of human sacrifice  part of how it evolved is the career of pop warner  the coach of the carlisle indian school he kept  how to put it  coaching like a lawyer  and coming up with clever ways to get an edge  that would then eb slapped down with rule changes  surely concussions justify rule changes too,7,
69413,i played football for 4 years in highschool started all 4 years i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fu,3,
69414,this is really just a click bait story no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers  i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is,5,
69415,who would let their son play american football,1,
69416, he s made a terrible mistake    https  wwwredditcomrnewscomments462zg514yearold_wisconsin_basketball_player_impaled_by,1,
69417,suffered some pretty brutal concussions playing hoops in high school and college if he is looking to mitigate his risk  he might want to rethink athletics all together,1,
69418,the student   i did nt want my life to end up as part of a shitty movie like concussion ,1,
69419,plot twist  he ca nt shoot,1,
69420,there are so many cool sports out there that have gone down in popularity that are cool out therewrestling for example,1,
69421,i hope he wears a big ass helmet all the time in order to avoid irony them baseballs travel fast,,
69423,fucking sad how this was nt described as an act of terrorism i guess that title is reserved for nonchristians,9,
69424,it is sad that it closed even for a short time people like fiorina do nt give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time,8,
69425,definitely not terrorism though  just a little rampage  you know he was probably having a bad day or something,8,
69426,good for them  dont let those freedom hating assholes scare you away from your job,8,
69427,how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him,4,
69428,is carly out of the race yet  i do nt think that rightwing  fringe conartist is done riling up her terrorist sect,7,
69429,deadly rampage  was  terrorist attack  a little too onthenose,7,
69430,why does this headline say  deadly rampage  and not  christian terrorism ,5,
69431,now i m not a fan of abortions but who the hell can think to themselves i know how to stop babies from being aborted  i ll just shoot all the moms and their doctors  absolute lunatic,1,
69432,thank god its back open now we can get back to crushing fetus  heads and sucking their brains out like normal people,,
69433,on president s day   the gaul,,
69434,so  someone went on a shooting rampage and killed people in order to stop planned parenthood from killing people  but now planned parenthood is open again  and proudly killing people  well  i am glad that worked out the entire thing makes tons of sense,,
69435,pp is where there is regular deadly rampages against unborn babies,,
69436,planned parenthood is basically condoms and the oklahoma city bombing,,
69438,its really a shame that this is even nessesar,9,
69439,coulda gave that money to kany,9,
69440,these responses wow,9,
69441,good god rnews commentary is really descending to the level of youtube comments  get a grip you sad sods,8,
69442,may god bless him he is a true patriot spend the money for the future generation through the preservation of our national treasures,9,
69443,how many hellfire missiles would that buy,8,
69444,this is a great thing people who are bashing him do not make much sense the monuments in dc are one of the united states  greatest treasures  and likewise they cost a lot to maintain let alone refurbish they are a public venue that is traversed by millions and are awesome to each person that visits  this guy decided to use some of his money to give back and better public places that reside in our nation capital and some see him as an asshole  it is one thing to be bitter about not having that kind of money  it is another thing to get pissed when someone with money gives back,7,
69445,its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring,3,
69446,good for him i remember the lincoln memorial being one of my more favorite monuments i d like to take my son there some day  so it s nice to see it will be upgraded and fixed up  to all the naysayers and negative commenters  fuck you,6,
69447,in this thread hooray  what an awesome guy and  also fuck him  he should have used pennie,6,
69448,how is he a philanthropist  he s giving money to statues  not to people maybe he s a philstatuist,5,
69449,congratulations  you just bought  18 million worth of  charity shaming   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  aksowj8agwo ,5,
69450,how dare that onepercenter not keep that money to themselves it s as if they are nt evil like sanders wants you to believ,,
69451,i think it s great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about what i do nt like is that there should nt even be an issue with funding for our monuments,3,
69452,if we re committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i m all for it,1,
69453,i wonder how many huge donations like this  maybe smaller  in the hundreds of thousands  have been made for national monuments pretty awesome someone did this wo reading the article  i have to imagine there s a good amount of rigmarole on the donor s end to ensure the donation goes to where the donor actually wanted govt accountability on any level in the us seems kind of weak lately,1,
69454,all right  a 15000sqft exhibit room underneathkind of like the one in fallout ,1,
69455,can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too,1,
69456,oh cool thanks  philanthropist guy,1,
69457,wow  what an honorable thing to do  while 99  of people in his position would spend the money on useless crap  this guy chooses to spend his money on something so selfless and so much bigger than himself  this guy is a good 1  e,,
69458,it d be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro,1,
69459,that s nice for a full on rapist to do,,
69460,let s laugh at people in need by blowing tens of millions on nonessential shit that basically benefits nobody in any significant way  edit  and get tax breaks from it too,,
69461,no matter what some peasant is going to whine rich guy should ve just kept his money to himself and these poors would nt even know  i thank him  i ll go to dc eventually the whiners here probably could nt afford any type of vacation  or if they could  only by living paycheck to paycheck,,
69462,we are living in a new gilded age,,
69463,i certainly appreciate what david has done here but  with all due respect to david  most americans would rather not see financial industry groups  like the carlyle group  suck economic resources out ofaway from most americans instead  we d prefer to pay for these efforts through widespread  robust economic opportunities and the tax contributions they make possible millions of americans and this nation have been greatly diminished as a result of the business activities of groups  like the carlyle group  over several decades  because of grotesque incomewealth inequality  the odds of seeing successful businesspeople like david rubinstein are greatly diminished he only got where he was because of the social ladder that used to exist in this nation,,
69464,how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions,,
69465,it s gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface themfight to take them down,,
69466,those goddamn rich people are at it again  dammit if we could only find a way to tax away their wealth so we could spend it on poorly negotiated deals for mediocre roads and bridges,,
69467,wow  what a waste of money,,
69468,fixing stupid shit is hardly philanthropy,,
69469,i m pretty sure there are roads around there that could have used that money  priorities  people,,
69470,because republicans refuse to pay for it from fed budget ,,
69471,congratulations  you just bought  18 million worth of  charity shaming   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  aksowj8agwo ,,
69472, 18 million  that could have stopped about 6000 kids from dying of malaria   http  wwwgivewellorginternationaltopcharitiesamf  costperlifesaved   one man s philanthropist is another man s guy who does nt see the big picture,,
69476,this is why a lot of former cops are setting up companies where they transport the cash for it it s also a huge motivation for the stores to keep 2 separate sets of books  a real one and one the irs gets to see,9,
69477,this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day,9,
69478,gt  one of the three men who escaped from a california jail last month had been charged with kidnapping a marijuana dispensary owner that they suspected had hidden large amounts of cash in the desert the man and his accomplices are accused of driving the dispensary owner out to the desert  torturing him and cutting off his penis  sheesh i m not carrying more than  10 in my wallet from now on  and that has nothing to do with the fact that i m broke,9,
69479,this is why they get robbed all the time out here no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys,7,
69480,ca nt these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us,8,
69481,there s a great documentary on netflix called  high profits  about a business in breckenridge  co right before full legalization took effect  one of the big issues was exactly this only being able to do business in cash from payroll to paying city taxes they had  120k in cash they had to just walk into the front of the city building with and that was just the first month alone  some of the people that make the drops to the shops are walking out with  10k in their pockets and no security at all it s terrifying,8,
69482,civil forfeiture time,6,
69483,ironically  it s also just flat out illegal to own large sums of money anything over a few hundred bucks  and the government can sieze that money  because the money committed the crime of intent to purchase narcotics,9,
69484,time to start using gold,5,
69485,so the tax man will gladly take cannadollars  but the banks will not this is ridiculously stupid,5,
69486,same deal in washington still have to buy my shit with cash oh but i can buy cigs and alcohol with a card no problem  if you want to pick up a gram here or there it s no problem  but i buy in bulk  since it s cheaper that means i need to stop by the bank to get  140 that s the only time i carry that much money on me  it s like requiring a personal check to get a passport no cashier s check  no card wtf it s 2016,7,
69487,are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money,5,
69488,this war on cash is such bullshit  people carried cash until 12 years ago and it was perfectly fine  now they are trying to restrict flying with cash  purchasing with cash  seizing cash   the only problem is that the money is due on one day  they need to have the tax office take payment on any day of the week  so it s stacked,6,
69489,i wonder how negative interest rates  if implemented  would effect the marijuana business these value of the business would probably increase as they had large sums of cash on hand their credit worthiness would increase because they had something of value  cash  but they would be penalized for depositing that cash according to the recent imf working paper i wonder if they would become attractive targets for some banks to help capitalize their weak balance sheets,3,
69490,oh well let you do business  but you just wo nt be able to use any banks what a backwards ass countr,3,
69491,this is a perfect storm for evil doers who seize this unfortunate opportunity all they would have to to do is steak out a caregiver facility i would hope something changes soon this is absurd and the last word of that article  like my post  is penis,3,
69492,they should accept bitcoin problem solved,3,
69493,and you just made it worse by telling people thi,6,
69494,meanwhile   larry summers  it s time to kill the  100 bill   http  wwwbusinessinsidercomsummerstimetokillthe100bill20162  the banking system is corrupt anyhow its time to flush this turd system for something better,5,
69495,sell gift cards  buy them with debitcredit then use the gift card,5,
69496,so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash,4,
69497,bitcoin is the answe,4,
69498,time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins,3,
69499,that  s because it  s cash day at the collection center  when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill  and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot,1,
69500,pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california,1,
69501,its a shame they cant count on the highwayrobber police to guard the money,1,
69502,it looks like they re tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books,1,
69503,this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is,1,
69504,someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy,1,
69505,what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit  checks for those transactions  then just but the trees with the gift certificate,1,
69506,as if the banks do nt take drug money as we speak it is also not like the fbi do nt have cases on going against those banks i really do nt see why there is a problem,1,
69507,can they not employ armored trucks,1,
69508,it s the same way in washington and colorado it s still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed,1,
69509,since the money cant be deposited into a bank would a good option to take be converting it into precious metals such as gold  you would still need to store the gold but that could be easily done in a safety deposit however unless you know where to go  getting that much gold could raise the attention of people you dont want raised to begin with it s not like in china or india  if you show up with a briefcase of cash and walk out with a smaller case of gold  no one really cares,1,
69510,can they print their tax forms using hemp paper  and then turn them into the irs,1,
69511,watch out for that   cop robbery   civil asset forfeiture,1,
69512,so  did anyone else read that article right to the end  the last sentence oof,1,
69513,it would be interesting for all of the companies to announce they were bringing their taxes to the tax office on a particular day let it be known to all criminals in the state i wonder if the state might decide to put some security on the place  then,1,
69514,build your own secure fort no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building,1,
69517,gt   the order is vague and because it imposes disproportionate  intrusive  and punitive measures against households and businesses with   no due process     did nt see that one coming,9,
69518,isps do nt actually want to spy on their customers like that it costs more money to put systems in place to do so and to maintain and operate those systems on top of that  it will only bring them bad press that could piss off customers  cox is basically saying  fuck you i m not taking a significant financial hit to spy on our customers so you can sue them and make money for yourself  they are doing the right thing  and the right thing also happens to be in their best business interest,9,
69519,good guy cox  not selling out their customers  they actually have super reliable internet no outages in any of my apartments so far,9,
69520,so to sum that up we do nt have to worry about any cox blocking,9,
69521,that s nice  but i m still going to run a vpn,8,
69522,all in all i ve been pretty happy with cox as an isp i ve used them in two different cities and it s always been reliable and fast i pay for 300mbps service and always get those speeds  usually higher almost no outages they re putting in 1gbs service in many of their cities right now  including mine  my biggest gripe with them is they have a soft data cap of 2 tb for my tier they do not enforce the caps at all but the fact that they exist means they are probably toying with the idea and there would be nothing to stop them from going evil since they are a monopoly like every other major isp it s like a benevolent dictatorship  http  wwwspeedtestnetmyresult5089441276 that s with a netflix stream going on in another room right now,9,
69523,this must be a new thing many a year s ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did nt even know what that was  none of us knew what that even was and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi,7,
69524,i ve been really happy with cox for an isp both personally and professionally here in okc personally  out of nowhere they bumped my at home connection from 15mbit to 100mbit and my bill  went down  30  all out of nowhere  without me saying a word internet is always up  not throttled  and they have decent support if it s needed  professionally at my job i ran in ip phone deployment with them for our main office  3 satellite offices they were there 100  of the way i have personal names and numbers to call in the event of issues outside of the scope of my support as the companies it admin  and when we ve needed someone on site to climb a pole for instance their longest response time was 45 minutes  i know this sounds like rhailcorporate but the fact is out of all the isps i ve had  comcast  qwest  charter  etc  they ve been the best that s not saying they should nt and could nt be better  but they re angels next to the others  in fact they proactively contact me at work every once and awhile to check on things which i greatly appreciate and they bring us cookies every month yes  our isp brings yes cookies no  we re not a big company 9 employees they re just nice,7,
69525,basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum,8,
69526,i used to work for cox in the field and inside cox did have a department that would monitor massive down loading and uploading but they did away with it shortly after i got there  within a year cox ca nt afford to lose customers right now so it s no surprise they are nt allowing this if they did then they would go out of business from customer loss i survived their huge layoff and realignment,5,
69527,this is nothing new from cox i have had cox internet for over 10 years and worked for them a few years ago they have always had this attitude toward it s customers the customer pays for internet access  cox provides internet access they do nt even enforce data caps  at least in oklahoma   i have received a few emails due to using so much data suggesting that i switch to a business plan to maximize my speed  but have never been charged extra or cut off due to exceeding a data cap,6,
69528,gt  last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers  what the actual fucking fuck,6,
69529,as a customer this is the first good thing i ve ever heard from cox,4,
69530,not true from my experience,3,
69531,i ve had them as an isp for several years and they re excellent i did have one month where i went over my allowed bandwidth limit  300 gb on a 50 mbps down plan   and all i got was an email saying  do nt do that again   no throttling or charges or anything on 100 mbps down plan right now and i usually get 110 at least they re great  come out to me if i m having internet trouble that s not solved by online support  etc pretty good basically  i love cox and i m very satisfied with how much i get,3,
69532,unrelated but i could nt stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox,3,
69533,i am a proud supporter of cox,3,
69534,where are all the penis jokes,3,
69535,not as nice as it sounds if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do nt catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status  eg that they do nt have any liabilityresponsibility for what people use their pipe for   most carriers are  very  vested in not being the internet police,3,
69536,i m guessing that if they had a way to monetize it and add to the bottom line  they d be very supportive,3,
69537,when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battl,5,
69538,cox is actually a familyowned business one of the major interest holders is a 96 year old woman who inherited from her father  she had been running it with her sister until her death in 2007   i happen to think they re one of the leastshady isp and cable providers out there  they also own the travel channel  which is a pretty great channel,4,
69539,i thought this was talking about jesse cox,5,
69540,i work for cox corporate in a startup tech company  and this makes me so happy  btw  they re just as decent an employer as they are an isp compan,3,
69541,cox is spying like a champ  rest assured you have to be quite innocent or high on meth to think they have nt supplied info to big brother and his little brothers  and will not in the future,3,
69542,yells loudly  i will not    whispers  if you need me too,1,
69543,on that headline alone  i thought jessie cox was asked to spy on his youtube subs  was very confused for a little bit,1,
69544,i knew he was my favorite eagl,1,
69545,well that s one bit of good news from cox now if they d stop raising my rates every few months,1,
69546,damn  i wish i had cox i have time warner and i m on my 3rd notice to stop torrenting i do nt know if they ll actually pull the plug  they re charging me out the ass already since they re the only provider in my area,1,
69547,fuck yea cox   comcast   1  co,1,
69548,cox  and to some extent time warner  are cable companies all cable companies fuck you in the ass  these two have the decency to spit on it first i at the very least get what i pay for with both of them,1,
69549,they sent me a few emails in the past  so i got a vpn i will still use it  but good on cox for not being dickbags,1,

69551,i had cox for 3 years service was good  and over that 3 years  doubled my download speeds twice no extra cost upload was still garbage  but hey 10015 internet for  65 a month was still pretty killer i have 7575 fios now,1,
69552,almost every single person in my area that has gone to atamp  t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable  they have some shit with them but it s far less shit than others,1,
69553,they re my isp and even though they re the only isp in my city besides att and verizon  they ve been awesome,1,
69554,the shifting of blame to continue  going after johns and endusers has never worked,1,
69555,ho yeah  today is a good day to have cox  teehee,1,
69556,horseshit they cut off our internet because someone was downloading something like a year ago they re the best isp i ve ever used  but they absolutely do exactly what the mpaa et al want,1,
69557,between cox and cable one in both places i live  i actually like our midwest internet providers i feel bad for people getting rammed by twc and comcast we ve paid  45 for 100mbps for several years  which sounds way better than the horror stories i hear from you guys,1,
69558,cause they love internet freedom  or because it costs an extra 30 cents to have an extra indian screen data at the call center for 70 an hour,1,
69559,protected pirate plan from cox   7500month,1,
69562,living in germany and studying  i m gon na pay 300   335   for the upcoming semester  these 335  also includes a public transportation ticket  which is in your student id  that allows me to take the train  bus  tram etc at any time as much as i like in my entire state  books are nt nearly as expensive as in the us  the most expensive book i bought last semester was 80   89    but  seriously  95  of the content for the majority of the courses are uploaded on the university s website  files and documents which you can download for free  also  the university canteen offers you decent food for a fair price  normally around 35   in the end my biggest expenses during my semester are the coffees i buy on campu,9,
69563,i m from the uk and have lived in germany for 6 years now i came here with a 20000 gbp student loan for a 4 year degree in computer science  now i m about to start a masters in web science that will cost me about 1000 eur for the 2 year course  parttime and remote  i m also just about to get german citizenship  most germans are happy to speak english  i have a job here and although most of the company speak english they make i point of speaking german with me  and i with them  i m not very good at german but am slowly learning now after 5 years of being very lazy about learning the language it s a very hard language to learn  screw those articles   but in time you ll get used to it  i absolutely love speaking to locals in german and being understood by them  to me it s like being on another planet and finally being accepted by the local populus  good luck to anyone who wants to come over  it is a wise move  come and see me near koblenz,9,
69564,a friends son went to college in switzerland  we are american  even though he paid additional fees as a non native  and had to travel back and forth to europe  he still paid less than kids who went to local colleges,9,
69565,come gather around the fire and listen to a tale of a spooky and simple explanation of our increasing tuition rates in the us  the government started giving student loans kids take the debt  the schools get the money tuition prices increase because they can rely on the kids to get a gov loan take away student loans  then schools ca nt rely on this money  kids ca nt afford the jacked up tuitions  enrollments drop  schools are forced to cut tuition  now more affordable again it s the same problem with mortgage crisis  just a different industry,9,
69566,it s almost as if germany sees the benefit of having a well educated work force that is not bogged down by insurmountable debt,9,
69567,my college actually sodomizes me,9,
69568,whereas here in the states  they will gladly charge you a  250semester parking fee and you will still not actually be guaranteed a space,8,
69569,maybe i should go to germany,9,
69570,currently living in germany  as an american student on an international internship  what this is nt telling you is that the uni system is significantly different my roommates  all in engineering or other sciences  study all day every day they have a month of exams coming up  and they usually have only one exam per year you fail that  you fail no assignments  projects  etc  just that exam  did i mention this was a fraternity  yeah  they do nt go to uni because everyone does it  like america they work  they get accepted  and they work even more it is nt for partying  it is nt for meeting your spouse or friends  it s for becoming the best you can be  which is how a university should be  good luck to the americans coming here thinking it s anything like the states enjoy the d  ner,9,
69571,something like this gets posted everysingleweek without fail and then a bunch of americans start making hasty decisions to just go study in germany because it s  free   oh and it has been this way for years so it is nt a new thing  the german courses that you will have to take for at least a year to reach fluency are around  300 a month and noduolingo is absolutely not enough to get you to the level you need to study at university  the fees for applications are at  75 then an additional 15  for each university you apply to after the first it can go well into the hundreds  the bank account you have to open for your student visa has to have a frozen amount of at least approx   8500 this is nt to say it is impossible but do nt expect roses and rainbows and raining beer amp  wurst to await your easy university life in germany  also american universities except the few ivy leagues or outstanding schools  baby the absolute shit outta you you can pretty much sail smoothly your first two years while you get your core courses out of the way in germany  you jump right into it in german remember  a different language a crazy  difficult language at that the high school diploma is also not equivalent to the german one that allows you to study at a university the equivalent would be a plethora of ap courses with really good grades or a high school diploma plus two years of college with really good grades and then you re equivalent to a german high school graduate  you will also most likely not be able to transfer credits  german bureaucracy  a bitch you will have to have german knowledge when applying for your visas or someone to be a translator there with you  you may have to do a prep year for certain programs as well it is also very competitive to get into even these programs  i sound like fucking scrooge but i ve been through all of it as so have many people i met along the way  it is possible but it will take a lot of hard work and dedication and time that you wo nt regret  losing  because it may not work out perfectly you may get rejected you may not be accepted for that semester a lot of the popular programs have a cap so it s very restricted in terms of amount of students accepted  do nt expect germany to be a country that is just waiting and fiddling its thumbs for the americans to come and study in their unis for  free  and think that they re gon na make it easy for you it is anything but,9,
69572,my american husband started learning german at the age of 26 a year later he was admitted to vet school here he s almost finished now we ve been paying 120 euros a semester i think he s the only foreign student to not drop out in his class though the drop out rate is high even for germans while he s happy he is debt free  the immense stress of having to learn a very hard subject in a foreign language and a foreign system  bureaucracy is insane here   have caused many panic attacks and one major case of depression and he has nt even started the huge final exam yet but at least we wo nt be  200k in debt when this is over,8,
69573,the fee is actually 150500  per semester books inclusive because of librarys and because we live in 2016 and share digitaly public transport also free  you get 600  per month plus health care  if your parents arent rich  this will be checked by government  as student  and will have to pay back   half of that   in worst conditions after you finished  also  after 3 semesters you must have passed 23 of your finals at any time to get your  baf  g  money  but this will only be checked once no money for extra semesters of course,9,
69574,in my opinion let them come here  let them study here and let them stay here if they want besides the fact that the ones who stay make up for the cost of education it is a great way of cultural exchange  it s always nice to have friends from different countries  so if you are coming to the area of n  rnberg just text me ,8,
69575,currently living in duisburg  germany and studying at the university of duisburgessen   my choice   i grew up in the us  but my parents are from germany after graduating high school it became apparent that studying in germany was an opportunity that i could not pass up i chose my current uni because it has an international studies in engineering program which allows me to pursue a bachelors degree in computer engineering with the first year taught entirely in english   costs   the costs are definitively low the semester fee  including public transport  is below 300   my total living expenses are below 700  a month and that includes health insurance   my experience so far   keep in my mind i m still in my first semester  as others have mentioned before  the majority of students quit after the first year last year  the failure rate of an exam taken by 200 students was over 95   attending lectures is completely voluntary and there is one exam at the end of each course that makes up 100  of your final course grade no homework is given and you are very much on your own forcing yourself to focus and learn everyday can be a serious challenge  feel free to comment or pm with any questions,7,
69576,many american students also come with very false expectations about what german university is like you have to be way more self organised and please do nt expect multiple choice tests,9,
69577,we need to stop this immigration because when america sends its people  it sends unskilled people and we have to spend our money on them we are going to build a wall  get america to pay for it and make germany great again,9,
69578,you can only offer something for free if you limit supply fewer germans go to college than us students   only 30  of germans ages 2534 have completed a tertiary education  which includes academic degrees and some but not all vocational programs that  s below the oecd average  and below the us 45  attainment rate for the same age group  http  wwwlatimescomlocaleducationcommunitylameedufreecollegeeducationingermanybutnotincalifornia20151029htmlstoryhtml edit  so now i am amused that many people are suggesting that fewer people should go to college in the us  presumably other people  not so much themselves they are smart   it seems like this would be a less popular proposal than promising free tuition,9,
69581,well shit i just read a til like last week about him still being alive,1,
69582,his fatal mistake was using that old refrigerator to play hide and seek,1,
69584,interesting though   since 2005  texas has prosecuted 38 juveniles for intoxication manslaughter or intoxication assault only three were sent to the adult system  and half of all cases resulted in probation of some kind  i think this is more telling of the justice system  and accessibility to competent  quality counsel it s clear money buys better legal counsel  but if the government subsidized public defense more heavily  the outcomes would clearly be different,9,
69585,cash is king in the world of corruption,9,
69586,i said this somwhere else  but it s also pertinent here  everyone is equal under the law and money is how we measure that equality,9,
69587,the difference  money,9,
69588,it s almost like the rich live under different rules,8,
69589,this is standard practice in the us judicial system outcomes will vary from case to case depending on financial status there s actually a legal term for it  it s called   cream ,9,
69590,my mom has always said guilty until proven rich,8,
69591,i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law this is the american dream,7,
69592,and liberty and justice for all  who can afford it ,5,
69593,i love how this article just glosses over the fact that arellano had previous dui convictions which is why he did nt receive the same sentence  this was couch s first dui case which is why he got probation  as texas takes the rehab route  but whatever lets rage and ignore the fact,8,
69594,is everyone here honestly  seriously shocked that money gets you out of trouble  am i taking crazy pills,5,
69595,going beyond the dae legal system is corrupt  circlejerk in this thread  there are certainly some differences in these cases firstly  the arellano case  the other one in the article  happened in 2007  six years before couch s trial likewise  the article says that arellano had driven while intoxicated and drank underage before  which means that he would ve had a greater chance of being moved to an adult trial meanwhile  couch had no prior violations of the law  meaning that he could nt be moved to an adult court,7,
69596,i understand what you are trying to do with your anecdotal case comparisons however  they are nt comparable cases when you consider all the factors  including criminal history  but  even if you ignore all the other factors  i know of a white 20 yo male from a fairly wealthy family in my area who was sent to prison for a year based on a drunk driving accident so my anecdotal evidence shows similar punishment to your anecdotal case thereby anecdotally refuting your point,8,
69597,the real crime here those eyebrow,6,
69598,gee  it s almost like different judges and prosecutors in different areas with separate cases can lead to different verdicts or something,7,
69599,that s why the case became famous because he got away while guilty that was autocorrect capitalization,4,
69600,affluenza is just a fake term that means the following  if you are rich  you do nt go to jail if you are not  you will spend 10 years like 95  of americans,4,
69601,let s be clear what happened to the poor kid was what s supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone you fucking go to prison couch was the exception,7,
69602,he did nt go free he was on probation and then he violated that  so he s going to jail,8,
69603,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,3,
69604,if someone is brought up too rich to not know the difference between right and wrong  why can the same argument not be used for poor people who commit crimes  people who are brought up in poverty do nt really know right from wrong just as much as a kid who has rich parents,3,
69605,that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time,3,
69606,  sees title   probably not a rich white kid   clicks article   and yuuuuuuuuuup sm,3,
69607,prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win,3,
69608,obviously as white god intended,3,
69609,i fucking hate ethan couch  i mean look at that look on his face disgusting i mean even his name is stupid,6,
69610,horrible headline  38 cases of dui manslaughter in texas since 2005 and only 3 of them went to adult court  that tells you the vast majority of these cases are handled with kid glovesso picking out one of 3 that went the other route and comparing it to the affluenza case is disingenuous  but fuck it  that is what the media does today god forbid they instead do an article focusing on how in texas if you are a drunk driving kid that kills people you will get away with it 35 out of 38 time,4,
69611,it did nt seem to mention how they had the same judge  we ve already established this same judge would have been open to giving a similar sentence to a poor minority because she tried to do just that keep making this a race issue  though lord knows the media loves to stir up ignorant poor folks  also  anyone who comes to the us illegally and kills is citizens deserves little sympathy he was a juvenile  so it would be appropriate to release him and deport him  i do nt understand the need to distort issues to make tbem about race we already have enough problems it s already an established fact that those with the means to afford a lawyer fair better than those who do nt,3,
69612,the difference  money,1,
69613,did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window,1,
69614,by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time,1,
69615,excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did,1,
69616,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,1,
69617,lemmeguess ethnic  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they re ethnic,1,
69618,cash rules everything around me they have  and very good lawyers,1,
69619,well  on one hand you have a kid that killed 3 adults and a child in a crash  and on the other a kid who killed a mother and her  unborn child  in a crash in a conservative state so he could have mowed down 10 born people and probably got less than what he gets for  accidentally  killing 1 unborn baby,1,
69620,free public defender vs 2000  an hour lawyer,1,
69621,this affluenza thing still baffles me  doing bad things because money  with that sort of logic hobos must be saints and not the crack heads living under bridges,1,
69622,no shit  i mean was nt the entire outrage that similar cases normally lead to prison in the first place,1,
69623,seriously  the rich kid,1,
69624,that s what  affluenza  means literally the entire point of this case and why it s been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich,1,
69625,i say it like my grandma used to  money talks  bullshit walks,1,
69626,he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows wtf,1,
69627,there s actually a legal question that you asked,1,
69628,you do nt automatically get a dui in fact,1,

69642,i believe we have gangs that are setting these kids up with a hair trigger  and along comes a cop that sets them off  we need to get to the root problem as well as locking up the kids,7,

69654,hope he gets a fair trial y,,
69655,so this guy is innocent until proven guilty right  why is this investigation so short  we do nt know the details  why does it take a year to investigate an officer for shooting someone  and this takes a couple of days to charge this guy  is that disconnect enough to make anyone here question things enough to accept that there is a massive encompassing problem with our legal system  i always have to wonder because we see many of the same people calling for people to wait for details after an officer shoots someone  telling us not to be monday morning quarterbacks then stories like this pop up and we have those same people frothing at the mouth in this situation where it has nt been given the year plus of investigation that an officer who shoots someone would be given the guy is already guilty despite the cries to give officers the benefit of the doubt because of the innocent until proven principle,,
69656,how the hell do you survive a gunshot to the face  that s some 50 cent shit,,

69668,i know it is a reach but why do these people need to make high salaries it is a charity you are supposed to be doing something good for other people if pay is needed then just like congress no more than 80k you are performing a service for people  10 of those charities involve the police the nickel tin mafia have their hands in all kinds of money making rackets,1,
69670,i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic,9,
69671,for those unaware  he is one of the marines who carried sgt major kasal out of the fallujah  hellhouse  it is  in my opinion  one of the most iconic photos of the iraq war this photo  https  iimgurcomtezsn9zjp,9,
69672,i live in dc groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day never makes the news public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do nt know what they are doing worst part it s never anyone who will fight back not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 1315 but they have seriously injured folks in the past brain damage and internal bleeding i typically avoid groups of young black men now i feel a little bad about it like i m being racist but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted,9,

69676,not only did they assault a veteran with a deadly weapon  they used his credit cards at locations should nt be too tough to find them fuck these kids,8,
69677,this is a pretty typical mugging the mugger aggressively asks you a question  and regardless of your answer they either beat you or ask for money sometimes it s shit like  do you care about the homeless   and if you say  yes  then they aggressively ask for money and if you say no they get upset and threaten you and say you are a liar if you say no  they threaten to beat you or they just get violent either way  you are going to end up giving them your walletmoney another common one is asking you for a cigarette if you do nt have any  they will accuse you of having one and not giving it to them because of some stupid reason  racism  greed  etc  and then get aggressive and demand money for a pack of cigarettes whenif you pull out your wallet they will just grab it and walk away or beat you and run  i was on a bus and had a guy ask for my cell phone to make a call  when i said no  he said i was a racist because i assumed he was going to steal it made a big scene and stood up and got in my face and started slapping my head until i gave him the phone then he got off the bus  same principle with this happens all the fucking time if they get caught they usually say shit like  oh he gave it to me  i did nt steal it  scumbags only reason this one made the news is because it was a war vet,9,

69680,from the daily caller article  gt   i believe this was a hate crime and i was targeted because of my skin color   marquez told the dcnf  too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the main stream media refuses to report on it  woah there racist  only black people can be the victim of a hate crime  now take your beating and shut the hell up about these underprivileged disadvantaged teen youths,8,
69681,i m sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case,8,

69683,black lives do matter these teens  lives  however do not,9,
69684,every fucking time a cop shoots a black guy  justified or not  we have people like obama telling us we have to do some  soul searching  and when cities like dc and baltimore  i live around both and can personally attest that shit like this happens all the time and is usually never reported  and detroit and new york and such have this shit happen  it s a non issue  fuck all of it  trump 201,8,

69690, do black lives matter if you do nt agree we ll beat and rob you   and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement,8,
69691,i would like to remind everyone that bernie sanders has aligned himself with and defended the black lives matter movement in many of his speeches he talks about sandra bland  michael brown  eric garner and in typical fashion blames racism and the white establishment sanders never once mentions the blacks that are home invading in indianapolis  kansas city  atlanta  etc he never once talks about the blacks that have shot at and killed police  most recently a 19 year old black man shoots an officer in mississippi black lives matter and politicians like sanders are waging that the future will be less white and in that future you folks can imagine who will be the most vile and racist  edit  from today  white house tweets shoutout to grammy winner of best rap album  still no word on recent spate of cop killing,9,
69692,let s see if this gets labeled as the hate crime it very clearly is  who am i kidding  that wo nt happen,8,

69714,i certainly do nt necessarily agree with public funds being used for a sports stadium  and i definitely do nt agree with nepotism  but i think criticizing mike illitch somehow taking advantage of detroit is a shortsighted mistake had it not been for mr illitch pretty much singlehandily reinvesting in a city everyone wanted to leave behind over the last 20 years  the city would nt even be close to back on a path to relevancy  whether you want to believe it is or not   the other thing to consider is that this new complex not only brings commerce to an area that was a combination of blight and open fields  it also brings quite a few jobs to the city  as well as some stateoftheart buildings that will bring commerce and international travelers to the area for a variety of reasons  conferences  concerts  etc   this all equals more money for the city of detroit  which is why they re willing to make the investment in the first place   and another part of a blightfilled neighborhood updated and usable for the future  this is a sticky situation that reeks of an unfortunate quidproquo  but when it comes to what is good for the city of detroit  it s hard to argue that anyone has anything on the passion and dedication of mike illitch,9,
69715,how in the fuck are there no comments about the red wings owner s hair  ,9,
69716,everyone talks about the insanity in pro sports these days  yet no one mentions  public or private  universities  which are all nonprofit  spending massive amounts of their cash on stadiums  athletic facilities  etc it s the same thing if the universities are public  and its only marginally different if they re private the reason they have that money in the first place is federallysubsidized student loans,8,
69717,lol illitch has done more for the city of detroit than any other person in the last 50 years fuck off,9,
69718,so he did a good job for the team and the owner offered him more money for a better job  happens all the time  kids,6,
69719,is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit  or ford field  most people would not step foot downtown if it was nt for those two places i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do nt bring forth revitalization like intendedbut the only article i ve read was about stadiums in la and sf,6,
69720,before you jump on the  why ca nt detroit use the money for things that actually matter  train   here s   http  wwwcrainsdetroitcomarticle20140921news309219990oncostfinancingofwingsarenahereareanswers  an article outlining the finances of this massive project  edit  s  for those not wanting to click  gt  the initial base price is  450 million problems  changes and added amenities could increase that final cost anything beyond  450 million must be paid by the ilitches  gt  the michigan strategic fund will sell  450 million in two series of bonds they will be divided into  250 million in series a bonds that will be backed by property taxes already captured by the downtown development authority the  200 million in series b bonds will be backed by the  115 million olympia development has agreed to pay the dda for bond retirement  gt  the ilitches  through olympia  will pay  200 million of the bond debt detroit s dda  via its property tax capture ability  will pay back  250 million of the bonds new yorkbased merrill lynch  a division of bank of america  which has pledged to buy all the publicly backed series a bonds in the deal it will then sell the bonds to the public dallasbased comerica bank inc will buy the series b bonds backed by olympia s money the bank  formerly based in detroit  has the naming rights to comerica park  where the ilitchowned detroit tigers play comerica intends to keep the bonds on its books rather then sell them,8,
69721, misleading title   https  wwwredditcomrhockeycomments45xs0mdetroit_contractor_who_negotiated_285_million_ind00vnke   it was state money  not detroit s also  ilitch footed most of the bill himself  or through his company   please research  the district  and see their plans for it before passing judgement,9,
69722,clickbait no one around here is remotely upset about taxpayer funds going to a new stadium for the most popular team in town we re not really unhappy about the new development for business and residences that is happening and we re not raising any concerns about the effort to revitalize the city  detroit is climbing out of a hole created by the corruption of influential individuals local business and leaders have been more beneficial in this process than any other group and this stadium  and the district surrounding it are seen as victories in this effort,8,
69723,ah  a local spin on the old  congressperson becomes lobbyist  setup,3,
69724,they are literally building new district for the city not just an arena  a whole new district development is what the city needs and frankly  detroit politics have always been just a  wee  bit corrup,4,
69725,but  guys  come on we need our circuses  what would we do with out national sports  concentrate on real issues  lol  that s no fun ,4,
69726,at ohio state  the man whole negotiated the deal to sell its parking rights to a private company  campusparc  left to work for them after it was signed,4,
69727,you think that s a wig,4,
69728,public money should never be allowed to pay for sports teams unless the team has to pay back the city directly  with interest none of this but businesses will benefit  bullsht it s my fucking money you re stealing  i do nt want to  potentially  subsidize businesses downtown,8,
69729,if you re a bernie supporter  who thinks a public funded  1 trillion dollar infrastructure package is a good deal because jobs  but is outraged by the state of michigan investing  285 million in the renovationrevitalization of its  largest city  then you might want to reexamine one of those positions,6,
69730,for all the people complaining about spending the money on the new stadium and  less mentioned  surrounding developments  all i can say is it will be more than worth it if it fixes up that area governments of all levels have been dumping money into the cass corridor since the early days of johnson s great society programs with any luck this will finally be a solution that stick,7,
69731,itt  out of staters have no fucking idea about the current state of economics in detroit and how great this project is going to be for the city  i do nt even know where to begin with this article it s clear the author did nt talk to a single person in the city or state or even try to get a feel for the public opinion on the topic including garbage clickbait phrases like the previous article titled  detroit scam city  how the red wings took hockeytown for all it had  has to be one of the dumbest fucking things i ve ever read  when detroit was at its absolute rock bottom worst  going to joe louis arena was probably the only reason suburban white people would ever go into the city and spend money now mike ilitch wants to build a gigantic urban development project including restaurants  shopping stores    apartment complexes   and oh yeah a brand new stateoftheart arena for one of the most successful hockey teams of all time  they have nt missed the playoffs since before i was born  25 years ago they are a big deal and have been for decades   oh  and it s being built at the exact time there s an influx of young people and new businesses into the the city which will create more upward momentum  yes  the city is helping pay for it the city also got a lot of input on it design  layout  and what additional projects would be built along with the arena this happens in every single city an arenastadium is built i do nt necessarily think that s how it should work but the fact of the matter is that this is how these deals are made and the city absolutely needs projects like this if it wants to continue on its upward trend  also attacks on mike ilitch in this article and this thread are disgusting illitch has been a controversial figure for a long time but his story is like example of the american dream you d see in fiction his parents were poor immigrants  he grew up in detroit joined the marines played minor league baseball for the team he now owns opens up a mom and pop pizza place and creates an empire out of it  gets rich while creating jobs and doing public works projects for the city he grew up in even though it s a complete shit hole mike ilitch has been spending  and yes  making  money in detroit for years mike ilitch was there in the 90 s and early 00 s before there was ever a housing crash in the rest of the country the man is nt a saint but if it were nt for him there would be a lot less charities and projects being invested in now he wants to build a project the city desperately needs with the city s help and input  and he s getting shit on by some dumb ass  journalist  that ca nt get their facts straight  endran,7,
69732,someone call charlie leduff,5,
69733,good old cronyism at its finest  nothing new to detroit at all,5,

69735,where is my surprise face,3,
69736,a city official operating at a congressional level,3,
69737,gt  detroit contractor who negotiated  285 million in public money for the red wings now works with red wings owner so  i love how these headlines are supposed to make us feel outraged,4,
69738,same shit happened here in richardson  texas  a suburb of dallas   the mayor brought in a huge company to the city and then left office to get a job with that same company it also turns out she was having an affair with a guy from that company too,3,
69739,stop giving public money let business deal with business  not government  which can only be scammed and lead to corruption and bloated monopolies promote free market  and separation of power,3,
69740,to be fair  he was working with him then too,1,
69741,i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him,1,
69742,conflict of interests everywhere,1,
69743,this is how it worksthere is nt anything new to this story that is nt happening in nearly every major city and state across the country  i do nt like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it,1,
69744,public money  om,1,
69745,wow  you mean so someone who worked very closely with an organization and built relationships decided to work for said company later on in their career  shocking  i tell you,1,
69746,everyone from the owners to the safety and comfort of the city and everyone thinks this whole plan is going to a country that did not mainly speak my language  i would learn it,1,
69747,what a shocking surprise,1,
69748,well that s convenien,1,
69749,in other news  bears do  it turns out  shit in the woods,1,
69750,can we just start an embarrass the fuck out of these greedy punks campaign,1,
69755,that article is really light on details  does anyone know why this happened  did the guy not respond to a court summons or something along those lines  is nt a default the judgement the usual result in that situation,9,
69756,this happened in feb  2003 in minnesota as well  article   http  wwwmndailycom20030214usmarshalsarreststudentloandebtorstwincities,9,
69757,what happens if you literally ca nt pay your loans  asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11  just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job  edit  something a lot of you do nt seem to realize is that these were private loans there s no forgiveness with those,9,
69758,not really too much context given here  so it s hard to guess at the actual situation  but federal student loans  at least direct loans and the majority of those older loans passed back to fsa as they phased out the guarantee programs  do nt get sold to private collection agencies at this time maybe that part happened a while back  before current policies went into place and the collectors are taking advantage of the protections that federallyoriginated loans have  anyway  for people who are interested in learning more about how defaulted federal student loans are being collected today   check this out   https  wwwfbogovindex  s  opportunityamp  mode  formamp  id  216a8418f8e71f0c9c3475946ab100f8amp  tab  coreamp  _cview  1  they re currently in the middle of contracting new private collection agencies to service defaulted loans and you can see in the rfp documents how agencies are being scored and how that ties into account assignments  basically  for those who do nt feel like running through all of it  the big emphasis for student loan collections now is getting people through affordable rehabilitation options and into incomedriven repayment plans placements look like they re going to be based about 50  on careful regulatory compliance and borrower satisfaction surveys  which would make it extremely difficult for high pressure collections tactics to work out in the long run  none of that changes this story  just thought it was interesting in light of some of the comments i ve read that indicate people believe strongarm collection tactics for student loans will always be the norm  tldr  they re at least trying to throw a friendly paint job over the horribly broken federal student loan system these days,9,
69759,if you dont show up to court after you have been served this is what happens he has been ignoring collection attempts  he got served and ignored that too im not in favor of this man being arrested but you cant ignore court summons if you get served you have to go,9,
69760,upconwell said it best  gt  you are reading way to much into the article no one said they were violent no one said they had their guns drawn they are us marshals  they carry guns  every god damn day   gt  they probably went to his door  knocked he answered and they said  hey  we have a warrant for you for failing to appear in a federal court   he probably said  oh shit let me get some pants  gt  no violence  no guns drawn  everything was pretty standard and nonviolent  gt  plus  it should be noted that he was not arrested for failing to pay student loans  he was arrested for violating a court order,9,
69761,how do you not pay a  1500 loan after 30 friggin years,9,
69762,gt  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  this almost reads like satire,9,
69763,i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors,9,
69764,where in this article did it say  guns drawn  as most people are stating here  it says  with guns   every on duty us marshal goes through their day  with guns   someone signed a contract for a loan  and then spends almost three decades not paying it i agree that a police force should nt have been used there are financial measures that can be taken upon default of a loan rather than criminal  but i m really surprised by the circle jerk that s happening over a fox news article,9,
69765,can i get a misleading title please,8,
69766,you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day,6,
69767,lol  you guys are so gullible the guy dodged this debt and refused to engage the proper authorities for 25 years this is nt a new college graduate that missed one payment then you have the cascade of predictable posts stating  boot lickers    debtors prison  and how in 30 years this will be the watershed moment we all look back to as we are enslaved by the government this is a statement case the feds took an extreme example and made an extreme example of this putz the goal of this action is compliance and to get folks to not ignore their obligations the money spent on this will scare the other million folks that are past due to actually pick up the phone and engage them to resolve the debt no one held a gun to this guy s head to sign up for the student loans and no one was stopping him for 25 years from making a payment plan for the remaining  1500 this guy deserved it and as a tax payer this is ok by me,9,
69768,real story here dude was sued by the united state of america  he refused to appear  a default judgment was issued against him  he refused to appear for postjudgment depositions  judge issued an order directing him to appear in court  he ignored it and then the judge issued an arrest warrantincareration order and federal judges use us marshalls to enforce their orders  so he was nt arrested for having old student loans he was arrested for refusing to comply with a direct order from the judge  http  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386htm,8,
69769,that dude could not come up with  1500 in 29 years,8,
69770, a few years ago congress allowed the private sector to contract for student loan collections and so you have these private companies who are doing this  i find this scary  even though i have no student loans to pay off they dragged this dude to court and made him sign an agreement in front of their private attorney he had no attorney present  and was nt read any rights  edit  quote is from the video,9,
69771,forever grateful i graduated with minimal student loans ca nt ignore bills for 25 years though  regardless of what those payments stem from from reading through the comments here  it seems like incomebased payment option is the smartest option,5,
69772,i wish my student loan balance was  1500,6,
69773,i knew this story was light on facts turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies  source   yahoo finance   https  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386html,5,
69774,gt  our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is nt the first and wo nt be the last  this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least,8,
69775,he was nt arrested for not paying his loan  he was arrested for not showing up in court  and the marshals did nt storm his house guns blazing they had guns  with them   like every other cop in the entire country,7,
69776,if you take money and have no plans on paying it back  it s called stealing,9,
69777,right the debt collectors just bought the debt  payed the filing fees to bring the case to court  threatened the man with their now official   pay us or else  and when he did not they used their settlement to have him arrested by the marshals nope  no government officers for hire here  just good old debt collection paid and serviced through the courts,5,
69778,til that most people have no understanding how the court system works  yes  civil attorneys can issue subpoenas  yes  a court can hold you in contempt if you fail to appear yes  a potential punishment for contempt is a bench warrant for your arrest  tl  dr  you can not simply ignore subpoenas you may go to jail,5,
69779,writing and publishing articles like this is dangerous the author offered a sensationalist angle on the  story  while leaving out key elements of why they were there in the first place ie missing court summons this is highly unethical and paints the federal government into a larger narrative that fox has been going for basically  rallying people by emotion not logic,6,
69780,this just in  there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government film at 1,5,
69781,student loans were made with certain assumptions about the future of the economy  both on the part of the schools  the tuition they charge   the lenders  and the student people should be required to pay their student loans but they should be adjusted downward  edit  this guy had a loan for  1500 measly bucks and did nt make any payments in 30 years  i would like to know if he was destitute  or just decided  fuck you everyone  i want to keep my money ,8,
69782,misleading title the marshals service will  arrest  you if you fail to show up for a court appearance you are not being tossed in jail  you are being hauled into court when you refused to answer a summons  from the article   paul aker says he was arrested at his home last week for a  1500 federal student loan he received in 1987  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  does anyone feel sorry for this man   1500  be serious,7,
69783,if i did nt pay back a federal loan for 29 years  i d kind of expect for there to be negative effects this dude did nt pay his loan  including when he was taken to court over it and received a judgment from the court specifically telling him to pay it if you ignore a court order  you re gon na have a bad time  i mean yes  the financial aid system needs to be fixed  but they re going after people who purposely are nt paying their loans which is a surprising amount of people  given how many refund chasers there are in the world for anyone else  there are programs like deferment options  sliding payscales  and whatever else along with loan forgiveness after 20 years  it s a shitty system  but this guy s case is not going to be the one to change it because he does nt deserve to have people dying on his hill for his particular cause,8,
69784,i m socialist and firmly believe that education and medical care should be paid for by federal government out of contributions that we make  however with that said  if you are contributing member of society you have to be a special kind of asshole not to repay  1500 loan over the period of 29 years no matter what was that loan used for,8,
69785,why is this news,5,
69786,dude got letters in his mail for months to pay and appear in court  this doesnt just come out of the blue he refused to show up to court multiple times thats a criminal offense,5,
69787,the revolution will not be subsidize,5,
69788,the whole student loan thing is a complete disaste,4,

69790,just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to the paper really is nt worth it otherwise college is becoming a joke anyways,5,
69791,every interaction i have ever had with navient  they have done everything they can to work with me  is your payment affordable  would you like a deferment  etc  i have had to take them up on that because of divorce not saying that is everyone s experience but they have nt been the loan sharks everyone else seems to act like they are just one man s experience though,5,
69794,gt  purchase orders showing that the sheriff s office spent more than  60000 on barbecue grills wtf why,9,

69820,but if guns are involved they ll be sued by the nr,,
69826,thats bad news for all the 711 in our town that take the,8,
69827,does nt this just translate into fewer places for poor people to buy food,7,
69828, 711 cashiers will now have to ring up cigarettes as organic kale instead of hot pockets,7,
69829,on the other hand  if the business stops taking food stamps entirely  not only can they not get the kale you want to make them eat  but they also ca nt get a loaf of bread or gallon of milk unless they start selling their food stamps to get cash to buy the milk and bread so the business still makes their money  the amount of food stamp fraud goes up  and the poor that you claim to be helping are getting even less food  healthy or otherwise  because of the food stampcash exchange rate,5,
69830,why are nt food stamps like wic  with wic you get vouchers for specific food items these items cover the basic food groups and align with a certain amount of nutritional value  meanwhile  you can buy friggin monster energy drinks with food stamps that makes no sense  regardless if you are looking at it from a healthy standpoint or a taxpayer standpoint,6,
69831,if obesity and other nutrition related issues are such a problem among the poor  would nt it be more cost effective to do away with food stamps and implement something like a food box program instead  in other words would the cost of labor to package and ship prepared food boxes in bulk to grocery stores and distribution centers be offset by what would be saved in reduced healthcare costs  imagine a program where you list the people in your household  any allergies or specific requirements and a box is prepared to supplement your family for a week it could contain things like rice  beans  canned or pouched goods like meats  vegetables and fruits  dried oatmeal and cereals  powdered milk  cooking oil every month they could receive a selection of 5 spices  salt and pepper and even a recipe pamphlet if in addition to the box  they started a program where grocery stores and produce growers could drop off older or bruised produce  people could pick some up for free when they picked up their boxes,7,
69832,what if the healthy foods do nt sell  are they still forced to stock them  would nt you think the actual grocers in the neighborhood would have a better sense of what their customers want than the federal government,4,

69835,we have jackinthebox here in phoenix that has we accept ebt  signs up all over pisses me off  same thing at the gas station when you see children without any parents around loading up on overpriced candy and soda and  sure enough  out comes the ebt card or even worse is when they are  with  the adult and loading up on dog shit  food stamps should only be foractual food,3,
69836,honestly this will be great  the state  should  be very involved in what people eat for free,1,
69837,another  good intention  bad policy,1,
69838,this is the dark side of welfare  the constitution is completely circumvented the government has the power to cajole and pressure when it is putting stipulations on the money it gave out the government is capable of doing things it would never have the power of doing otherwise  like forcing a business to carry certain products  or forcing a person to apply for jobs or eventually  forcing people to work at government labor jobs,,
69839,because dontravious demands fresh cilantro,1,
69840,i wonder how much crime in a store would go down if the store was no longer food stamp approved,1,

69847,how many hellfire missiles would that buy,8,
69848,this is a great thing people who are bashing him do not make much sense the monuments in dc are one of the united states  greatest treasures  and likewise they cost a lot to maintain let alone refurbish they are a public venue that is traversed by millions and are awesome to each person that visits  this guy decided to use some of his money to give back and better public places that reside in our nation capital and some see him as an asshole  it is one thing to be bitter about not having that kind of money  it is another thing to get pissed when someone with money gives back,7,
69849,its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring,3,
69850,good for him i remember the lincoln memorial being one of my more favorite monuments i d like to take my son there some day  so it s nice to see it will be upgraded and fixed up  to all the naysayers and negative commenters  fuck you,6,

69854,how dare that onepercenter not keep that money to themselves it s as if they are nt evil like sanders wants you to believ,,
69855,i think it s great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about what i do nt like is that there should nt even be an issue with funding for our monuments,3,

69891,i have my own super secret private social network site that only i know about,6,
69892,so  i read the article and it appears the site was not created by anonymous but anonymous advocates the site  i believe facebook could use some healthy competition  though i question how private anyone s information can be on the internet  even with encryption it seems no matter how much you try to protect someone s information online  there is always someone who  with enough time and ingenuity  can obtain it,5,
69893,anyone else get the feeling this was an ad,4,
69894, doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  i have watched criminal minds penelope can do it,6,
69895,given the propensity of anonymous for leaking confidential and private information of people who do nt share their viewpoints  i do nt know how super private it would stay if someone expressed a contrary opinion would my belief that kanye is an immature narcissist result in release of the name and location of my virginity loss  or my 2nd grade teacher  btw  not the same person ,6,
69896,i bet tom from facebook is already a membe,3,
69897,gt  but unlike its competitors it doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  so how does it make money to pay for development  management  support  bandwidth  and servers  i do nt know how this shit gets reported slow news day  remember that stupid  social network  diaspora  they got global coverage about their facebook alternative i do nt think they ever even finished the product  let alone had anyone use it  must be built by the son of some important news editor who can drum up publicity this is likely the same,3,
69898,so if i log into reddit on the tor network and my verification email account  if i were to use one  was anonymous  would nt that be the same thing,3,
69899,facebook s shills are working overtime in this posts comments i hope this social media site becomes a viable alternative,3,

69909,she refused a breathalyzer meh she ll beat thi,9,

69921,well who s gon na judge the case now,5,
69922,her judgement was impaire,6,
69923,fry needs to weigh in here  http  imgurcomgvji0u,5,
69924,to be clear  the fact that she refused a breathalyzer is important in many states it is treated as evidence of impairment and justification for arrest she knew that i have many friends who are criminal defense attorneys and all have told me they advise to refuse breathalyzer always  unless there is a court order  i m not familiar with ny law  but i can pretty much guarantee she will not be convicted of dui if middle classcollege kids can get out of them  a federal judge surely can since it said nothing about a field sobriety test  i assume they either did nt administer one  or they did and she did not meet criteria for impairment,5,
69925,my friends mom is a judge and that lady boozes super hard and will drive her car around i have seen her come home from the bar completely in ruins at least a dozen times over the last 10 years she is fearless  we live in a small town in wisconsin with a huge police presence she knows all the officers and has never had an issue the whole situation seems completely ridiculous she gives out sentences for dui all day and then drives drunk all night oh god  the hypocrisy,5,

69967,no complaints from me but i ve noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago,9,
69968,for once  reading a story of horrifying animal abuse does nt fill me with rage this must be what justice feels like finally  an appropriate sentence so sick of people like these getting slaps on the wrist due to inadequate animal protection laws,9,
69969,i read the title then thought  hhmmm what s an animal crush video   who would have thunk it  animal crush videos are videos of animals getting crushed there goes some of the little remaining faith i had in humanit,9,
69970,i m not saying this is nt some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder,9,

69980,i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective it was the first exposure i d ever had to this subculture  crush fetish   after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals  their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse that s all i have to say about that,1,
69982,as someone who just for the first time heard the term animal crush videos  i wash that i had nt something is seriously wrong with you if this is what gets you off,7,

69998,did nt we get rid of debtor s prisons  i m confuse,4,
69999,i believe this happened as i heard this story from other news sources  but some info had to be left out or missing in the us if you owe money on a debt the personcompany has seven years to collect if they do nt the debt disappears if they take you to court and get a judgement they have ten years to collect and it can be renewed for ten more years the only way he could be arrested is if the loan company took him to court  won a judgement and then took further action to force the debtor to court this would not be something to come out of the blue,3,

70002,tl  dr  apple has to provide the means to extract encrypted data from the device fbi will then try to decrypt it  i assume by brute force  would would be easy for a 4digit pin   the interesting part is that the device is owned by farook s employer  the san bernardino county department of public health had they been following proper device protocol  they would already have administrator access to it  this was literally government property used for terrorism  and now unsearchable not due to the  encryption  boogeyman but their own ineptitude,7,

70004,i have this hunch that this is all for show and that the fbi has access through the nsa to all of this stuff why would they cancel prism  it s not like your average citizen can inspect the electronic infrastructure of this country and verify that  for example  metadata collection has stopped i think after edward snowden they sat in a room and decided to keep doing it and act like they were stopping it i would  i sound like a conspiracy theorist but i really do think the risks of terrorism are so great and siphoning data so easy that they re still doing it,1,
70005,apple  you are hereby ordered to factor the following data into its prime numbers  or be found in contempt,1,

70063,80  of the money supply being in  100 bills is the key statement this would likely be the first  and easiest  step to killing paper currency this is one of the initial hurdles to overcome  because they do nt give a fuck about it being tough on criminals  come on  when looking to implement negative interest rates,8,
70064,the thing about secondary labor markets  drugs  gambling  prostitution  etc  is that prohibition is what causes the main problems related to them these are black markets that will always have demand as long as the activities are forced underground by punitive policy  and that demand will always find a way around obstacles  making life marginally more difficult for the suppliers is only doing to make the products more dangerous  not less desirable,4,

70069,i urge everybody here to watch inside job  it will shock you on how thoroughly corrupt this dude is  along with his buddies on wall street washington now he wants the gov to ban the  100 because of nirp  he does nt give a fuck about criminals using those or tax evasions do not listen to what this turd says,4,
70070,i wonder what larry would think about paul krugman s onetime pet project  the  trilliondollar coin   http  krugmanblogsnytimescom20130107bereadytomintthatcoin  _r  0 ,5,
70071,is something going on with all the major currencies  i saw a similar story about the euro notes too  http  wwwdailymailcoukwiresreutersarticle3448066ecbconsidersscrapping500euronotehtml also http  wwwdailymailcouknewsarticle3437590banksurgedban50notesbidendcashhandculturehelprecoupbillionstaxtreasuryhtml all these stories within a week of each other  i would nt be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency,3,
70072,currently in colorado  hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash,3,
70073,scrap larry summers  and get rid of a criminal,3,
70074,the only relevance to crime is the idea itself scam to grab more control of your money  bankster shenanigans do nt fall for it,3,
70075,the banks love this this means less people holding cash and more money that they can use to fuck us over remember folks  the rules are changing so that the money on deposit with banks is legally not yours if there s a bank failure  your money will be used to bail out the banks  the move is simply an extension of the war on cash,3,
70076,the fed stopped printing any bills higher than  100 in 1945 they began destroying the larger denominations actively in 1969  100 in 1945 is equivalent to  1300 today adjusting for inflation frankly they should be talking about issuing a  200 and  500 bill  if not also a  1000 bill,3,
70077,larry summers should be in prison  he is one of the architects of the 2008 collapse he also was instrumental in the repeal of glasssteagall the world would be better off without this fool and his dangerous ideas  http  wwwsourcewatchorgindexphp  title  larry_summer,3,
70078,does larry mean wall st criminals  of course not  white male entitlement it s what larry is all about unfortunately obama was dumb enough to bring summers into his administration where he flailed about  lamely attempting to cover upmake excuses as to why the theater burned down in 2008 with the financial  masters of the universe  still inside  larry proved his overall dumbness by predicting 2011 would be  recovery summer   based on nothing  no evidence just his  expert  opinion  there was no recovery in 2011,3,
70079,bring back the  500 and  1000 dollar bills dammit,3,
70080,larry summers  ladies and gentlemen one of the masterminds of financial deregulation is now proposing another hair brained idea summers  go clone yourself so you can go fuck yourself,3,
70081,attention  we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash  except pennies   cash is privacy and should be a basic right,1,
70082,just legalize crime everybody wins,4,
70083,fuk this illuminati puppe,3,
70084,the bulk of the value of cash in circulation is from  100 s get rid of cash and the fed can do any crazy policy it wants this is a necessary step towards negative interest rates nobody believes the government gives two shits about money laundering  florida real estate laws and hsbc getting zero criminal charges shows that is not the case,4,
70085,banksters do nt even use cash oh wait you re talking about the little criminals carry on,5,
70086,another attempt by the wealthy to outlaw cash our money is nt our money  according to the elite,5,
70087,then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination ,3,
70088,scrap the two  the single  the penny  half dollar and nickel instead,3,
70089,scrap the drugs too  make them illegal  oh wait,1,
70090,but they just click buttons on a computer and create and move money around  wait  what,1,
70091,than how will our government and cia function,1,
70092,interning theory main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks,1,
70093,singapore has had the 10000 singapore dollar bill for some time it is still legal tender  but is going to be phased out slowly old notes will not be replaced  this is a calculated strategy by the sg government to comply with international counterterrorism and anti money laundering efforts  but minimising their own vulnerability to regulatory arbitrage,1,
70094,is nt the  100 bill the staple of american foreign trade  i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like  interestfree  loans  though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ,1,
70095,politicians do nt use  100s so how could it harm criminals,1,
70096,what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then,1,
70097,gt  the  100 bill is actually the second most common us bill in circulation  behind the  1 bill  gt  nearly 80  of the  14 trillion of us currency in circulation is in  100 bills much of it is held outside the united states  i m no math magician  but this does nt seem to fit,1,
70098,yeah  just watch  they will scrap it right down to the 20  anyone who wants to make largeish purchases will have to use electronic accounts that can be tracked  oh yeah   because crime  not  because government needs to track your every move,1,
70099,this is one of those ideas that seems silly at first but the more you think of it  the more it makes some sense,1,
70100,this is stupid  criminals will make due with what ever currency there is  they do nt fucking care and any one who thinks otherwise is a desk jocky looking for something to do,1,
70101,switch to all coins while you re at it if  100 weighed an ounce   1600 would weigh a pound  1 mil would weigh 625 lbs,1,
70102,larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone,1,
70103,how would this effect the bitcoin market,1,
70104,this is about getting rid of cash  not making life tougher for criminals that way  when the fed institutes negative interest rates  you the lowly consumer will be forced to spend your savings to avoid being charged for saving,1,
70105,funny thing  today also the eu central bank ceo emanuele prodi announced that 500 euro bills are to be outphased for the same reason apparently american criminals manage to launder money with a bill that s 6 times less in value  is nt this just a global banking scheme to rob us the power over our own money,1,
70106,yes those evil people in government would love to get rid of cash and make everyone just use electronic money because then  the bank has your money and you only have an iou which they may  or may not  pay you back in the future  look at cyprus in 2013 where people did nt get their full deposited funds back because of the financial crisis  also they can charge you negative interest rateswhich means you have to pay for the bank to hold your funds  and of course if the govt has your money  then they have a great deal more power over you in deciding whether they should be nice and give it back to you or not  this is another reason why bitcoin is good  although they will ban that long before they ban cash,1,
70107,now  whatchall wan na do  wan na be ballers  shotcallers  brawlers  who be dippin in the benz wit tha spawlers,,
70108,hmm sounds like portable bitcoin exchange devices would be cool carry a bitcoin wallet in a little  5 raspberry pilike thing with an lcd display  hook it up to another  punch in transfer codes  both devices show  are you sure   both people hit yes  see the verification displayed  and bill sizes become irrelevant and everybody can keep negotiating with cash when buying motorcycles off craigslist no matter what these control freak asshats try to pull,,
70109,you can still buy silver and gold anonymously  and cash out up to  1500 worth at one time with no tax penalty,,
70110,but  but  how will weezy and drizzy write raps now if they ca nt talk about dem big faces,,
70112,has nt he already had  like  two years to prevent this in the first place,7,
70113,lansing has actually dealt with this problem and their civil engineers have a solution which is both fast and more costeffective than traditional measures they connect the end of the new pipe to the old pipes so when they pull out the old pipe they simultaneously thread the new pipes into the existing space this speeds up the process and the people in lansing estimate with adequate training  involving them with the process in flint  and hiring enough crews it can be completed for flint in one year,7,
70114,this whole situation is a national embarrassment  and it makes my blood boil  but what does naacp have to do with city water  is it a race issue as well  i ve never seen the demographics on flint  come to think of it  maybe aspca should get involved  too i bet people are still feeding their pets city water no matter what  edit  i just think it should be about officials   doing their fucking jobs    framing it as a race issue might just come back to bite us  who knows how many towns are discreetly checking for  and finding  elevated lead  should it matter how many african americans live there  if so  how should officials proceed differently  will it result in a process of public relations triage  that prioritizes black communities  public officials just need to do their fucking jobs for the public they serve there s no need to complicate this with race,5,
70115,that s like threatening to get one of those online white house petitions going it does nt matter,1,
70116,fix flint s water pipes or they ll burn flint to the ground,3,
70117,i m all for getting this fixed as quickly as possible but i also do nt want something rushed either figure it out figure it out right,1,
70118,okayand then what  all of the protesting has nt done jack so far what s one more protest going to do  it s not going to make the state government move any faster  it s very clear that the government  at every level  is more concerned about covering itself a protest is nt going to change that,,
70119,sooooo glad i do nt live in flint  that place sounds like a complete disaster,,
70120,who the fuck are they to demand this  are whiteasianlatino people not allowed to be affected by this,,
70122,from  government  s memorandum in support of its motion for pretrial detention   http  wwwscribdcomdoc29947153421616doc4usavclivenbundyusadetentionmemorandumforclivenbundy  gt  bundy is lawless and violent he does not recognize federal courts  claiming they are illegitimate  does not recognize federal law  refuses to obey federal court orders  has already used force and violence against federal law enforcement officers while they were enforcing federal court orders  nearly causing catastrophic loss of life or injury to others he has pledged to do so again in the future to keep federal law enforcement officers from enforcing the law against him as of the date of this hearing  he continues to violate federal court orders and continues to possess the proceeds of his illegal activities  gt  gt  bundy is currently charged with crimes of violence including using and brandishing firearms in connection with crimes of violence under title 18  united states code  section 924  c   as such  the bail reform act presumes that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that will ensure the safety of the community 18 usc  3142  e   3   b   here  no evidence has been adduced during the investigation of the instant charges that even remotely hints at a rebuttal to that presumption in fact  all the evidence suggests that bundy will continue to act lawlessly  will not abide by court orders  and will use violence to ensure that federal laws are not enforced as to him,8,
70123, bundy asked for a courtappointed attorney at his first hearing last week  still living off govt handouts i see,8,
70124,gt  bundy   his  attorney said  would go to court in nevada if ordered to do so   right  sure i mean  it s not like he s ever defied the government before  and he  totally  recognises it s legitimacy  gt  but judge stewart said if bundy was released   i  m guessing that  s the last we  ll ever see of mr bundy  a wise and perspicacious judge,9,
70125, daughterinlaw briana bundy said tuesday that a federal judge in oregon should let the 69yearold live at home while he awaits trial  sure that s an excellent suggestion i would further suggest that the judge prepare a lunch of peanut butter sandwiches with home made raspberry jam and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies for mr bundy each day,8,
70126,gt  the judge said bundy  69  is a flight risk and a danger to the community in the bail hearing tuesday afternoon in downtown portland i mean i ca nt really find a reason not to agree with that a 69 year old who does nt believe he s beholden to the law is as dangerous as a 29 year old who does nt believe he s beholden to the law,8,
70127,they are just misunderstood they did this for free sex toys,7,
70128,not sure he was the worst member of ya llquaida  http  mwashingtontimescomnews2014apr15formersheriffwillingletwifedaughterdiefron,6,
70129,hope he gets the  negros  there to hear his theory or their culture and living style,1,
70130,the man is a wellmeaning but ideologically obsessed idiot the government has handled this clusterfuck extremely well  and i am not one to say that lightly,6,
70131,it s important for the government to provide a consistent and cohesive narrative if they are to help squash future acts of rebellion cliven bundy and his ilk are lawless  violent  redneck anarchists and none of the things they protested had any validity whatsoever,5,
70132,good  this arrest and trial has been delayed for too long,7,
70133,given his history  bundy is as dangerous as a monkey with a straightrazor,4,
70134,where is the groundswell of the righteously indignant right wing militia that was supposed to come to his aid,1,
70135,mmmmmm i need some of the bundy range fed beef i hope the feds seize it all soon and put it up for sale,1,
70136,so anyone knows how long a trial like this could last,1,
70137,yalqueda finally facing justice,1,
70138,well then that s that,1,
70139,does this mean that harry reid s son s land deal can finally go through,,
70141,he ll probably need something to help him sleep tonight,5,
70142,gt  the judge who refused to dismiss the case this month has denied cosby s appeal of that decision  so is that like asking your parents if they are really really sure that you are grounded,4,
70143,good  the prosecution seems to have a solid basis for a case this is one that should definitely go to trial the defense is going to have a tough time with all the press coverage cosby s been getting over these allegations,1,
70144,kanye tweeted cosby is innocen,1,
70146,free expression runs counter to the new religion of progressivism the two simply are not compatible,5,
70147,before you all get too deep in to your selfrighteous conservative circlejerk  you guys are aware that this commissioner was a former verizon executive who spoke out avidly against net neutrality  right  dont you think it s a bit rich to believe that he gives any fucks about free expression,1,
70148,from the regressive left s perspective  by censoring and silencing opposing opinions  especially those from sources merely  perceived  as not being   progressive   regressive enough  they are allowing for  traditionally oppressed groups  to   be used as a mouthpiece that ca nt be challenged because of cries of racism   speak  just as long as they say the correct    progressive   regressive things ,,

70151,i got hit by a car in a parking lot once i punched the car really hard just so the driver realized he was hitting me it had nothing to do with challenging the driver to a fight or whatever,5,
70153,i have my own super secret private social network site that only i know about,6,
70154,so  i read the article and it appears the site was not created by anonymous but anonymous advocates the site  i believe facebook could use some healthy competition  though i question how private anyone s information can be on the internet  even with encryption it seems no matter how much you try to protect someone s information online  there is always someone who  with enough time and ingenuity  can obtain it,5,
70155,anyone else get the feeling this was an ad,4,
70156, doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  i have watched criminal minds penelope can do it,6,
70157,given the propensity of anonymous for leaking confidential and private information of people who do nt share their viewpoints  i do nt know how super private it would stay if someone expressed a contrary opinion would my belief that kanye is an immature narcissist result in release of the name and location of my virginity loss  or my 2nd grade teacher  btw  not the same person ,6,
70158,i bet tom from facebook is already a membe,3,
70159,gt  but unlike its competitors it doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  so how does it make money to pay for development  management  support  bandwidth  and servers  i do nt know how this shit gets reported slow news day  remember that stupid  social network  diaspora  they got global coverage about their facebook alternative i do nt think they ever even finished the product  let alone had anyone use it  must be built by the son of some important news editor who can drum up publicity this is likely the same,3,
70160,so if i log into reddit on the tor network and my verification email account  if i were to use one  was anonymous  would nt that be the same thing,3,
70161,facebook s shills are working overtime in this posts comments i hope this social media site becomes a viable alternative,3,
70162,private social media pick one,1,

70164,eh  with anonymous s history of doxxing people  i rather not use anything that they have a hand i,,
70165,so some social dropout  400 lb teenage hackers are going to be watching over other the private data of other people  i do nt think the anonymous group realizes how much they are despised across the internet,,
70166,i would trust this site over facebook,,

70171,it s what twitter has always been  a megahorn for loudmouths and self important egotists,6,
70172,i m always shocked that people take any type of social media seriously  it s twitter  it s mostly fucking garbage opinions and stupid nonsense,6,
70173,shame the guy is a national treasure and to be respected he makes a crack at someone  and suddenly he is a sexist pig  i expect this nonsense from uni students in the states  but not europe did nt realize tumblr reaches so far,7,

70177,who is steven fry  is he related to phillip j fry,,
70179,living in germany and studying  i m gon na pay 300   335   for the upcoming semester  these 335  also includes a public transportation ticket  which is in your student id  that allows me to take the train  bus  tram etc at any time as much as i like in my entire state  books are nt nearly as expensive as in the us  the most expensive book i bought last semester was 80   89    but  seriously  95  of the content for the majority of the courses are uploaded on the university s website  files and documents which you can download for free  also  the university canteen offers you decent food for a fair price  normally around 35   in the end my biggest expenses during my semester are the coffees i buy on campu,9,
70180,i m from the uk and have lived in germany for 6 years now i came here with a 20000 gbp student loan for a 4 year degree in computer science  now i m about to start a masters in web science that will cost me about 1000 eur for the 2 year course  parttime and remote  i m also just about to get german citizenship  most germans are happy to speak english  i have a job here and although most of the company speak english they make i point of speaking german with me  and i with them  i m not very good at german but am slowly learning now after 5 years of being very lazy about learning the language it s a very hard language to learn  screw those articles   but in time you ll get used to it  i absolutely love speaking to locals in german and being understood by them  to me it s like being on another planet and finally being accepted by the local populus  good luck to anyone who wants to come over  it is a wise move  come and see me near koblenz,9,
70181,a friends son went to college in switzerland  we are american  even though he paid additional fees as a non native  and had to travel back and forth to europe  he still paid less than kids who went to local colleges,9,
70182,come gather around the fire and listen to a tale of a spooky and simple explanation of our increasing tuition rates in the us  the government started giving student loans kids take the debt  the schools get the money tuition prices increase because they can rely on the kids to get a gov loan take away student loans  then schools ca nt rely on this money  kids ca nt afford the jacked up tuitions  enrollments drop  schools are forced to cut tuition  now more affordable again it s the same problem with mortgage crisis  just a different industry,9,
70183,it s almost as if germany sees the benefit of having a well educated work force that is not bogged down by insurmountable debt,9,
70184,my college actually sodomizes me,9,
70185,whereas here in the states  they will gladly charge you a  250semester parking fee and you will still not actually be guaranteed a space,8,
70186,maybe i should go to germany,9,
70187,currently living in germany  as an american student on an international internship  what this is nt telling you is that the uni system is significantly different my roommates  all in engineering or other sciences  study all day every day they have a month of exams coming up  and they usually have only one exam per year you fail that  you fail no assignments  projects  etc  just that exam  did i mention this was a fraternity  yeah  they do nt go to uni because everyone does it  like america they work  they get accepted  and they work even more it is nt for partying  it is nt for meeting your spouse or friends  it s for becoming the best you can be  which is how a university should be  good luck to the americans coming here thinking it s anything like the states enjoy the d  ner,9,
70188,something like this gets posted everysingleweek without fail and then a bunch of americans start making hasty decisions to just go study in germany because it s  free   oh and it has been this way for years so it is nt a new thing  the german courses that you will have to take for at least a year to reach fluency are around  300 a month and noduolingo is absolutely not enough to get you to the level you need to study at university  the fees for applications are at  75 then an additional 15  for each university you apply to after the first it can go well into the hundreds  the bank account you have to open for your student visa has to have a frozen amount of at least approx   8500 this is nt to say it is impossible but do nt expect roses and rainbows and raining beer amp  wurst to await your easy university life in germany  also american universities except the few ivy leagues or outstanding schools  baby the absolute shit outta you you can pretty much sail smoothly your first two years while you get your core courses out of the way in germany  you jump right into it in german remember  a different language a crazy  difficult language at that the high school diploma is also not equivalent to the german one that allows you to study at a university the equivalent would be a plethora of ap courses with really good grades or a high school diploma plus two years of college with really good grades and then you re equivalent to a german high school graduate  you will also most likely not be able to transfer credits  german bureaucracy  a bitch you will have to have german knowledge when applying for your visas or someone to be a translator there with you  you may have to do a prep year for certain programs as well it is also very competitive to get into even these programs  i sound like fucking scrooge but i ve been through all of it as so have many people i met along the way  it is possible but it will take a lot of hard work and dedication and time that you wo nt regret  losing  because it may not work out perfectly you may get rejected you may not be accepted for that semester a lot of the popular programs have a cap so it s very restricted in terms of amount of students accepted  do nt expect germany to be a country that is just waiting and fiddling its thumbs for the americans to come and study in their unis for  free  and think that they re gon na make it easy for you it is anything but,9,
70189,my american husband started learning german at the age of 26 a year later he was admitted to vet school here he s almost finished now we ve been paying 120 euros a semester i think he s the only foreign student to not drop out in his class though the drop out rate is high even for germans while he s happy he is debt free  the immense stress of having to learn a very hard subject in a foreign language and a foreign system  bureaucracy is insane here   have caused many panic attacks and one major case of depression and he has nt even started the huge final exam yet but at least we wo nt be  200k in debt when this is over,8,
70190,the fee is actually 150500  per semester books inclusive because of librarys and because we live in 2016 and share digitaly public transport also free  you get 600  per month plus health care  if your parents arent rich  this will be checked by government  as student  and will have to pay back   half of that   in worst conditions after you finished  also  after 3 semesters you must have passed 23 of your finals at any time to get your  baf  g  money  but this will only be checked once no money for extra semesters of course,9,
70191,in my opinion let them come here  let them study here and let them stay here if they want besides the fact that the ones who stay make up for the cost of education it is a great way of cultural exchange  it s always nice to have friends from different countries  so if you are coming to the area of n  rnberg just text me ,8,
70192,currently living in duisburg  germany and studying at the university of duisburgessen   my choice   i grew up in the us  but my parents are from germany after graduating high school it became apparent that studying in germany was an opportunity that i could not pass up i chose my current uni because it has an international studies in engineering program which allows me to pursue a bachelors degree in computer engineering with the first year taught entirely in english   costs   the costs are definitively low the semester fee  including public transport  is below 300   my total living expenses are below 700  a month and that includes health insurance   my experience so far   keep in my mind i m still in my first semester  as others have mentioned before  the majority of students quit after the first year last year  the failure rate of an exam taken by 200 students was over 95   attending lectures is completely voluntary and there is one exam at the end of each course that makes up 100  of your final course grade no homework is given and you are very much on your own forcing yourself to focus and learn everyday can be a serious challenge  feel free to comment or pm with any questions,7,
70193,many american students also come with very false expectations about what german university is like you have to be way more self organised and please do nt expect multiple choice tests,9,
70194,we need to stop this immigration because when america sends its people  it sends unskilled people and we have to spend our money on them we are going to build a wall  get america to pay for it and make germany great again,9,
70195,you can only offer something for free if you limit supply fewer germans go to college than us students   only 30  of germans ages 2534 have completed a tertiary education  which includes academic degrees and some but not all vocational programs that  s below the oecd average  and below the us 45  attainment rate for the same age group  http  wwwlatimescomlocaleducationcommunitylameedufreecollegeeducationingermanybutnotincalifornia20151029htmlstoryhtml edit  so now i am amused that many people are suggesting that fewer people should go to college in the us  presumably other people  not so much themselves they are smart   it seems like this would be a less popular proposal than promising free tuition,9,
70198,fucking sad how this was nt described as an act of terrorism i guess that title is reserved for nonchristians,9,
70199,it is sad that it closed even for a short time people like fiorina do nt give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time,8,
70200,definitely not terrorism though  just a little rampage  you know he was probably having a bad day or something,8,
70201,good for them  dont let those freedom hating assholes scare you away from your job,8,
70202,how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him,4,
70203,is carly out of the race yet  i do nt think that rightwing  fringe conartist is done riling up her terrorist sect,6,
70204,deadly rampage  was  terrorist attack  a little too onthenose,6,
70205,why does this headline say  deadly rampage  and not  christian terrorism ,6,
70206,now i m not a fan of abortions but who the hell can think to themselves i know how to stop babies from being aborted  i ll just shoot all the moms and their doctors  absolute lunatic,3,

70220,this has been happening for a while now  i came to japan in 2005 for university  graduated in 2009  and i m still here i ca nt imagine ever moving back to usa life is so much better here  which i ve had a really hard time admitting until recently my fellow americans  get out if you re not appreciated there s literally a whole world out there ready to give you opportunities,9,
70223,sounds a lot like hitech money laundering to m,1,
70225,colleges really need to stop expelling students due to these kangaroo courts  i m fine with them if it s from breaking a school infraction like alcohol on a dry campus or something of that sort but  if a student is accused of a criminal offense  let the courts deal with it and decide from there  schools are nt equipped to deal with these kinds of cases  nor should they be expected to be these are lifechanging accusations and need to be treated as such  for the benefit of both parties involved,9,
70226,gt  ut investigators later decided  that the evidence supported a finding that  he  had sexually assaulted ms roe  the opposite of the conclusion reached by the more experienced detectives of the police department   the lawsuit says the dean of students then recommended he be expelled  ah but the police are looking for evidence that he did it  college tribunals assume he did and require he provide evidence that he did nt  which  typically  the accused is not allowed to present,9,
70227,gt  one plaintiff is a 24yearold recent graduate  the other is a 21yearold student who is one semester away from graduating with a bachelor  s degree in physics  their lawsuits say   in the graduate  s case  he faces being banned from any ut system campus  being denied a shot at a ut graduate degree and having a notation put on his transcript   the undergrad faces expulsion in addition to the same punishments  that does nt make any sense to me why would an institution retroactively amend the transcript of someone  who already graduated  to say this person violated school policy  after graduating   this seems to be more evidence that they re trying to scapegoat the plaintiffs here i mean  if they were concerned with the alleged victim s wellbeing more than trying to look  tough on sexual assault   what is the point of amending the transcript,9,
70228,who s the idiot who decided that kangaroo courts were a good idea,9,
70229,are we to the point where  sexual assaultrape  almost no longer have a meaning    you getting hammered and hooking up with a hammered guy is not rape  nor is it assault he should sue her for the exact same thing,8,
70230,i once saw a swedish movie called ondskan   evil  that drove me to become a lawyer today  here  https  enwikipediaorgwikievil_  2003_film   plot one of the key issues that caught my attention in this movie is the disregard of the law the school had to the protagonist s rights when he hired a lawyer  because of some grievance he had with the school  it backed off immediatly when the lawyer lay down the letter of the law to the headmaster of that educational institution in front of all his guests  in this university of texas sexual assault case  i believe imhlo  l is for legal   that the constitution sets a foundation of rules for everyone inside it s jurisdiction  and no internal policy that ut may have can go against the rules set by the us constitution everyone should enjoy the right of being innocent until proven guilty  and time and time again people are being layed off their jobs  students expelled  lives ruined because of yettobeproven  accusations  the right thing that any institution  like ut  should always do is address all cases of criminal behavior by always recognizing first the accused innocence until proven guilty in a court of law  edit  grammar,8,
70231,gt  the friend said she thought the woman was conscious because  when she saw her kissing this man  she was awake and talking  the lawsuit says  so intentionally or not the woman who claimed to be assaulted is not telling the truth  editand they decided to expel him without even talking to the student his first chance to give his side was an appeal for his expulsion this is a fucking kangaroo court  edit2  the second lawsuit claims expulsion against a student was recommended without the alleged victim ever personally making a sex assault accusation  http  kxancom20160205lawsuitsagainstutallegebiasagainstmalesinsexassaultcase,9,
70232,gt  the undergrad  s lawsuit says he had sex with a woman who was not a ut student after leaving a house party near campus sometime after midnight on march 6  2015 about a month later  the woman  s father called ut police and accused the man of sexually assaulting his daughter  fuck this i understand that if a woman is  actually  rapedmolestedassaulted it could be hard to come forward  but waiting a month or longer and  then  reporting it is bullshit you get raped  you report it immediately the longer you wait  the more i m going to doubt your accusation,7,
70233,gt  university police never spoke to the woman the undergrad was accused of assaulting and no criminal charges were ever pursued  his lawsuit says the father  s report was referred to the ut dean of students  okay what the hell  seriously  though its this sort of thing that makes me really hate schools handling sexual assault cases on their own the police did nt even talk to the accused victim  but decided to tell the dean instead  it feels like it happens all the time when we have these alternate systems of punishment we stop treating crimes like crimes and treat them like rule infractions a rule infraction is cheating on a test an alleged assault is a crime treat it like one,7,
70234,eli5 kangaroo courts thanks,8,
70235,activist administrators  check lack of due process  check prohibited from legal council or cross examination of the accuser  check nothin to see here  move along people,6,
70236,well  they are probably right these school kangaroo courts have demonstrated they have no respect for the privacy and rights of the accused  and are only interested in demonstrating how seriously they take sexual assault accusations,6,
70237,male privilege,8,

70240,stay away from liberal colleges  they are cesspools of tumblrina ideals  i could barely stand the required diversity classes from my public university nothing but priviledge  patriarchy  and man hatin,8,
70241,it seems to me that a public institution has to follow the sixth amendment  which grants  the right to a public trial without unnecessary delay  the right to a lawyer  the right to an impartial jury  and the right to know who your accusers are and the nature of the charges and evidence against you,6,
70242,jane roe because jane doe would be incest,4,
70243,so these students that are expelled do they have to still pay back their loans even though they do nt get a degree now and can they carry their credits over to another school or are they now worthless,5,
70244,i love how at the end she implies that if there were a person punching people randomly on campus they would choose to not involve the police presumably so that the assault victims could  control their own destiny,3,
70245,30 year old here  and planning on returning to school with all this insanity about social values exploding everywhere  i may just hold off a few more years and wait for school to become a profitable idea again,3,
70246,gt  the university has been placed under enormous political pressure to appear tough on those accused of sexual assault  there s your problem right there how about be tough on those convicted of sexual assault and those whom the law decides are innocent be treated as such,3,
70247,umso expel the drunken slut too  right  i could get behind that they both got drunk and made bad choices that reflect poorly on the school kick em both out  why only the male  did he conspire in some way to get her drunk  if they re both adults that got drunk and fucked then they re both equally guilty,7,
70248,considering that almost every case of a rape accusation that s come out massively public has been shown to be fraudulent  i m reserving judgement on this one,3,
70249, ut investigates more than 100 allegations of sexual assault a year  and that number is growing  liebman said   how the hell are there hundreds of allegations a year that s insane this reminds me of the play the crucible  i saw you with the devilcommunistscapitalists  homo raptorus,1,

70271,so this guy is innocent until proven guilty right  why is this investigation so short  we do nt know the details  why does it take a year to investigate an officer for shooting someone  and this takes a couple of days to charge this guy  is that disconnect enough to make anyone here question things enough to accept that there is a massive encompassing problem with our legal system  i always have to wonder because we see many of the same people calling for people to wait for details after an officer shoots someone  telling us not to be monday morning quarterbacks then stories like this pop up and we have those same people frothing at the mouth in this situation where it has nt been given the year plus of investigation that an officer who shoots someone would be given the guy is already guilty despite the cries to give officers the benefit of the doubt because of the innocent until proven principle,,

70281,corruption of public officials in michigan  no way,9,
70282,i certainly do nt necessarily agree with public funds being used for a sports stadium  and i definitely do nt agree with nepotism  but i think criticizing mike illitch somehow taking advantage of detroit is a shortsighted mistake had it not been for mr illitch pretty much singlehandily reinvesting in a city everyone wanted to leave behind over the last 20 years  the city would nt even be close to back on a path to relevancy  whether you want to believe it is or not   the other thing to consider is that this new complex not only brings commerce to an area that was a combination of blight and open fields  it also brings quite a few jobs to the city  as well as some stateoftheart buildings that will bring commerce and international travelers to the area for a variety of reasons  conferences  concerts  etc   this all equals more money for the city of detroit  which is why they re willing to make the investment in the first place   and another part of a blightfilled neighborhood updated and usable for the future  this is a sticky situation that reeks of an unfortunate quidproquo  but when it comes to what is good for the city of detroit  it s hard to argue that anyone has anything on the passion and dedication of mike illitch,9,
70283,how in the fuck are there no comments about the red wings owner s hair  ,9,
70284,everyone talks about the insanity in pro sports these days  yet no one mentions  public or private  universities  which are all nonprofit  spending massive amounts of their cash on stadiums  athletic facilities  etc it s the same thing if the universities are public  and its only marginally different if they re private the reason they have that money in the first place is federallysubsidized student loans,8,
70285,lol illitch has done more for the city of detroit than any other person in the last 50 years fuck off,9,
70286,so he did a good job for the team and the owner offered him more money for a better job  happens all the time  kids,6,
70287,is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit  or ford field  most people would not step foot downtown if it was nt for those two places i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do nt bring forth revitalization like intendedbut the only article i ve read was about stadiums in la and sf,6,
70288,before you jump on the  why ca nt detroit use the money for things that actually matter  train   here s   http  wwwcrainsdetroitcomarticle20140921news309219990oncostfinancingofwingsarenahereareanswers  an article outlining the finances of this massive project  edit  s  for those not wanting to click  gt  the initial base price is  450 million problems  changes and added amenities could increase that final cost anything beyond  450 million must be paid by the ilitches  gt  the michigan strategic fund will sell  450 million in two series of bonds they will be divided into  250 million in series a bonds that will be backed by property taxes already captured by the downtown development authority the  200 million in series b bonds will be backed by the  115 million olympia development has agreed to pay the dda for bond retirement  gt  the ilitches  through olympia  will pay  200 million of the bond debt detroit s dda  via its property tax capture ability  will pay back  250 million of the bonds new yorkbased merrill lynch  a division of bank of america  which has pledged to buy all the publicly backed series a bonds in the deal it will then sell the bonds to the public dallasbased comerica bank inc will buy the series b bonds backed by olympia s money the bank  formerly based in detroit  has the naming rights to comerica park  where the ilitchowned detroit tigers play comerica intends to keep the bonds on its books rather then sell them,8,
70289, misleading title   https  wwwredditcomrhockeycomments45xs0mdetroit_contractor_who_negotiated_285_million_ind00vnke   it was state money  not detroit s also  ilitch footed most of the bill himself  or through his company   please research  the district  and see their plans for it before passing judgement,9,
70290,clickbait no one around here is remotely upset about taxpayer funds going to a new stadium for the most popular team in town we re not really unhappy about the new development for business and residences that is happening and we re not raising any concerns about the effort to revitalize the city  detroit is climbing out of a hole created by the corruption of influential individuals local business and leaders have been more beneficial in this process than any other group and this stadium  and the district surrounding it are seen as victories in this effort,8,
70291,ah  a local spin on the old  congressperson becomes lobbyist  setup,5,
70292,they are literally building new district for the city not just an arena  a whole new district development is what the city needs and frankly  detroit politics have always been just a  wee  bit corrup,4,
70293,but  guys  come on we need our circuses  what would we do with out national sports  concentrate on real issues  lol  that s no fun ,4,

70295,you think that s a wig,4,
70296,public money should never be allowed to pay for sports teams unless the team has to pay back the city directly  with interest none of this but businesses will benefit  bullsht it s my fucking money you re stealing  i do nt want to  potentially  subsidize businesses downtown,8,
70297,if you re a bernie supporter  who thinks a public funded  1 trillion dollar infrastructure package is a good deal because jobs  but is outraged by the state of michigan investing  285 million in the renovationrevitalization of its  largest city  then you might want to reexamine one of those positions,6,
70298,for all the people complaining about spending the money on the new stadium and  less mentioned  surrounding developments  all i can say is it will be more than worth it if it fixes up that area governments of all levels have been dumping money into the cass corridor since the early days of johnson s great society programs with any luck this will finally be a solution that stick,7,
70299,itt  out of staters have no fucking idea about the current state of economics in detroit and how great this project is going to be for the city  i do nt even know where to begin with this article it s clear the author did nt talk to a single person in the city or state or even try to get a feel for the public opinion on the topic including garbage clickbait phrases like the previous article titled  detroit scam city  how the red wings took hockeytown for all it had  has to be one of the dumbest fucking things i ve ever read  when detroit was at its absolute rock bottom worst  going to joe louis arena was probably the only reason suburban white people would ever go into the city and spend money now mike ilitch wants to build a gigantic urban development project including restaurants  shopping stores    apartment complexes   and oh yeah a brand new stateoftheart arena for one of the most successful hockey teams of all time  they have nt missed the playoffs since before i was born  25 years ago they are a big deal and have been for decades   oh  and it s being built at the exact time there s an influx of young people and new businesses into the the city which will create more upward momentum  yes  the city is helping pay for it the city also got a lot of input on it design  layout  and what additional projects would be built along with the arena this happens in every single city an arenastadium is built i do nt necessarily think that s how it should work but the fact of the matter is that this is how these deals are made and the city absolutely needs projects like this if it wants to continue on its upward trend  also attacks on mike ilitch in this article and this thread are disgusting illitch has been a controversial figure for a long time but his story is like example of the american dream you d see in fiction his parents were poor immigrants  he grew up in detroit joined the marines played minor league baseball for the team he now owns opens up a mom and pop pizza place and creates an empire out of it  gets rich while creating jobs and doing public works projects for the city he grew up in even though it s a complete shit hole mike ilitch has been spending  and yes  making  money in detroit for years mike ilitch was there in the 90 s and early 00 s before there was ever a housing crash in the rest of the country the man is nt a saint but if it were nt for him there would be a lot less charities and projects being invested in now he wants to build a project the city desperately needs with the city s help and input  and he s getting shit on by some dumb ass  journalist  that ca nt get their facts straight  endran,7,

70305,gt  detroit contractor who negotiated  285 million in public money for the red wings now works with red wings owner so  i love how these headlines are supposed to make us feel outraged,4,
70306,same shit happened here in richardson  texas  a suburb of dallas   the mayor brought in a huge company to the city and then left office to get a job with that same company it also turns out she was having an affair with a guy from that company too,3,
70307,stop giving public money let business deal with business  not government  which can only be scammed and lead to corruption and bloated monopolies promote free market  and separation of power,3,

70310,conflict of interests everywhere,1,
70311,this is how it worksthere is nt anything new to this story that is nt happening in nearly every major city and state across the country  i do nt like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it,1,
70312,public money  om,1,
70313,wow  you mean so someone who worked very closely with an organization and built relationships decided to work for said company later on in their career  shocking  i tell you,1,
70314,everyone from the owners to the safety and comfort of the city and everyone thinks this whole plan is going to a country that did not mainly speak my language  i would learn it,1,
70315,what a shocking surprise,1,
70316,well that s convenien,1,
70317,in other news  bears do  it turns out  shit in the woods,1,
70318,can we just start an embarrass the fuck out of these greedy punks campaign,1,
70321,interesting though   since 2005  texas has prosecuted 38 juveniles for intoxication manslaughter or intoxication assault only three were sent to the adult system  and half of all cases resulted in probation of some kind  i think this is more telling of the justice system  and accessibility to competent  quality counsel it s clear money buys better legal counsel  but if the government subsidized public defense more heavily  the outcomes would clearly be different,9,
70322,cash is king in the world of corruption,9,
70323,i said this somwhere else  but it s also pertinent here  everyone is equal under the law and money is how we measure that equality,9,
70324,the difference  money,9,
70325,it s almost like the rich live under different rules,8,
70326,this is standard practice in the us judicial system outcomes will vary from case to case depending on financial status there s actually a legal term for it  it s called   cream ,9,
70327,my mom has always said guilty until proven rich,8,
70328,i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law this is the american dream,8,
70329,and liberty and justice for all  who can afford it ,5,
70330,i love how this article just glosses over the fact that arellano had previous dui convictions which is why he did nt receive the same sentence  this was couch s first dui case which is why he got probation  as texas takes the rehab route  but whatever lets rage and ignore the fact,8,
70331,is everyone here honestly  seriously shocked that money gets you out of trouble  am i taking crazy pills,5,
70332,going beyond the dae legal system is corrupt  circlejerk in this thread  there are certainly some differences in these cases firstly  the arellano case  the other one in the article  happened in 2007  six years before couch s trial likewise  the article says that arellano had driven while intoxicated and drank underage before  which means that he would ve had a greater chance of being moved to an adult trial meanwhile  couch had no prior violations of the law  meaning that he could nt be moved to an adult court,6,
70333,i understand what you are trying to do with your anecdotal case comparisons however  they are nt comparable cases when you consider all the factors  including criminal history  but  even if you ignore all the other factors  i know of a white 20 yo male from a fairly wealthy family in my area who was sent to prison for a year based on a drunk driving accident so my anecdotal evidence shows similar punishment to your anecdotal case thereby anecdotally refuting your point,8,
70334,the real crime here those eyebrow,6,
70335,gee  it s almost like different judges and prosecutors in different areas with separate cases can lead to different verdicts or something,6,
70336,that s why the case became famous because he got away while guilty that was autocorrect capitalization,4,
70337,affluenza is just a fake term that means the following  if you are rich  you do nt go to jail if you are not  you will spend 10 years like 95  of americans,4,
70338,let s be clear what happened to the poor kid was what s supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone you fucking go to prison couch was the exception,7,
70339,he did nt go free he was on probation and then he violated that  so he s going to jail,8,
70340,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,3,
70341,if someone is brought up too rich to not know the difference between right and wrong  why can the same argument not be used for poor people who commit crimes  people who are brought up in poverty do nt really know right from wrong just as much as a kid who has rich parents,3,
70342,that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time,3,

70345,obviously as white god intended,4,
70346,i fucking hate ethan couch  i mean look at that look on his face disgusting i mean even his name is stupid,5,
70347,horrible headline  38 cases of dui manslaughter in texas since 2005 and only 3 of them went to adult court  that tells you the vast majority of these cases are handled with kid glovesso picking out one of 3 that went the other route and comparing it to the affluenza case is disingenuous  but fuck it  that is what the media does today god forbid they instead do an article focusing on how in texas if you are a drunk driving kid that kills people you will get away with it 35 out of 38 time,4,
70348,it did nt seem to mention how they had the same judge  we ve already established this same judge would have been open to giving a similar sentence to a poor minority because she tried to do just that keep making this a race issue  though lord knows the media loves to stir up ignorant poor folks  also  anyone who comes to the us illegally and kills is citizens deserves little sympathy he was a juvenile  so it would be appropriate to release him and deport him  i do nt understand the need to distort issues to make tbem about race we already have enough problems it s already an established fact that those with the means to afford a lawyer fair better than those who do nt,3,
70349,the difference  money,1,
70350,did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window,1,

70356,well  on one hand you have a kid that killed 3 adults and a child in a crash  and on the other a kid who killed a mother and her  unborn child  in a crash in a conservative state so he could have mowed down 10 born people and probably got less than what he gets for  accidentally  killing 1 unborn baby,1,
70357,free public defender vs 2000  an hour lawyer,1,
70358,this affluenza thing still baffles me  doing bad things because money  with that sort of logic hobos must be saints and not the crack heads living under bridges,1,
70359,no shit  i mean was nt the entire outrage that similar cases normally lead to prison in the first place,1,
70360,seriously  the rich kid,1,
70361,that s what  affluenza  means literally the entire point of this case and why it s been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich,1,
70362,i say it like my grandma used to  money talks  bullshit walks,1,
70363,he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows wtf,1,

70371,arizona   republican   legislators want to subvert the will of the people ftf,7,
70372,sounds reasonable to me  more easily  is such a loaded headline current law states ballot measures need 34th of both chambers of legislature to overturn ballot measures no matter how narrowly they pass mesnard wants to amend the law so that the amount needed to overturn is proportional to the margin the measure passed  people want to sit here and think this is some republican ploy on the grounds of marijuana measures  but what happens if some sleazy right wing john kavanagh inspired measure gets through at 51   there are certainly 15 az senators who ll support it and thus it ca nt be changed  this bill gives parity to both sides of the aisle,,
70374,cant ever trust cops you cant tell me that no one in the police dept knew this was happening they are all a bunch of child molesting bullies and there should be a reform on the police system in america  the government uses chemtrails to numb us to the police brutality that happens infront of us  every day  and soon we will be living in a facist policestate society controlled by the good ol boys club  if we dont elect jill stein this year  extend the presidential term limits and gxd bless america    edit      oops  i thought it said  sherrif man    point still stands though,,
70377,they do not care what police do with them  they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them  edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create  that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all  they do not care about you you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle,8,
70378,why this has 58 upvotes when some stupid shit about a teen  affluenza  case has 4000  i can not fathom priorities  people,7,
70379,where is the tipping point for police state,7,
70380,the stingray is just one of  many   https  theinterceptcomsurveillancecatalogue  devices used by our governmental police agencies against us,8,
70381,good ole harris  i m glad they have branched out from raking the military over the coals for their radios and now get the law enforcement agencies for the stingray,4,
70382,alex jones brought this up long ago  yet hes a kook though right,1,
70383,what is the point of all this secrecy  this stuff always comes out,1,
70385,how enforceable is this really  what do we do when we find tons of food that turns out to be from an illicit source  destroy it,6,
70386,i had no idea this was even a thin,4,
70387,good luck is nt that the entire shrimp industry,3,
70388,why was nt this a law like 80 years ago ,1,
70389,even if it s not perfect or entirely enforceable yet  it s a first and important step in doing the right thing,1,
70390,i live in a small fishing town and sometimes the price they get for their fish is equivalent to slave labor,1,
70391,all goods from slave labor,1,
70392,can we ban retail items created by slave labor too  looking at you nike,1,
70393,it s not a thing you ca nt import anything produced by slave labor,1,
70395,yes please too big to fail means they are too big  period break them apart,8,
70396,this seems like a no brainer not saying it will be easy  but why ever have banks too large to fail even exist,9,
70397,absolutely agree  but it will likely go nowhere it really is nt any different than when the government stepped in and broke up atamp  t into the baby bells unfortunately  this is talk by those who have no power to enforce change,6,
70398,seems like a good move if you re too big to fail  you are clearly in violation of antitrust and monopoly legislation  surely  plus  anything that is too big to fail is clearly just a bad idea from the standpoint of a societies ability to sustain unexpected shocks and surprises,7,
70399,big banks and wall street bank elections for both parties not going to happen unless supreme court reverses  citizens united  ruling allowing corporations to donate unlimited amount of funds to politicians and political parties as long as such bribery is legal  no politician will bite the hand that feeds himher,4,
70400,this is a political talking point floated to make sanders look like an over reactor if andor when he loses the nomination this guy and his idea will disappear from sight,5,
70401,hopefully  his floating that idea wo nt end up with him floating in the river,4,
70402,kashkari  eh  so  how does goldman sachs make money off of this,4,
70403,eh  wake me when they actually start breaking them up for now this is just more idle talk,4,
70404,i guess they could nt find a picture that makes him look crazier,4,
70405,if there are any economists here  i have a question how do we know that this wo nt have the same results as breaking up telecoms  regional monopolies collude until one is more successful and one starts to fail the successful one buys the failing one then this process repeats until the most successful one is enormous again  but with writeoffs  layoffs and debts thanks to the less successful ones consumers get screwed by footing the bill for the whole failed experiment  if telecoms can do that  why would we assume that banks wo nt just do the same thing  to the effect of even more pain for consumers,4,
70406,oh hey  it s the guy who ran for california governor,3,
70407,news update  spontaneous fires erupt in rome,3,
70408,no if we break up banks or make them have more capital  they will invest less  and folks on reddit will say its too hard to get a loan the banks will now actually want to make sure folks can actually pay back the loan  and a lot of folks have no assets  and will cry its not fair   only the rich are getting the loans    since they already have assets   are you sure you want to hold banks accountable  personally  i think its a great idea  but not sure you all realize the banks will just push that accountability back on you,3,
70409,that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money,1,
70410,probably not that big of a problem anymore they ve plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 20 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become,1,
70411,looks as though he s beginning a political career as a goldman  fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him asshole,1,
70412,breaking up huge banks reduces the chance that banks will get the giant bailouts the did after 2008 failures  massive corporate welfare they will lobby hard against the potential loss of a free ride,1,
70413,godless commie socialism yes pleas,1,
70414, flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca nt fail  did anyone else see this   wtf  so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further,1,
70415,trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it,1,
70416,from my armchair  i d say that the entire banking sector needs to be deleveraged 301 leverage  or whatever it currently is  is too much slowly  over time  to prevent shocks from the deleveraging   deleverage the banks  and it would make it harder for a crisis to become systemic,1,
70417,kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying,1,
70418,kashkari was part of the paulson team that leveraged the american banking empire into toobigtofail and now that that leverage is proving to be dangerous for the survival of the one per cent kleptocrats he wants to break up the tbtf banks  geithner knew this would manifest when he used tbtf as a stopgap measure to save the synagogue of satan worshiping kleptocracy of fraudsters that run the federal reserve now that same kleptocracy wants to be bailed out once again because geithner s temporary solution has run it s course straight into the gutter where geithner amp  kashkari et al  belong  up yours  america the functional retard,,
70420,bison burgers bison steaks bison roasts  yum,8,
70421,the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison,5,
70422,are they only being killed for food  that s slaughter  if they are being killed for management purposes  that s called culling,7,
70423,it s population control  hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use,6,
70424,cancan i help,4,
70425,npr text article and radio discussion if anyone is interested  http  mtprorgpostofficialsagreecullmany900yellowstonebison  stream,1,

70431,give the castros their money and let them build paper towns while the real population continues to suffer,,

70433,cuba is going on the vacation list i bet there s a ton of secluded beaches that have nt been trashed yet by countless tourists,,
70435,the government issued 15 billion euros of sixyear notes to yield 198 percent  gt  and 1 billion euros of 15year bonds with a 342 percent yield  the finance ministry said in an emailed statement,3,
70436,anyone else surprised at the extremely low interest rates for mexican bonds  i would of thought that their borrowing costs was more in line with other developing countries,1,
70438,i lived 200yds from a burn pit when i was there in 04 i had some skin disease for about 2 years after iraq and some kind of asthma the va did nt give a shit then and they still do nt care  so  i got that goin for me,9,
70439,i was in tikrit  cob speicher  from 08 to 09 i lived a few hundred feet from the  burn pit  it was basically a huge junk yard with 3 huge constantly burning rectangular pits they were about 75 feet long and 50 feet across iirc you could see black or white smoke billowing from the area all the time i had to go there at least once a week to dump trash imagine standing over a red hot fire throwing junk off the back of a flatbed truck while it was 130 degrees outside sometimes the smog was so thick driving through the junk yard  that you could nt see 50 feet in front of you the smoke would almost always linger around the base and it smelled awful olfactory fatigue did not apply here it always smelled no matter how long you d be  exposed  you never got used to it never mind that they burned our shit right next door i remember one day we had to do a pt test the 2 mile run was on the same road as the burn pit smoke everywhere nobody passed that day some people were puking at the end i usually ran a 13  45 2 mile and i remember getting over 17 minutes i was gasping for air at the end we all thought the course was marked out incorrectly  but when we measured it later that day it was exactly 2 miles needless to say  nobody ever had any respiratory protection around these things  ever nor were we ever told we needed them i mean we had our gas masks in our gear  but nobody wanted to be  that guy  damn  we used to joke about it all the time whenever someone would start spewing some  war story   or when some freshoutabasic private would try to tell us about  that one time my drill sergeant made us do this  story   at the end we d say   yeah  but have you ever been to the burn pit    then we d laugh it off i guess it s not so funny anymore,8,
70440,my husband  half  jokes about the cancer he s going to get from the burn pits in afghanistan from what he described  they were horrible,7,
70441,this hits close to home we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight i really need to get this checked out,7,
70442,i can understand why burning trash and human waste may be unavoidable in certain military circumstances like in those remote outposts in afghanistan that might house 1520 people  there really are nt any good alternatives  however it seems less defensible to not have invested in better infrastructure once you had permanent bases the size of small cities  once you re at the point where soldiers had their own little airconditioned houses made out of cargo containers with air conditioning  satellite television  and onbase burger king it seems like you can probably invest in some proper trash incinerators instead of open burn pits,7,
70443,gt  though the us government disputes it well  color me surprised,8,
70444,a tsgt i know died recently from cancer he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family he was 32 his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer,7,
70445, support our troops with a ribbon sticker   that will definitely make up for all the fucked up shit the government puts them through,7,
70446,not surprised saw a guy in the va who used to jog through the base with his unitteam  not sure of the terminology   breathing in the smoke from one of these every day for 4 years he had some chronic lung condition we were working up  and said a couple of his buddies also have lung problems now otherwise perfectly healthy 40 years old  completely unnecessary illness due to stupidity andor apathy,6,
70447,http  wwwpublichealthvagovexposurescamplejeune for decades  the government knowingly allowed service members and their dependents to consume contaminated tap water fifteen diseases are recognized to have a direct relation to the contamination but many more are cropping up yet the government wo nt recognize those  yet   and they re filing motions to have claims tossed out based on statute of limitations  even though the government did nt even announce the contamination until over a decade after the wells were closed  this is nt just an agent orange or iraq war contamination where soldiers were exposed and have problems babies born at the base hospital hadhave an alarmingly high rate of birth defects but nothing is being done about it and the va continues to deny claims we ll just go ahead and add this one to the list,6,
70448,uhh i ve had a severe cough for 34 years now  since coming back from afghanistan  it ll get so bad  that i ll cough until i throw up  and then cough more  the va said it was normal i m sure they know what they re talking about i feel fine,6,
70449,i remember having to sit through a 2 hour briefing the first week i arrived in iraq  back in 2008 we were told that scientists verified that the burn pit on base was not a detriment to our health  then we had to sign forms when i returned stateside  there were quite a few reports of people having respiratory issues after returning from deployment  the va also denied that any illnesses were related to desert storm it took a long time for anyone other than veterans to admit that desert storm syndrome was a real thing  and then said veterans had to go through the gauntlet of proving their illnesses were related to their deployment,7,
70450,goddamn  it s unbelievable the way vets are treated shame,6,
70451,government does nt give a fuck about veterans,5,
70452,my 36yo buddy was just diagnosed with nonhodgkens lymphoma when he visited the va to do the paperwork they asked what bases he served at overseas  and literally had a list of diseases to reference per base just got a  yep  here it is probably from the burn pit  from the clerk thumbing down the list when he told me i was blown away  why is nt there any followup with soldiers who served at these bases    even a simple  you may want to get screened  when he returned from service would have given us some hope of getting in front of it it s incredibly irritating,5,
70453,the us lying about iraq and afghanistan  nah  never happen,7,
70454,do nt worry guys we ll take care of your medical needs when you come home oh wait,5,
70455,do nt forget area 51 they had burn pits like you would nt believe stealth materiels that had top secret components in them the poor guys that were exposed to all of this could nt even go for help  many died in secrecy  i know i was exposed to vaporized depleted uranium and who knows what else i have a sort of bet with my self that i ll die an early death,5,
70456,so  the dod did nt learn any lessons from previous burn pits  i mean  when you have to declassify area 51 because of workers health decline due to burn pits  you d think you d remember this shit is wrong,5,
70457, though he returned home safely in september 2009  he woke up one day a few months later with an inexplicable headache  numbness in his limbs and paralysis on one side of his body beau had suffered a mild stroke his health deteriorated  and he was diagnosed with brain cancer less than two years later  he died at the age of 46  holy fuck    fuck wars and politicians that start them,4,
70458,the us govt so cares about its troops,7,

70460,does kaf still have the shit pond  on another note  im going to have this checked out the va has this on their website somewhere  they sent an email,4,
70461,there are so many things wrong with this i do nt even know what to say  let s just purposefully burn hazardous material  petroleum products  chemicals  and batteries next to our camp oh  and throw some explosives in there while you re at it and vaporizes all that shit so we can breath it in are you kidding me,4,
70462,holy shit  my friend who was on the poop burning detail a bunch of times died of throat cancer earlier this year my first thought was it was the poop burning that did it  and i m concerned as well because i did my fair share of that as well,4,
70463,where we lived there was a burn pit that was nearby and the smoke would always float over to where we were  as of yet i dont have any symptoms but i do have a begine growth in my head  i have had it checked but i am paranoid that it could become bad ,4,
70464,little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did nt have to bother to actually lob chemicalbio weapons at us we d send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chembio bomb themselves  did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney,4,
70465,every time i allow myself a shred of regret for not enlisting  i remind myself that this kind of shit is what the us does to its soldiers fuck that i respect your service and all that  but fuck that shit,1,
70466,every goddamn war the military has to do something that exposes troops to dangerous chemicals,3,
70467,makes me wonder  i was at camp addertallil back in 2010  2011  what was i exposed to,3,
70468,i was in taji in 2011 2 people got cancer after our deployment  lots of people were having breathing problems we were right next to the tank graveyard and the burn pit was constantly going in our rush to shut down theater i ve gotten lung infections every year since then,3,

70541,gt  bundy   his  attorney said  would go to court in nevada if ordered to do so   right  sure i mean  it s not like he s ever defied the government before  and he  totally  recognises it s legitimacy  gt  but judge stewart said if bundy was released   i  m guessing that  s the last we  ll ever see of mr bundy  a wise and perspicacious judge,9,
70542, daughterinlaw briana bundy said tuesday that a federal judge in oregon should let the 69yearold live at home while he awaits trial  sure that s an excellent suggestion i would further suggest that the judge prepare a lunch of peanut butter sandwiches with home made raspberry jam and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies for mr bundy each day,8,
70543,gt  the judge said bundy  69  is a flight risk and a danger to the community in the bail hearing tuesday afternoon in downtown portland i mean i ca nt really find a reason not to agree with that a 69 year old who does nt believe he s beholden to the law is as dangerous as a 29 year old who does nt believe he s beholden to the law,8,
70544,they are just misunderstood they did this for free sex toys,7,
70545,not sure he was the worst member of ya llquaida  http  mwashingtontimescomnews2014apr15formersheriffwillingletwifedaughterdiefron,6,

70547,the man is a wellmeaning but ideologically obsessed idiot the government has handled this clusterfuck extremely well  and i am not one to say that lightly,6,
70548,it s important for the government to provide a consistent and cohesive narrative if they are to help squash future acts of rebellion cliven bundy and his ilk are lawless  violent  redneck anarchists and none of the things they protested had any validity whatsoever,5,
70549,good  this arrest and trial has been delayed for too long,7,
70550,given his history  bundy is as dangerous as a monkey with a straightrazor,4,
70551,where is the groundswell of the righteously indignant right wing militia that was supposed to come to his aid,1,
70552,mmmmmm i need some of the bundy range fed beef i hope the feds seize it all soon and put it up for sale,1,

70577,inb4 this thread gets nuked by the mods,9,
70578,not only did they assault a veteran with a deadly weapon  they used his credit cards at locations should nt be too tough to find them fuck these kids,8,
70579,this is a pretty typical mugging the mugger aggressively asks you a question  and regardless of your answer they either beat you or ask for money sometimes it s shit like  do you care about the homeless   and if you say  yes  then they aggressively ask for money and if you say no they get upset and threaten you and say you are a liar if you say no  they threaten to beat you or they just get violent either way  you are going to end up giving them your walletmoney another common one is asking you for a cigarette if you do nt have any  they will accuse you of having one and not giving it to them because of some stupid reason  racism  greed  etc  and then get aggressive and demand money for a pack of cigarettes whenif you pull out your wallet they will just grab it and walk away or beat you and run  i was on a bus and had a guy ask for my cell phone to make a call  when i said no  he said i was a racist because i assumed he was going to steal it made a big scene and stood up and got in my face and started slapping my head until i gave him the phone then he got off the bus  same principle with this happens all the fucking time if they get caught they usually say shit like  oh he gave it to me  i did nt steal it  scumbags only reason this one made the news is because it was a war vet,9,
70580,pieces of shit who ve done nothing but take from societ,8,
70581,i hope that the assailants rot in prison,7,
70582,from the daily caller article  gt   i believe this was a hate crime and i was targeted because of my skin color   marquez told the dcnf  too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the main stream media refuses to report on it  woah there racist  only black people can be the victim of a hate crime  now take your beating and shut the hell up about these underprivileged disadvantaged teen youths,8,
70583,i m sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case,8,
70584,lock these shitheads up and throw away the ke,8,
70585,black lives do matter these teens  lives  however do not,9,
70586,every fucking time a cop shoots a black guy  justified or not  we have people like obama telling us we have to do some  soul searching  and when cities like dc and baltimore  i live around both and can personally attest that shit like this happens all the time and is usually never reported  and detroit and new york and such have this shit happen  it s a non issue  fuck all of it  trump 201,8,
70587,do white lives matter to blacks,5,
70588,i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold  it s really political blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims  and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws  and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm  how much power do the sjws really have  will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution,8,
70589,and people try to tell me that what celebrities do and say is not important at all on some level  in some instances it is  this is the movement beyonc  tried to shove into everyone s face at the superbowl just remember that,8,
70590,best optionavoid dc because it s a shit hole,7,
70591, across the street from the fbi headquarters,7,
70592, do black lives matter if you do nt agree we ll beat and rob you   and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement,8,
70593,i would like to remind everyone that bernie sanders has aligned himself with and defended the black lives matter movement in many of his speeches he talks about sandra bland  michael brown  eric garner and in typical fashion blames racism and the white establishment sanders never once mentions the blacks that are home invading in indianapolis  kansas city  atlanta  etc he never once talks about the blacks that have shot at and killed police  most recently a 19 year old black man shoots an officer in mississippi black lives matter and politicians like sanders are waging that the future will be less white and in that future you folks can imagine who will be the most vile and racist  edit  from today  white house tweets shoutout to grammy winner of best rap album  still no word on recent spate of cop killing,9,
70594,let s see if this gets labeled as the hate crime it very clearly is  who am i kidding  that wo nt happen,8,
70595,i do not think that black lives matter more than anyone elses if anyone else does  they do nt understand what equality is fuck blm,8,
70596,i need to start carrying my gun more often i have my ccw  but rarely do i carry because i dont see the need i just acquired it because its my right to have one,7,
70597,what s weird this is nt a bad part of dc at all given  any mcdonald s you go to in this city is likely to be crawling with some of the world s worst  but still,6,
70598,yeah beating a man and robbing him is a surefire way to get your point across right,6,
70599,black lives matter is to racial equality what isis is to islam both these groups attract those who wish to have power over others  not to enlighten others i hold both in low esteem,7,
70600,the sooner they get recognized as the terrorists that they are  the sooner they can be dealt with with boots in their necks,8,
70601,do black lives matter or do all lives matter,8,
70602,black lives matter  to who,8,
70605,i m going to assume that the project is getting a lot of input from people who were ignored for the last couple years andor late additions from people who just walked in the door  typical design by committee bullshit that happen,3,
70606,put the team behind the bay bridge project in charge it will become a guaranteed success   hopefully the s wo nt be necessary,1,
70607,oh  cboss  communication based overlay signaling system  ptc  positive train control   yea  i personally worked on this project it was not a fun place to work i quit after a year,1,
70608,ah the browndogle wasting tax payers money for years to come,,
70610,i hope they left quietly after looking in the window  they might enjoy this over at rwalkingdea,4,
70611,pfft  what  really  happened was that the onduty cops did nt have cable at their station so they watched it through the windows,4,
70612,we also fire up the surround sound amp when the walking dead comes on  but we do nt keep any windows open i wonder if the propane bomb scene is what triggered the 911 cal,4,
70613, a show about firearms  more like a show about a group of survivors of a zombie apocalypse but whatever,4,
70614, it was the tee vee  i m sorry it disturrrbed you now it s rather late   nurse diese,1,

70616,damn i like me some wood in my mouth,1,
70618,gt  purchase orders showing that the sheriff s office spent more than  60000 on barbecue grills wtf why,9,
70619,this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties the docs and comments on the forum board are searing i would imagine many itinformation systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments,8,
70620,i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever,8,
70621,cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification  one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry,5,
70622,they re public officials and public servants  appointedhiredelected we re entitled to see what these records are  without exception,8,
70623,as much as i m for police transparency  i m not for their home addresses being out there that puts their families and neighbors at risk,8,
70624,i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered,8,
70625,anything worth even looking at in this release,3,
70626,do nt know why they re concerned  surely they have nothing to hide ,5,
70627,if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear,1,
70628,good anytime somebody s falsely charged with shit their life is dragged through the mud in the papers  let the pigs have the same,,
70629,you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings,1,
70630,notice that hackers never dox the 01   billionaires sponsoring hillary clinton  etc,1,
70631,you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced  well fuck it no more police and no more rules    fucking stupid juveniles,,
70632,umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops there s hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops,,
70635, they also no longer allow reporters in our senate   http  pilotonlinecomnewsgovernmentvirginiasenaterepublicansremovepressfromvirginiasenatefloorarticle_65025825eb3d5b94b879bcb294be015ehtml  senate majority leader tommy norment  r  has been trying to destroy any transparency within our government ever since his friend  exgovernor bob mcdonnell has been found guilty for federal corruption,7,
70636,next they can move them all into an exclusive  walled community nothing promotes peace and harmony like secret police,8,
70637,actual bill if you want to read it  gt  virginia freedom of information act  mandatory disclosure of public employee position and salary information  exceptions provides that the provisions of foia do not require public access to records of the names  positions  job classifications  or other personal identifying information concerning  i  employees of state or local police departments or sheriff s offices who are responsible for the prevention and detection of crime and the enforcement of the penal  traffic  or highway laws of the commonwealth   ii  special agents of the department of alcoholic beverage control   iii  officers of the virginia marine police   iv  conservation police officers who are fulltime sworn members of the enforcement division of the department of game and inland fisheries   v  investigators who are fulltime sworn members of the security division of the virginia lottery   vi  conservation officers of the department of conservation and recreation commissioned pursuant to  101115   vii  fulltime sworn members of the enforcement division of the department of motor vehicles appointed pursuant to  462217  or  viii  animal protection police officers employed under  152632 link  https  lisvirginiagovcgibinlegp604exe  ses  161amp  typ  bilamp  val  sb552 in my opinion its a step in the wrong direction secret police never really work in real world settings  for those who do nt know what actual secret police are here s a quick history excerpt from russia s secret police force  https  wwwlocgovexhibitsarchivessecrhtm,8,
70638,why cant everyone choose this option equally  badges dont grant extra right,5,
70639,times are changing police are killing people at record paces and are themselves safer than they have been since 1900 so clearly they need more protection  right,5,
70640,law ruled unconstitutional in 3 2,6,
70641,public servants my ass,3,
70642,just fuck the east coast,1,
70643, challenge accepted  sincerely  hackers,1,
70644,it s an undesirable response to an undesirable reality that copkilling is getting it s own category as a hate crime,,
70647,yes please too big to fail means they are too big  period break them apart,8,
70648,this seems like a no brainer not saying it will be easy  but why ever have banks too large to fail even exist,9,
70649,absolutely agree  but it will likely go nowhere it really is nt any different than when the government stepped in and broke up atamp  t into the baby bells unfortunately  this is talk by those who have no power to enforce change,6,
70650,seems like a good move if you re too big to fail  you are clearly in violation of antitrust and monopoly legislation  surely  plus  anything that is too big to fail is clearly just a bad idea from the standpoint of a societies ability to sustain unexpected shocks and surprises,7,
70651,big banks and wall street bank elections for both parties not going to happen unless supreme court reverses  citizens united  ruling allowing corporations to donate unlimited amount of funds to politicians and political parties as long as such bribery is legal  no politician will bite the hand that feeds himher,4,
70652,this is a political talking point floated to make sanders look like an over reactor if andor when he loses the nomination this guy and his idea will disappear from sight,5,
70653,hopefully  his floating that idea wo nt end up with him floating in the river,4,
70654,kashkari  eh  so  how does goldman sachs make money off of this,4,
70655,eh  wake me when they actually start breaking them up for now this is just more idle talk,4,
70656,i guess they could nt find a picture that makes him look crazier,4,
70657,if there are any economists here  i have a question how do we know that this wo nt have the same results as breaking up telecoms  regional monopolies collude until one is more successful and one starts to fail the successful one buys the failing one then this process repeats until the most successful one is enormous again  but with writeoffs  layoffs and debts thanks to the less successful ones consumers get screwed by footing the bill for the whole failed experiment  if telecoms can do that  why would we assume that banks wo nt just do the same thing  to the effect of even more pain for consumers,4,
70658,oh hey  it s the guy who ran for california governor,3,
70659,news update  spontaneous fires erupt in rome,3,
70660,no if we break up banks or make them have more capital  they will invest less  and folks on reddit will say its too hard to get a loan the banks will now actually want to make sure folks can actually pay back the loan  and a lot of folks have no assets  and will cry its not fair   only the rich are getting the loans    since they already have assets   are you sure you want to hold banks accountable  personally  i think its a great idea  but not sure you all realize the banks will just push that accountability back on you,3,
70661,that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money,1,
70662,probably not that big of a problem anymore they ve plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 20 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become,1,
70663,looks as though he s beginning a political career as a goldman  fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him asshole,1,
70664,breaking up huge banks reduces the chance that banks will get the giant bailouts the did after 2008 failures  massive corporate welfare they will lobby hard against the potential loss of a free ride,1,
70665,godless commie socialism yes pleas,1,
70666, flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca nt fail  did anyone else see this   wtf  so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further,1,
70667,trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it,1,
70668,from my armchair  i d say that the entire banking sector needs to be deleveraged 301 leverage  or whatever it currently is  is too much slowly  over time  to prevent shocks from the deleveraging   deleverage the banks  and it would make it harder for a crisis to become systemic,1,
70669,kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying,1,
70670,kashkari was part of the paulson team that leveraged the american banking empire into toobigtofail and now that that leverage is proving to be dangerous for the survival of the one per cent kleptocrats he wants to break up the tbtf banks  geithner knew this would manifest when he used tbtf as a stopgap measure to save the synagogue of satan worshiping kleptocracy of fraudsters that run the federal reserve now that same kleptocracy wants to be bailed out once again because geithner s temporary solution has run it s course straight into the gutter where geithner amp  kashkari et al  belong  up yours  america the functional retard,,
70672,has nt he already had  like  two years to prevent this in the first place,7,
70673,lansing has actually dealt with this problem and their civil engineers have a solution which is both fast and more costeffective than traditional measures they connect the end of the new pipe to the old pipes so when they pull out the old pipe they simultaneously thread the new pipes into the existing space this speeds up the process and the people in lansing estimate with adequate training  involving them with the process in flint  and hiring enough crews it can be completed for flint in one year,7,
70674,this whole situation is a national embarrassment  and it makes my blood boil  but what does naacp have to do with city water  is it a race issue as well  i ve never seen the demographics on flint  come to think of it  maybe aspca should get involved  too i bet people are still feeding their pets city water no matter what  edit  i just think it should be about officials   doing their fucking jobs    framing it as a race issue might just come back to bite us  who knows how many towns are discreetly checking for  and finding  elevated lead  should it matter how many african americans live there  if so  how should officials proceed differently  will it result in a process of public relations triage  that prioritizes black communities  public officials just need to do their fucking jobs for the public they serve there s no need to complicate this with race,5,
70675,that s like threatening to get one of those online white house petitions going it does nt matter,1,
70676,fix flint s water pipes or they ll burn flint to the ground,3,
70677,i m all for getting this fixed as quickly as possible but i also do nt want something rushed either figure it out figure it out right,1,
70678,okayand then what  all of the protesting has nt done jack so far what s one more protest going to do  it s not going to make the state government move any faster  it s very clear that the government  at every level  is more concerned about covering itself a protest is nt going to change that,,
70679,sooooo glad i do nt live in flint  that place sounds like a complete disaster,,
70680,who the fuck are they to demand this  are whiteasianlatino people not allowed to be affected by this,,
70682,how screwed up would you have to be,1,
70683,i do nt understand how this happens in a state with safe surrender laws,1,
70685,not really news unless you do nt remember the stuxnet incident from a few years ago  http  wwwbusinessinsidercomstuxnetwasfarmoredangerousthanpreviousthought201311  stuxnet  a usisraeli project,7,
70686,hell of a lot better plan than bombing the facilities in iran good guy government,4,
70687,so they are calling it a success,4,
70688,if only they used that cyber attack on shitbag israel instead lahymen,,
70691,well  that ought to take care of the problem,1,
70692,i like that guy after all  i would only do it for the money with minimal violence  and would never want to kill people so  if i ever decide to go and work for a cartel  i m  definitely  working for el jesus,1,
70693,is he hiring mercenaries  or he has enough already  it s also not a problem to join any military  as they re all doing god s work,1,
70694,well  if their since could nt be instantly forgiven  that might have had weight,1,
70695,clearly  jesus would prefer that you support the child rape industrial complex because that s how he rolls,1,
70696,jesus the auto repairman,1,
70698,so not only are these disputed  there are now long term  long range weapons on them,1,
70700,at least the guy was honest,4,
70701,i would nt be mad if it was my wallet,1,
70702,how do they know the guy was homeless,1,
70704,meanwhile  the cat yawned and continued to wash its face,6,
70705,could nt find it in the article  but wonder the breed of the dog not that it matters kudos to dogs ,1,
70707,how do i get one of these fuck around on the internet jobs,9,
70708,because twitter has been such a phenomenal business succes,9,
70709,gt  luckie  s new role will entail working with media organizations  as well as government organizations  to understand how they  re currently using reddit and what their needs are from the platform  luckie told me he  ll then take that feedback and build it into reddit  s product  with the goal of making reddit more accessible to a broader community of people  so reddit will listen to what they like and dislike and then hand feed us whaat they want us to hear no longer will it be us posting what we find interesting and up or down voting it for exposure as much as it is meant to be  that s what i am hearing just another nail,9,
70710,gt  the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do nt we have that subreddit already ,8,
70711,will this have an impact on integrity within certain front page  news related  and default subs concerning submissionsdeletionsetc,6,
70712,so more sponsored posts too bad voatco is such a shitty alternative,8,
70713,the entire article talks about his race  reddit  you are a disappointing piece of shit,7,
70714,i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites,7,
70715,so is his job to come around and censor our posts,7,
70716,great  now reddit is stealing other people s diversity hires  jesus  there really is just no oc on this site anymore  is there,7,
70717,just as a precaution  i think we all should be putting on our life jackets,6,
70718,does this dude give off  profitability  pixie dust when he walks around the office  what is causing all of these companies  reddit  yahoo  twitter  vox  salon  mashable  github  gawker  etc  in decline to try and make up for shitty business practices with diversity hires  it does nt matter how many black activist and feminists you hire  that wont solve a lack of profitability and coming from a company that tanked  and you were suppose to be part of the solution  is nt exactly a gold star on your resume you are suppose to jump ship from companies that are failing not get on board,7,
70719,aka manipulator in chief,6,
70720,so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming and this was the great marketing that is killing them,5,
70721,that seems like quite a comedown  with all due respect to this fine institution,3,
70722,let s see what shitty changes they come up with 144 character limit  perhaps,4,
70723,it s about ethics in reddi,3,
70724,just read about how twitter is filtering political content of a particular kind good news for reddit  they re on their way to being another propaganda wing of the left,1,
70725,great  a news manager  amp  head of journalism  with the attention span of one sentence  and the intellectual depth of a drunk on a 24 hour train ride  note  reddit is a whore for anything that emanates out of the roman catholic ponzi generating pope s pie hole perhaps the new head of journalism  could find another criminal organization to support on reddit instead of the catholic church criminal empire,,
70728,it s time to play rnews or rjokes,5,
70729,in his defense though  no dough  no cookies monster s got to eat yo,1,
70730,and darth vader amp  freddie kruger were left free  where s the justice ,1,
70732,i hope they left quietly after looking in the window  they might enjoy this over at rwalkingdea,4,
70733,pfft  what  really  happened was that the onduty cops did nt have cable at their station so they watched it through the windows,4,
70734,we also fire up the surround sound amp when the walking dead comes on  but we do nt keep any windows open i wonder if the propane bomb scene is what triggered the 911 cal,4,
70735, a show about firearms  more like a show about a group of survivors of a zombie apocalypse but whatever,4,
70736, it was the tee vee  i m sorry it disturrrbed you now it s rather late   nurse diese,1,
70737,is nt it heartwarming how tv can still bring the whole family together,1,
70739,thats bad news for all the 711 in our town that take the,8,
70740,does nt this just translate into fewer places for poor people to buy food,7,
70741, 711 cashiers will now have to ring up cigarettes as organic kale instead of hot pockets,7,
70742,on the other hand  if the business stops taking food stamps entirely  not only can they not get the kale you want to make them eat  but they also ca nt get a loaf of bread or gallon of milk unless they start selling their food stamps to get cash to buy the milk and bread so the business still makes their money  the amount of food stamp fraud goes up  and the poor that you claim to be helping are getting even less food  healthy or otherwise  because of the food stampcash exchange rate,5,
70743,why are nt food stamps like wic  with wic you get vouchers for specific food items these items cover the basic food groups and align with a certain amount of nutritional value  meanwhile  you can buy friggin monster energy drinks with food stamps that makes no sense  regardless if you are looking at it from a healthy standpoint or a taxpayer standpoint,6,
70744,if obesity and other nutrition related issues are such a problem among the poor  would nt it be more cost effective to do away with food stamps and implement something like a food box program instead  in other words would the cost of labor to package and ship prepared food boxes in bulk to grocery stores and distribution centers be offset by what would be saved in reduced healthcare costs  imagine a program where you list the people in your household  any allergies or specific requirements and a box is prepared to supplement your family for a week it could contain things like rice  beans  canned or pouched goods like meats  vegetables and fruits  dried oatmeal and cereals  powdered milk  cooking oil every month they could receive a selection of 5 spices  salt and pepper and even a recipe pamphlet if in addition to the box  they started a program where grocery stores and produce growers could drop off older or bruised produce  people could pick some up for free when they picked up their boxes,7,
70745,what if the healthy foods do nt sell  are they still forced to stock them  would nt you think the actual grocers in the neighborhood would have a better sense of what their customers want than the federal government,4,
70746,no they ll stop or pack up and leave  ahhhincentives,4,
70747,you can lead them to water  but you ca nt make them drin,5,
70748,we have jackinthebox here in phoenix that has we accept ebt  signs up all over pisses me off  same thing at the gas station when you see children without any parents around loading up on overpriced candy and soda and  sure enough  out comes the ebt card or even worse is when they are  with  the adult and loading up on dog shit  food stamps should only be foractual food,3,
70749,honestly this will be great  the state  should  be very involved in what people eat for free,1,
70750,another  good intention  bad policy,1,
70751,this is the dark side of welfare  the constitution is completely circumvented the government has the power to cajole and pressure when it is putting stipulations on the money it gave out the government is capable of doing things it would never have the power of doing otherwise  like forcing a business to carry certain products  or forcing a person to apply for jobs or eventually  forcing people to work at government labor jobs,,
70752,because dontravious demands fresh cilantro,1,
70753,i wonder how much crime in a store would go down if the store was no longer food stamp approved,1,
70755,i was happier before i knew this subculture existed,9,
70756,so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10 that does nt make much sense,9,
70757,how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killedhow from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human,9,
70758,one of these videos was sent to me many years ago  forwarded on a myspace page  yeah  many  years ago   they were trying to  raise awareness  when they sent it to me to help the people get caught  but all they really ended up doing was spreading that ghastly thing to more points of the internet i wo nt describe a single second of it  but suffice it to say that it s horrifying i ve never been able to remove the memory i ve been through a lot in my military career  and yet seeing a 2minute version of one of those videos was easily the most horrible thing i have ever witnessed,9,
70759,gt  brent justice  54  was convicted and sentenced monday for cruelty to nonlivestock animals  i guess justice has been served,9,
70760,i ca nt imagine the mentality of the person making it or watching it and people get off on it    who the hell sees a cat being stabbed in the eye and thinks  hey  time to get the jergens  ,9,
70761,no complaints from me but i ve noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago,9,
70762,for once  reading a story of horrifying animal abuse does nt fill me with rage this must be what justice feels like finally  an appropriate sentence so sick of people like these getting slaps on the wrist due to inadequate animal protection laws,9,
70763,i read the title then thought  hhmmm what s an animal crush video   who would have thunk it  animal crush videos are videos of animals getting crushed there goes some of the little remaining faith i had in humanit,9,
70764,psa  if for some reason you come here first  and you do nt know what crush videos are  please do nt look them up,8,
70765,i m not saying this is nt some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder,9,
70766,who the fuck beats off to animals being killed  what the fuc,7,
70767,i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens wtfi just dont understan,8,
70768,houston man is trying to compete with florida man  and this is definitely an act i hope florida man does nt try to top,8,
70769,there are some very fucked up people in this world to me  it is inconceivable how someone does this,8,
70770,only 10 minutes in  and i ve already had enough reddit for today,6,
70771,gt  investigators said justice filmed a scantily clad richards  sometimes masked  stabbing animals  including a puppy  a kitten and a chicken  as well as chopping off their limbs and urinating on them while making sexual comments to the camera  what the actual fuck,6,
70772,you know when you really  really wish you had nt read the article linked to  this is one of those times right now,7,
70773,you can kill your spouse  drunk drive and kill 4 people  steal millions of dollars from the american people  or molest dozens of children in a church of a period of 30 years and literally get less jail time when we say we love our doggos  and kittys   we fucking mean it,6,
70774,i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective it was the first exposure i d ever had to this subculture  crush fetish   after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals  their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse that s all i have to say about that,1,
70776,as someone who just for the first time heard the term animal crush videos  i wash that i had nt something is seriously wrong with you if this is what gets you off,7,
70777,well that just ruined my da,6,
70778,i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed ,4,
70779,fuck people are fucked,5,
70780,if slaughter houses had glass walls  everyone would quit eating animals the cognitive dissonance in here is incredible,5,
70781,i definitely think this guy should be punished and i m glad he was punished  but it blow my mind how a guy like this can get 50 years and a pedophile or rapist can get 1020 or less,5,
70782,i do nt understand how the sicko who did the maiming and killing gets 10 years  but the man who filmed it gets 50 that woman should not see light ever again,1,
70786,i ve never heard of court on a saturday thats pretty crazy,9,
70787,the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though,9,
70788,it should be interesting to see how she s ruled in cases of dui in the past,9,
70789,she refused a breathalyzer meh she ll beat thi,9,
70790,would nt being drunk compromise her ability to judge  how many times has she been impaired while working  should nt anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least  what should i make for dinner,9,
70791,offitherrrr i am the la,9,
70792,no one has mentioned this yet but she got pulled over at 8 am drinking in the morning  this judge has some problems,9,
70793,rochesterian here the article failed to mention that she was also driving with 2 flat tires for who knows how long,8,
70794,in fairness  if i was a judge in rochester i d need a few drinks before work too,9,
70795,i drove through rochester today  has anyone ever heard of a garbage plate,9,
70796,new york has pretty harsh dui laws if my memory serves me correctl,8,
70797, it s fucking vodka maaaaaaaaaan    https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  r5h6ie_hd_g,8,
70798,that would suck to have your case decided by a slurring women,9,
70799,if i know new york this should be a nasty slap on this wrist especially for those in powerful position,7,
70800,what seems to be the officer  problem,6,
70801,well who s gon na judge the case now,5,
70802,her judgement was impaire,6,
70803,fry needs to weigh in here  http  imgurcomgvji0u,6,
70804,to be clear  the fact that she refused a breathalyzer is important in many states it is treated as evidence of impairment and justification for arrest she knew that i have many friends who are criminal defense attorneys and all have told me they advise to refuse breathalyzer always  unless there is a court order  i m not familiar with ny law  but i can pretty much guarantee she will not be convicted of dui if middle classcollege kids can get out of them  a federal judge surely can since it said nothing about a field sobriety test  i assume they either did nt administer one  or they did and she did not meet criteria for impairment,5,
70805,my friends mom is a judge and that lady boozes super hard and will drive her car around i have seen her come home from the bar completely in ruins at least a dozen times over the last 10 years she is fearless  we live in a small town in wisconsin with a huge police presence she knows all the officers and has never had an issue the whole situation seems completely ridiculous she gives out sentences for dui all day and then drives drunk all night oh god  the hypocrisy,5,
70806,ny state troopers only care about the star program more tixarrest  promotionmoney so if they could get points on there own mother they would,5,
70807,i m just amazed that our local news channel in lafayette is on the front page of reddit x,5,
70808,regardless of judge plates  why shouldare judges treated any differently  if i expect to get pulled over and ticketed for 5mph over i believe a judge should too especially since they make 15 times the income,5,
70809,i feel like poor judgement like this should make you not a judge anymore,4,
70810,oh they decided the law applies today,5,
70811,many  if not most  political figures are serious alcoholics when you combine the constant parties and  fundraisers  that they are expected to attend with the stress of the job  a lot of them end up drinking a lot,8,
70812, spits out drink   it s fucking vodka man ,7,
70815,how do i get one of these fuck around on the internet jobs,9,
70816,because twitter has been such a phenomenal business succes,9,
70817,gt  luckie  s new role will entail working with media organizations  as well as government organizations  to understand how they  re currently using reddit and what their needs are from the platform  luckie told me he  ll then take that feedback and build it into reddit  s product  with the goal of making reddit more accessible to a broader community of people  so reddit will listen to what they like and dislike and then hand feed us whaat they want us to hear no longer will it be us posting what we find interesting and up or down voting it for exposure as much as it is meant to be  that s what i am hearing just another nail,9,
70818,gt  the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do nt we have that subreddit already ,8,
70819,will this have an impact on integrity within certain front page  news related  and default subs concerning submissionsdeletionsetc,5,
70820,so more sponsored posts too bad voatco is such a shitty alternative,8,
70821,the entire article talks about his race  reddit  you are a disappointing piece of shit,7,
70822,i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites,7,
70823,so is his job to come around and censor our posts,6,
70824,great  now reddit is stealing other people s diversity hires  jesus  there really is just no oc on this site anymore  is there,6,
70825,just as a precaution  i think we all should be putting on our life jackets,6,
70826,does this dude give off  profitability  pixie dust when he walks around the office  what is causing all of these companies  reddit  yahoo  twitter  vox  salon  mashable  github  gawker  etc  in decline to try and make up for shitty business practices with diversity hires  it does nt matter how many black activist and feminists you hire  that wont solve a lack of profitability and coming from a company that tanked  and you were suppose to be part of the solution  is nt exactly a gold star on your resume you are suppose to jump ship from companies that are failing not get on board,7,
70827,aka manipulator in chief,5,
70828,so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming and this was the great marketing that is killing them,6,
70829,that seems like quite a comedown  with all due respect to this fine institution,3,
70830,let s see what shitty changes they come up with 144 character limit  perhaps,4,
70831,it s about ethics in reddi,3,
70832,just read about how twitter is filtering political content of a particular kind good news for reddit  they re on their way to being another propaganda wing of the left,1,
70833,great  a news manager  amp  head of journalism  with the attention span of one sentence  and the intellectual depth of a drunk on a 24 hour train ride  note  reddit is a whore for anything that emanates out of the roman catholic ponzi generating pope s pie hole perhaps the new head of journalism  could find another criminal organization to support on reddit instead of the catholic church criminal empire,,
70835,at least the guy was honest,4,
70836,i would nt be mad if it was my wallet,1,
70837,how do they know the guy was homeless,1,
70839,an industry notorious for lying  cheating and illegal dumping  they ll do nothin,4,
70840,no keep turning the earths crust into swiss cheese for profit i m sure everything will be fine,1,
70841,i just think  this is our earth  our home  why are we doing this    i thought the same after reading about the abomb test it s not like we just get to build another earth  i m not just a hippie liberal douche some things are just bad ideas and a short few people making bad ideas and decisions which affect the global population negatively is scary,1,
70842,can someone eli5 me why we even need fracked oil right now when prices are projected to keep dropping,1,
70844,gt   the order is vague and because it imposes disproportionate  intrusive  and punitive measures against households and businesses with   no due process     did nt see that one coming,9,
70845,isps do nt actually want to spy on their customers like that it costs more money to put systems in place to do so and to maintain and operate those systems on top of that  it will only bring them bad press that could piss off customers  cox is basically saying  fuck you i m not taking a significant financial hit to spy on our customers so you can sue them and make money for yourself  they are doing the right thing  and the right thing also happens to be in their best business interest,9,
70846,good guy cox  not selling out their customers  they actually have super reliable internet no outages in any of my apartments so far,9,
70847,so to sum that up we do nt have to worry about any cox blocking,9,
70848,that s nice  but i m still going to run a vpn,8,
70849,all in all i ve been pretty happy with cox as an isp i ve used them in two different cities and it s always been reliable and fast i pay for 300mbps service and always get those speeds  usually higher almost no outages they re putting in 1gbs service in many of their cities right now  including mine  my biggest gripe with them is they have a soft data cap of 2 tb for my tier they do not enforce the caps at all but the fact that they exist means they are probably toying with the idea and there would be nothing to stop them from going evil since they are a monopoly like every other major isp it s like a benevolent dictatorship  http  wwwspeedtestnetmyresult5089441276 that s with a netflix stream going on in another room right now,9,
70850,this must be a new thing many a year s ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did nt even know what that was  none of us knew what that even was and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi,7,
70851,i ve been really happy with cox for an isp both personally and professionally here in okc personally  out of nowhere they bumped my at home connection from 15mbit to 100mbit and my bill  went down  30  all out of nowhere  without me saying a word internet is always up  not throttled  and they have decent support if it s needed  professionally at my job i ran in ip phone deployment with them for our main office  3 satellite offices they were there 100  of the way i have personal names and numbers to call in the event of issues outside of the scope of my support as the companies it admin  and when we ve needed someone on site to climb a pole for instance their longest response time was 45 minutes  i know this sounds like rhailcorporate but the fact is out of all the isps i ve had  comcast  qwest  charter  etc  they ve been the best that s not saying they should nt and could nt be better  but they re angels next to the others  in fact they proactively contact me at work every once and awhile to check on things which i greatly appreciate and they bring us cookies every month yes  our isp brings yes cookies no  we re not a big company 9 employees they re just nice,8,
70852,basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum,8,
70853,i used to work for cox in the field and inside cox did have a department that would monitor massive down loading and uploading but they did away with it shortly after i got there  within a year cox ca nt afford to lose customers right now so it s no surprise they are nt allowing this if they did then they would go out of business from customer loss i survived their huge layoff and realignment,5,
70854,this is nothing new from cox i have had cox internet for over 10 years and worked for them a few years ago they have always had this attitude toward it s customers the customer pays for internet access  cox provides internet access they do nt even enforce data caps  at least in oklahoma   i have received a few emails due to using so much data suggesting that i switch to a business plan to maximize my speed  but have never been charged extra or cut off due to exceeding a data cap,7,
70855,gt  last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers  what the actual fucking fuck,6,
70856,as a customer this is the first good thing i ve ever heard from cox,4,
70857,not true from my experience,3,
70858,i ve had them as an isp for several years and they re excellent i did have one month where i went over my allowed bandwidth limit  300 gb on a 50 mbps down plan   and all i got was an email saying  do nt do that again   no throttling or charges or anything on 100 mbps down plan right now and i usually get 110 at least they re great  come out to me if i m having internet trouble that s not solved by online support  etc pretty good basically  i love cox and i m very satisfied with how much i get,3,
70859,unrelated but i could nt stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox,3,
70860,i am a proud supporter of cox,3,
70861,where are all the penis jokes,3,
70862,not as nice as it sounds if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do nt catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status  eg that they do nt have any liabilityresponsibility for what people use their pipe for   most carriers are  very  vested in not being the internet police,3,
70863,i m guessing that if they had a way to monetize it and add to the bottom line  they d be very supportive,3,
70864,when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battl,5,
70865,cox is actually a familyowned business one of the major interest holders is a 96 year old woman who inherited from her father  she had been running it with her sister until her death in 2007   i happen to think they re one of the leastshady isp and cable providers out there  they also own the travel channel  which is a pretty great channel,5,
70866,i thought this was talking about jesse cox,4,
70867,i work for cox corporate in a startup tech company  and this makes me so happy  btw  they re just as decent an employer as they are an isp compan,3,
70868,cox is spying like a champ  rest assured you have to be quite innocent or high on meth to think they have nt supplied info to big brother and his little brothers  and will not in the future,3,
70869,yells loudly  i will not    whispers  if you need me too,1,
70870,on that headline alone  i thought jessie cox was asked to spy on his youtube subs  was very confused for a little bit,1,
70871,i knew he was my favorite eagl,1,
70872,well that s one bit of good news from cox now if they d stop raising my rates every few months,1,
70873,damn  i wish i had cox i have time warner and i m on my 3rd notice to stop torrenting i do nt know if they ll actually pull the plug  they re charging me out the ass already since they re the only provider in my area,1,
70874,fuck yea cox   comcast   1  co,1,
70875,cox  and to some extent time warner  are cable companies all cable companies fuck you in the ass  these two have the decency to spit on it first i at the very least get what i pay for with both of them,1,
70876,they sent me a few emails in the past  so i got a vpn i will still use it  but good on cox for not being dickbags,1,
70877,they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jone,1,
70878,i had cox for 3 years service was good  and over that 3 years  doubled my download speeds twice no extra cost upload was still garbage  but hey 10015 internet for  65 a month was still pretty killer i have 7575 fios now,1,
70879,almost every single person in my area that has gone to atamp  t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable  they have some shit with them but it s far less shit than others,1,
70880,they re my isp and even though they re the only isp in my city besides att and verizon  they ve been awesome,1,
70881,the shifting of blame to continue  going after johns and endusers has never worked,1,
70882,ho yeah  today is a good day to have cox  teehee,1,
70883,horseshit they cut off our internet because someone was downloading something like a year ago they re the best isp i ve ever used  but they absolutely do exactly what the mpaa et al want,1,
70884,between cox and cable one in both places i live  i actually like our midwest internet providers i feel bad for people getting rammed by twc and comcast we ve paid  45 for 100mbps for several years  which sounds way better than the horror stories i hear from you guys,1,
70885,cause they love internet freedom  or because it costs an extra 30 cents to have an extra indian screen data at the call center for 70 an hour,1,
70886,protected pirate plan from cox   7500month,1,
70889,that article is really light on details  does anyone know why this happened  did the guy not respond to a court summons or something along those lines  is nt a default the judgement the usual result in that situation,9,
70890,this happened in feb  2003 in minnesota as well  article   http  wwwmndailycom20030214usmarshalsarreststudentloandebtorstwincities,9,
70891,what happens if you literally ca nt pay your loans  asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11  just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job  edit  something a lot of you do nt seem to realize is that these were private loans there s no forgiveness with those,9,
70892,not really too much context given here  so it s hard to guess at the actual situation  but federal student loans  at least direct loans and the majority of those older loans passed back to fsa as they phased out the guarantee programs  do nt get sold to private collection agencies at this time maybe that part happened a while back  before current policies went into place and the collectors are taking advantage of the protections that federallyoriginated loans have  anyway  for people who are interested in learning more about how defaulted federal student loans are being collected today   check this out   https  wwwfbogovindex  s  opportunityamp  mode  formamp  id  216a8418f8e71f0c9c3475946ab100f8amp  tab  coreamp  _cview  1  they re currently in the middle of contracting new private collection agencies to service defaulted loans and you can see in the rfp documents how agencies are being scored and how that ties into account assignments  basically  for those who do nt feel like running through all of it  the big emphasis for student loan collections now is getting people through affordable rehabilitation options and into incomedriven repayment plans placements look like they re going to be based about 50  on careful regulatory compliance and borrower satisfaction surveys  which would make it extremely difficult for high pressure collections tactics to work out in the long run  none of that changes this story  just thought it was interesting in light of some of the comments i ve read that indicate people believe strongarm collection tactics for student loans will always be the norm  tldr  they re at least trying to throw a friendly paint job over the horribly broken federal student loan system these days,9,
70893,if you dont show up to court after you have been served this is what happens he has been ignoring collection attempts  he got served and ignored that too im not in favor of this man being arrested but you cant ignore court summons if you get served you have to go,9,
70894,upconwell said it best  gt  you are reading way to much into the article no one said they were violent no one said they had their guns drawn they are us marshals  they carry guns  every god damn day   gt  they probably went to his door  knocked he answered and they said  hey  we have a warrant for you for failing to appear in a federal court   he probably said  oh shit let me get some pants  gt  no violence  no guns drawn  everything was pretty standard and nonviolent  gt  plus  it should be noted that he was not arrested for failing to pay student loans  he was arrested for violating a court order,9,
70895,how do you not pay a  1500 loan after 30 friggin years,9,
70896,gt  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  this almost reads like satire,9,
70897,i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors,9,
70898,where in this article did it say  guns drawn  as most people are stating here  it says  with guns   every on duty us marshal goes through their day  with guns   someone signed a contract for a loan  and then spends almost three decades not paying it i agree that a police force should nt have been used there are financial measures that can be taken upon default of a loan rather than criminal  but i m really surprised by the circle jerk that s happening over a fox news article,9,
70899,can i get a misleading title please,8,
70900,you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day,6,
70901,lol  you guys are so gullible the guy dodged this debt and refused to engage the proper authorities for 25 years this is nt a new college graduate that missed one payment then you have the cascade of predictable posts stating  boot lickers    debtors prison  and how in 30 years this will be the watershed moment we all look back to as we are enslaved by the government this is a statement case the feds took an extreme example and made an extreme example of this putz the goal of this action is compliance and to get folks to not ignore their obligations the money spent on this will scare the other million folks that are past due to actually pick up the phone and engage them to resolve the debt no one held a gun to this guy s head to sign up for the student loans and no one was stopping him for 25 years from making a payment plan for the remaining  1500 this guy deserved it and as a tax payer this is ok by me,9,
70902,real story here dude was sued by the united state of america  he refused to appear  a default judgment was issued against him  he refused to appear for postjudgment depositions  judge issued an order directing him to appear in court  he ignored it and then the judge issued an arrest warrantincareration order and federal judges use us marshalls to enforce their orders  so he was nt arrested for having old student loans he was arrested for refusing to comply with a direct order from the judge  http  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386htm,8,
70903,that dude could not come up with  1500 in 29 years,8,
70904, a few years ago congress allowed the private sector to contract for student loan collections and so you have these private companies who are doing this  i find this scary  even though i have no student loans to pay off they dragged this dude to court and made him sign an agreement in front of their private attorney he had no attorney present  and was nt read any rights  edit  quote is from the video,9,
70905,forever grateful i graduated with minimal student loans ca nt ignore bills for 25 years though  regardless of what those payments stem from from reading through the comments here  it seems like incomebased payment option is the smartest option,6,
70906,i wish my student loan balance was  1500,6,
70907,i knew this story was light on facts turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies  source   yahoo finance   https  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386html,6,
70908,gt  our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is nt the first and wo nt be the last  this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least,8,
70909,he was nt arrested for not paying his loan  he was arrested for not showing up in court  and the marshals did nt storm his house guns blazing they had guns  with them   like every other cop in the entire country,7,
70910,if you take money and have no plans on paying it back  it s called stealing,9,
70911,right the debt collectors just bought the debt  payed the filing fees to bring the case to court  threatened the man with their now official   pay us or else  and when he did not they used their settlement to have him arrested by the marshals nope  no government officers for hire here  just good old debt collection paid and serviced through the courts,5,
70912,til that most people have no understanding how the court system works  yes  civil attorneys can issue subpoenas  yes  a court can hold you in contempt if you fail to appear yes  a potential punishment for contempt is a bench warrant for your arrest  tl  dr  you can not simply ignore subpoenas you may go to jail,5,
70913,writing and publishing articles like this is dangerous the author offered a sensationalist angle on the  story  while leaving out key elements of why they were there in the first place ie missing court summons this is highly unethical and paints the federal government into a larger narrative that fox has been going for basically  rallying people by emotion not logic,5,
70914,this just in  there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government film at 1,5,
70915,student loans were made with certain assumptions about the future of the economy  both on the part of the schools  the tuition they charge   the lenders  and the student people should be required to pay their student loans but they should be adjusted downward  edit  this guy had a loan for  1500 measly bucks and did nt make any payments in 30 years  i would like to know if he was destitute  or just decided  fuck you everyone  i want to keep my money ,8,
70916,misleading title the marshals service will  arrest  you if you fail to show up for a court appearance you are not being tossed in jail  you are being hauled into court when you refused to answer a summons  from the article   paul aker says he was arrested at his home last week for a  1500 federal student loan he received in 1987  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  does anyone feel sorry for this man   1500  be serious,7,
70917,if i did nt pay back a federal loan for 29 years  i d kind of expect for there to be negative effects this dude did nt pay his loan  including when he was taken to court over it and received a judgment from the court specifically telling him to pay it if you ignore a court order  you re gon na have a bad time  i mean yes  the financial aid system needs to be fixed  but they re going after people who purposely are nt paying their loans which is a surprising amount of people  given how many refund chasers there are in the world for anyone else  there are programs like deferment options  sliding payscales  and whatever else along with loan forgiveness after 20 years  it s a shitty system  but this guy s case is not going to be the one to change it because he does nt deserve to have people dying on his hill for his particular cause,7,
70918,i m socialist and firmly believe that education and medical care should be paid for by federal government out of contributions that we make  however with that said  if you are contributing member of society you have to be a special kind of asshole not to repay  1500 loan over the period of 29 years no matter what was that loan used for,8,
70919,why is this news,3,
70920,dude got letters in his mail for months to pay and appear in court  this doesnt just come out of the blue he refused to show up to court multiple times thats a criminal offense,5,

70939,comcast   so what  it s not like you can leave me,9,
70940,comcast is used to pissing people off they wo nt give a fuck,9,
70941,you could probably just sticky this post  have no link from it or replies available that is how permanent of an issue this is,9,
70942,we want google fiber and we want it now,9,
70943,if a telephone company has this large a problem  they have to meet with the fcc and show cause most likely there would also be a hefty fine but  not cable networks because they are deemed nonessential,7,
70944,not news to me i have a 3 hour outage at least once a month with comcast a 1020 minute outage daily around 56 am  and at least 34 10 minute outages sprinkled throughout the week  i know this because 2 out of every 5 or 6 dvr recorded shows are fucked up during the middle   absolutely awful i live in a moderate city  too  so it s not like i m in the middle of fucking nowhere,7,
70945,and then they wonder why people are ready to go to google fibe,7,
70946,loss of internet and television access for 3 days would cause mass panic and riot,8,
70947,my bad people i went over my 300gb and used way too much of an infinite resource,7,
70948,wow  17k outages nationwide for as much as 3 hours  obama needs to step in and fix this for sure ,9,
70949,gt  across us i bet i could find thousands who are angry at comcast  in my town alone ,5,
70950,i m fully expecting to get downvoted to hell here  but what the heck  i m not particularly fond of comcast  but unless i missed something here  which is entirely possible   this does nt actually sound like it was particularly horrific for people in general it sounds like a very small fraction of their nationwide customer base  had an outage of parts of their service for about 3 or 4 hours  not even all of their service  but things like they could nt access their hd channels  or their internet did nt work for a few hours  i understand for businesses  an internet outage can be a big deal  so some outrage on their part would be justified  but for the general consumer  come on  get a grip go read a book for a while  or go outside for a bit  or  gasp  go do something with your family  i m just not getting what the huge deal was here  what am i missing,7,
70951,i was part of the outage did nt have internet and only had access to about 8 sd channels i ll be honest  3 hours where i have to use my phone for internetsi could nt care less had to go out and shovel anyway  edit  couldgt  could n,7,
70952,not a fan of comcast  but with this outage they probably still provide 9999  uptime bunch of whiners  yes  i work in it,6,
70953,i like how this is news in this country,7,
70954,comcast angers me even without outages,7,
70955,the words  anger  and  comcast  come up often,4,
70956,there needs to be legally mandated uptime and speed requirements  95  of the time your connection must reach the  advertised  speed  no more  up to xmbps  allowed  and 99  of the time it must reach 14 of that speed if this is nt met then customers must be completely refunded for that month,4,
70957,is anyone else still completely fucking down  just everything  been down for 15 hours here,4,
70958,quote from the article   comcast has more than 27 million customers  and 89000 of those are new cable subscribers the company signed on last quarter that was its best performance in eight years  correct me if i m wrong but are nt there 2 choices for most people  sign up with comcast or do nt have high speed internet  it s like bragging because people choose to eat food from the only supplier rather than starve to death,4,
70959,comcast seems to be an isp that people love to hate  charter got so bad for so many years that i loved to hate them in all honesty  the past three to four years or so they have been great,7,
70960,customer service replied   working as intended,3,
70961,i ve had comcast xfinity for almost 2 years now and i ve never had an issue,5,
70962,fun story i was at a friend s place watching the superbowl in denver comcast blacked out cbs with 1 minute 26 seconds left on the clock in second quarter  and service was nt restored till about 15 seconds before 3rd quarter kicked off  idk how widespread this was but lots of denverites did nt get to see the super bowl halftime show i d imagine comcast would lose a lot of money if their advertisers paid to have a certain amount of views and one of the biggest markets  since denver was participating in the super bowl  cut out all views during the entire halftime show idk how their whole contract with that stuff goes though  i hear i did nt miss much though,1,
70963,that s what happens things go out sometimes,3,
70964,friend of mine called to ask why he couldnt connect  he obviously cant check if there are outages in his neighborhood without the internet  he calls them and they offer to send a tech to his house for like  80  they didnt tell him the price  but you know itd be up there  he spends an hour checking all his connections  digging through paperwork to find his modem settings page  finally calls back about 8hrs later hoping to talk to someone else and theyre like   oh yeah  there s an outage in your area   idiots,1,
70965,when i called  i was disconnected 3 times this is great customer nonservice beside the lack of tv thanks comcast for helping me make my change from you  easier,1,
70966,it s nothing new that comcast absolutely sucks,1,
70967,when you deal with technology  there is only one thing i can guarantee you it will get down at the worst possible time,1,
70968, compact angers thousands across the us for something other than just being comcast for once  ftf,1,
70969,they just put a data cap on my home internet how fucked is that  pretty fucked if you ask me,1,
70970,what is the most troubling about comcast is that when there is an outtage  it doesnt effect just a small region  but instead downs multiple states that seems so rediculous,1,
70971,once they fix the outage you re left with  comcast anger thousands across us,1,
70972,now only 1000 years to lrrr ruler of the planet omicron persei 8 comes to destroy earth,1,
70973,it s not like we re losing  that  much more bandwidth it s only like 20 megs less than what we had before which was only 80 megs less than what we re paying for,1,
70974,so  i had to get comcast recently because i moved and noticed something weird about my bill the letter in the mail has a different due date than the due date that shows up on the online account just saying folks make sure to pay 2 days before your date at least,1,
70975,just having comcast in general makes them angry,1,
70976, nsfw how comcast really feels   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  kmcny_pixdw,1,
70977,once in a while fios is out for a few hours hard to get too pissed  these things do happen i do nt think comcast needs an outage to be hated honestly though for me they were a decent provider  i never had a single issue with them except for the occasional outage,1,
70978,wow now that s comcastic,1,
70979,it was out for like 3 hours jesus christ,1,
70980,my comcast service  for the first time in years  has actually been pretty good lately but i d like to pay less  so i m rooting for google fiber to come to boston simply so i can reap the benefits of competition  i mean  that s what we really want  right  we do nt want yet another monopoly  no matter how  altruistic  we think google will be  we want the existing monopolies to be forced into providing quality service for a reasonable price  along with other choices,1,
70981,it probably still worked better than my centurylink ds,1,
70982,comcast s response   it pays the restoration fee  or else it gets the hose again,1,
70983,my case  as in many others  boils down to this  you can pay triple the amount for the same throughput speeds or you can curse comcast and wait for google fiber,1,
70984,at the same time  i would nt want to be on the other end and get screamed at from 10k  people experiencing the outage i just went out instead of being at home it s aggregating that it happens so often  at the same time there are other things to d,1,
70985,they should just switch providers if they are nt satisfied  see what i did there ,1,
70986,after this comcast will just be turning off their services everywhere after all  they could save a ton of money that way,1,
70987,for comcast  it was tuesday,1,
70988,spread your cheeks  most of you wo nt even complain or ask for a billing credit,1,
70989,title should just be  comcast angers thousands across us   i fucking hate comcast with every fiber of my being  reasons  i  paying top dollar for slow as shit internet  ii  a modemrouter combo that broadcasts an unsecured public network from your home which has to be manually deactivated  iib  said modem has to be forced reset once a week  and doing so undoes the manual changes you made to get rid of the second network  iii  arbitrary data caps  iv  live television that freezes  v  ondemand that works infrequently  and turns into minecraft porn when it crashes  vi  customer  service  that refuses to listen to what your problem is  but instead tries to upsell you on a more advanced package  one of my dreams is to live long enough to see this shit stain regional monoploy of a company implode upon itself  or be run straight into the fucking grave by google fiber,1,
70990,i always laugh at this shit until i remember i m with twc  the   second   worst rated isp in america,1,

70998,he s only 69 years old  i had him pegged for going on 80,1,
70999,he s clearly at risk of fleeing  this is the only sane solution,1,

71006,how many hellfire missiles would that buy,8,
71007,this is a great thing people who are bashing him do not make much sense the monuments in dc are one of the united states  greatest treasures  and likewise they cost a lot to maintain let alone refurbish they are a public venue that is traversed by millions and are awesome to each person that visits  this guy decided to use some of his money to give back and better public places that reside in our nation capital and some see him as an asshole  it is one thing to be bitter about not having that kind of money  it is another thing to get pissed when someone with money gives back,7,
71008,its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring,3,
71009,good for him i remember the lincoln memorial being one of my more favorite monuments i d like to take my son there some day  so it s nice to see it will be upgraded and fixed up  to all the naysayers and negative commenters  fuck you,5,
71010,in this thread hooray  what an awesome guy and  also fuck him  he should have used pennie,6,

71013,how dare that onepercenter not keep that money to themselves it s as if they are nt evil like sanders wants you to believ,1,
71014,i think it s great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about what i do nt like is that there should nt even be an issue with funding for our monuments,4,
71015,if we re committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i m all for it,1,
71016,i wonder how many huge donations like this  maybe smaller  in the hundreds of thousands  have been made for national monuments pretty awesome someone did this wo reading the article  i have to imagine there s a good amount of rigmarole on the donor s end to ensure the donation goes to where the donor actually wanted govt accountability on any level in the us seems kind of weak lately,1,
71017,all right  a 15000sqft exhibit room underneathkind of like the one in fallout ,3,
71018,can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too,,
71019,oh cool thanks  philanthropist guy,3,
71020,wow  what an honorable thing to do  while 99  of people in his position would spend the money on useless crap  this guy chooses to spend his money on something so selfless and so much bigger than himself  this guy is a good 1  e,,
71021,it d be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro,1,
71022,that s nice for a full on rapist to do,,
71023,let s laugh at people in need by blowing tens of millions on nonessential shit that basically benefits nobody in any significant way  edit  and get tax breaks from it too,1,
71024,no matter what some peasant is going to whine rich guy should ve just kept his money to himself and these poors would nt even know  i thank him  i ll go to dc eventually the whiners here probably could nt afford any type of vacation  or if they could  only by living paycheck to paycheck,,
71025,we are living in a new gilded age,,
71026,i certainly appreciate what david has done here but  with all due respect to david  most americans would rather not see financial industry groups  like the carlyle group  suck economic resources out ofaway from most americans instead  we d prefer to pay for these efforts through widespread  robust economic opportunities and the tax contributions they make possible millions of americans and this nation have been greatly diminished as a result of the business activities of groups  like the carlyle group  over several decades  because of grotesque incomewealth inequality  the odds of seeing successful businesspeople like david rubinstein are greatly diminished he only got where he was because of the social ladder that used to exist in this nation,,
71027,how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions,,
71028,it s gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface themfight to take them down,,
71029,those goddamn rich people are at it again  dammit if we could only find a way to tax away their wealth so we could spend it on poorly negotiated deals for mediocre roads and bridges,,
71030,wow  what a waste of money,,
71031,fixing stupid shit is hardly philanthropy,,
71032,i m pretty sure there are roads around there that could have used that money  priorities  people,,

71039,well  that ought to take care of the problem,1,
71040,i like that guy after all  i would only do it for the money with minimal violence  and would never want to kill people so  if i ever decide to go and work for a cartel  i m  definitely  working for el jesus,1,
71041,is he hiring mercenaries  or he has enough already  it s also not a problem to join any military  as they re all doing god s work,1,
71042,well  if their since could nt be instantly forgiven  that might have had weight,1,
71043,clearly  jesus would prefer that you support the child rape industrial complex because that s how he rolls,1,

71046,gt  man wanted for 66 sex offenses with child i hope that is nt a craigslist ad,6,
71048,interesting though   since 2005  texas has prosecuted 38 juveniles for intoxication manslaughter or intoxication assault only three were sent to the adult system  and half of all cases resulted in probation of some kind  i think this is more telling of the justice system  and accessibility to competent  quality counsel it s clear money buys better legal counsel  but if the government subsidized public defense more heavily  the outcomes would clearly be different,9,
71049,cash is king in the world of corruption,9,
71050,i said this somwhere else  but it s also pertinent here  everyone is equal under the law and money is how we measure that equality,9,
71051,the difference  money,9,
71052,it s almost like the rich live under different rules,8,
71053,this is standard practice in the us judicial system outcomes will vary from case to case depending on financial status there s actually a legal term for it  it s called   cream ,9,
71054,my mom has always said guilty until proven rich,8,
71055,i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law this is the american dream,8,
71056,and liberty and justice for all  who can afford it ,5,
71057,i love how this article just glosses over the fact that arellano had previous dui convictions which is why he did nt receive the same sentence  this was couch s first dui case which is why he got probation  as texas takes the rehab route  but whatever lets rage and ignore the fact,8,
71058,is everyone here honestly  seriously shocked that money gets you out of trouble  am i taking crazy pills,5,
71059,going beyond the dae legal system is corrupt  circlejerk in this thread  there are certainly some differences in these cases firstly  the arellano case  the other one in the article  happened in 2007  six years before couch s trial likewise  the article says that arellano had driven while intoxicated and drank underage before  which means that he would ve had a greater chance of being moved to an adult trial meanwhile  couch had no prior violations of the law  meaning that he could nt be moved to an adult court,6,
71060,i understand what you are trying to do with your anecdotal case comparisons however  they are nt comparable cases when you consider all the factors  including criminal history  but  even if you ignore all the other factors  i know of a white 20 yo male from a fairly wealthy family in my area who was sent to prison for a year based on a drunk driving accident so my anecdotal evidence shows similar punishment to your anecdotal case thereby anecdotally refuting your point,8,
71061,the real crime here those eyebrow,6,
71062,gee  it s almost like different judges and prosecutors in different areas with separate cases can lead to different verdicts or something,6,
71063,that s why the case became famous because he got away while guilty that was autocorrect capitalization,4,
71064,affluenza is just a fake term that means the following  if you are rich  you do nt go to jail if you are not  you will spend 10 years like 95  of americans,4,
71065,let s be clear what happened to the poor kid was what s supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone you fucking go to prison couch was the exception,7,
71066,he did nt go free he was on probation and then he violated that  so he s going to jail,8,
71067,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,3,
71068,if someone is brought up too rich to not know the difference between right and wrong  why can the same argument not be used for poor people who commit crimes  people who are brought up in poverty do nt really know right from wrong just as much as a kid who has rich parents,3,
71069,that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time,3,
71070,  sees title   probably not a rich white kid   clicks article   and yuuuuuuuuuup sm,3,
71071,prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win,3,
71072,obviously as white god intended,4,
71073,i fucking hate ethan couch  i mean look at that look on his face disgusting i mean even his name is stupid,5,
71074,horrible headline  38 cases of dui manslaughter in texas since 2005 and only 3 of them went to adult court  that tells you the vast majority of these cases are handled with kid glovesso picking out one of 3 that went the other route and comparing it to the affluenza case is disingenuous  but fuck it  that is what the media does today god forbid they instead do an article focusing on how in texas if you are a drunk driving kid that kills people you will get away with it 35 out of 38 time,4,
71075,it did nt seem to mention how they had the same judge  we ve already established this same judge would have been open to giving a similar sentence to a poor minority because she tried to do just that keep making this a race issue  though lord knows the media loves to stir up ignorant poor folks  also  anyone who comes to the us illegally and kills is citizens deserves little sympathy he was a juvenile  so it would be appropriate to release him and deport him  i do nt understand the need to distort issues to make tbem about race we already have enough problems it s already an established fact that those with the means to afford a lawyer fair better than those who do nt,3,
71076,the difference  money,1,
71077,did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window,1,
71078,by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time,1,
71079,excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did,1,
71080,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,1,

71083,well  on one hand you have a kid that killed 3 adults and a child in a crash  and on the other a kid who killed a mother and her  unborn child  in a crash in a conservative state so he could have mowed down 10 born people and probably got less than what he gets for  accidentally  killing 1 unborn baby,1,

71085,this affluenza thing still baffles me  doing bad things because money  with that sort of logic hobos must be saints and not the crack heads living under bridges,1,
71086,no shit  i mean was nt the entire outrage that similar cases normally lead to prison in the first place,1,
71087,seriously  the rich kid,1,
71088,that s what  affluenza  means literally the entire point of this case and why it s been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich,1,
71089,i say it like my grandma used to  money talks  bullshit walks,1,
71090,he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows wtf,1,
71091,there s actually a legal question that you asked,1,

71093,biggest problem in the universe  vote it up  http  thebiggestproblemintheuniversecomepisode8,1,
71096,i ve never heard of court on a saturday thats pretty crazy,9,
71097,the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though,9,
71098,it should be interesting to see how she s ruled in cases of dui in the past,9,
71099,she refused a breathalyzer meh she ll beat thi,9,
71100,would nt being drunk compromise her ability to judge  how many times has she been impaired while working  should nt anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least  what should i make for dinner,9,
71101,offitherrrr i am the la,9,
71102,no one has mentioned this yet but she got pulled over at 8 am drinking in the morning  this judge has some problems,9,
71103,rochesterian here the article failed to mention that she was also driving with 2 flat tires for who knows how long,8,
71104,in fairness  if i was a judge in rochester i d need a few drinks before work too,9,

71110,what seems to be the officer  problem,6,
71111,well who s gon na judge the case now,5,
71112,her judgement was impaire,6,
71113,fry needs to weigh in here  http  imgurcomgvji0u,6,
71114,to be clear  the fact that she refused a breathalyzer is important in many states it is treated as evidence of impairment and justification for arrest she knew that i have many friends who are criminal defense attorneys and all have told me they advise to refuse breathalyzer always  unless there is a court order  i m not familiar with ny law  but i can pretty much guarantee she will not be convicted of dui if middle classcollege kids can get out of them  a federal judge surely can since it said nothing about a field sobriety test  i assume they either did nt administer one  or they did and she did not meet criteria for impairment,5,
71115,my friends mom is a judge and that lady boozes super hard and will drive her car around i have seen her come home from the bar completely in ruins at least a dozen times over the last 10 years she is fearless  we live in a small town in wisconsin with a huge police presence she knows all the officers and has never had an issue the whole situation seems completely ridiculous she gives out sentences for dui all day and then drives drunk all night oh god  the hypocrisy,5,
71116,ny state troopers only care about the star program more tixarrest  promotionmoney so if they could get points on there own mother they would,5,

71118,regardless of judge plates  why shouldare judges treated any differently  if i expect to get pulled over and ticketed for 5mph over i believe a judge should too especially since they make 15 times the income,5,
71119,i feel like poor judgement like this should make you not a judge anymore,4,

71132,we want google fiber and we want it now,9,
71133,if a telephone company has this large a problem  they have to meet with the fcc and show cause most likely there would also be a hefty fine but  not cable networks because they are deemed nonessential,7,
71134,not news to me i have a 3 hour outage at least once a month with comcast a 1020 minute outage daily around 56 am  and at least 34 10 minute outages sprinkled throughout the week  i know this because 2 out of every 5 or 6 dvr recorded shows are fucked up during the middle   absolutely awful i live in a moderate city  too  so it s not like i m in the middle of fucking nowhere,7,
71135,and then they wonder why people are ready to go to google fibe,7,
71136,loss of internet and television access for 3 days would cause mass panic and riot,8,
71137,my bad people i went over my 300gb and used way too much of an infinite resource,7,
71138,wow  17k outages nationwide for as much as 3 hours  obama needs to step in and fix this for sure ,9,
71139,gt  across us i bet i could find thousands who are angry at comcast  in my town alone ,5,
71140,i m fully expecting to get downvoted to hell here  but what the heck  i m not particularly fond of comcast  but unless i missed something here  which is entirely possible   this does nt actually sound like it was particularly horrific for people in general it sounds like a very small fraction of their nationwide customer base  had an outage of parts of their service for about 3 or 4 hours  not even all of their service  but things like they could nt access their hd channels  or their internet did nt work for a few hours  i understand for businesses  an internet outage can be a big deal  so some outrage on their part would be justified  but for the general consumer  come on  get a grip go read a book for a while  or go outside for a bit  or  gasp  go do something with your family  i m just not getting what the huge deal was here  what am i missing,7,
71141,i was part of the outage did nt have internet and only had access to about 8 sd channels i ll be honest  3 hours where i have to use my phone for internetsi could nt care less had to go out and shovel anyway  edit  couldgt  could n,7,
71142,not a fan of comcast  but with this outage they probably still provide 9999  uptime bunch of whiners  yes  i work in it,6,
71143,i like how this is news in this country,7,
71144,comcast angers me even without outages,7,
71145,the words  anger  and  comcast  come up often,4,
71146,there needs to be legally mandated uptime and speed requirements  95  of the time your connection must reach the  advertised  speed  no more  up to xmbps  allowed  and 99  of the time it must reach 14 of that speed if this is nt met then customers must be completely refunded for that month,4,
71147,is anyone else still completely fucking down  just everything  been down for 15 hours here,4,
71148,quote from the article   comcast has more than 27 million customers  and 89000 of those are new cable subscribers the company signed on last quarter that was its best performance in eight years  correct me if i m wrong but are nt there 2 choices for most people  sign up with comcast or do nt have high speed internet  it s like bragging because people choose to eat food from the only supplier rather than starve to death,4,
71149,comcast seems to be an isp that people love to hate  charter got so bad for so many years that i loved to hate them in all honesty  the past three to four years or so they have been great,7,
71150,customer service replied   working as intended,3,
71151,i ve had comcast xfinity for almost 2 years now and i ve never had an issue,5,
71152,fun story i was at a friend s place watching the superbowl in denver comcast blacked out cbs with 1 minute 26 seconds left on the clock in second quarter  and service was nt restored till about 15 seconds before 3rd quarter kicked off  idk how widespread this was but lots of denverites did nt get to see the super bowl halftime show i d imagine comcast would lose a lot of money if their advertisers paid to have a certain amount of views and one of the biggest markets  since denver was participating in the super bowl  cut out all views during the entire halftime show idk how their whole contract with that stuff goes though  i hear i did nt miss much though,1,
71153,that s what happens things go out sometimes,3,
71154,friend of mine called to ask why he couldnt connect  he obviously cant check if there are outages in his neighborhood without the internet  he calls them and they offer to send a tech to his house for like  80  they didnt tell him the price  but you know itd be up there  he spends an hour checking all his connections  digging through paperwork to find his modem settings page  finally calls back about 8hrs later hoping to talk to someone else and theyre like   oh yeah  there s an outage in your area   idiots,1,
71155,when i called  i was disconnected 3 times this is great customer nonservice beside the lack of tv thanks comcast for helping me make my change from you  easier,1,
71156,it s nothing new that comcast absolutely sucks,1,
71157,when you deal with technology  there is only one thing i can guarantee you it will get down at the worst possible time,1,
71158, compact angers thousands across the us for something other than just being comcast for once  ftf,1,
71159,they just put a data cap on my home internet how fucked is that  pretty fucked if you ask me,1,
71160,what is the most troubling about comcast is that when there is an outtage  it doesnt effect just a small region  but instead downs multiple states that seems so rediculous,1,
71161,once they fix the outage you re left with  comcast anger thousands across us,1,
71162,now only 1000 years to lrrr ruler of the planet omicron persei 8 comes to destroy earth,1,
71163,it s not like we re losing  that  much more bandwidth it s only like 20 megs less than what we had before which was only 80 megs less than what we re paying for,1,
71164,so  i had to get comcast recently because i moved and noticed something weird about my bill the letter in the mail has a different due date than the due date that shows up on the online account just saying folks make sure to pay 2 days before your date at least,1,
71165,just having comcast in general makes them angry,1,
71166, nsfw how comcast really feels   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  kmcny_pixdw,1,
71167,once in a while fios is out for a few hours hard to get too pissed  these things do happen i do nt think comcast needs an outage to be hated honestly though for me they were a decent provider  i never had a single issue with them except for the occasional outage,1,
71168,wow now that s comcastic,1,
71169,it was out for like 3 hours jesus christ,1,
71170,my comcast service  for the first time in years  has actually been pretty good lately but i d like to pay less  so i m rooting for google fiber to come to boston simply so i can reap the benefits of competition  i mean  that s what we really want  right  we do nt want yet another monopoly  no matter how  altruistic  we think google will be  we want the existing monopolies to be forced into providing quality service for a reasonable price  along with other choices,1,
71171,it probably still worked better than my centurylink ds,1,
71172,comcast s response   it pays the restoration fee  or else it gets the hose again,1,
71173,my case  as in many others  boils down to this  you can pay triple the amount for the same throughput speeds or you can curse comcast and wait for google fiber,1,
71174,at the same time  i would nt want to be on the other end and get screamed at from 10k  people experiencing the outage i just went out instead of being at home it s aggregating that it happens so often  at the same time there are other things to d,1,
71175,they should just switch providers if they are nt satisfied  see what i did there ,1,
71176,after this comcast will just be turning off their services everywhere after all  they could save a ton of money that way,1,
71177,for comcast  it was tuesday,1,
71178,spread your cheeks  most of you wo nt even complain or ask for a billing credit,1,
71179,title should just be  comcast angers thousands across us   i fucking hate comcast with every fiber of my being  reasons  i  paying top dollar for slow as shit internet  ii  a modemrouter combo that broadcasts an unsecured public network from your home which has to be manually deactivated  iib  said modem has to be forced reset once a week  and doing so undoes the manual changes you made to get rid of the second network  iii  arbitrary data caps  iv  live television that freezes  v  ondemand that works infrequently  and turns into minecraft porn when it crashes  vi  customer  service  that refuses to listen to what your problem is  but instead tries to upsell you on a more advanced package  one of my dreams is to live long enough to see this shit stain regional monoploy of a company implode upon itself  or be run straight into the fucking grave by google fiber,1,

71191,i have been calling the helpline everyday for 2 weeks it is a recorded message saying call back later we are busy just then general va helpline,7,
71192,the problem with the va  like most other government agencies  is that there is no accountability when you ca nt fire workers who are lazy  negligent  or worthless  you end up with a disfunctional organization filled with lazy  negligent  and worthless people,7,
71193,yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country,4,
71194,i have a pretty easy solution  why do nt overflow suicide calls just get forwarded to the regular suicide hotline  s   sure its probably better to deal with someone specifically trained to deal with service men and women but anyone is better then a voicemail,6,

71201,remember when the va story broke it was really big news and everyone was talking about it and it was front page on reddit  nothing s changed  stories keep coming out about how nothing s changed  but no one cares either because it s not new anymore  or because of politics  or maybe both i do nt know,1,

71237, every  prepackaged shredded cheese has it it s the most common anticlumping agent used around the world the argument is that the labels said 100  cheese,9,
71238,labels should be accurate end of story if the product inside does not match the label ingredients  it is fraud and should be prosecuted as such,8,
71239,that s why you buy a little wedge of parm and use a microplane grater on it to shave cheese onto your pasta the wedge lasts a very long time  and in the end it s cheaper than the nasty jars,7,
71240,cellulose is the actual substance you ll find it in all pregrated cheeses these guys were just busted putting too much in to save    lettuce is also made of cellulose where commercial outfits get it for cheese  i guess could be just about any plant judged edible  including  sure  trees  also who knows what kind of cheese you re supposedly getting much nicer to get a hunk of the real stuff and a crank grater  my knuckles hate box graters with a passion ,8,
71241,so my penne has wood,7,
71242,so the correct labeling is 92  cheese and 8  wood filler  i think that s right,6,
71243,solution  buy your parmesan  domestic or real  and grate it yourself tastes better too if you re really lazy  grate it and freeze until you need it,7,

71264,lansing has actually dealt with this problem and their civil engineers have a solution which is both fast and more costeffective than traditional measures they connect the end of the new pipe to the old pipes so when they pull out the old pipe they simultaneously thread the new pipes into the existing space this speeds up the process and the people in lansing estimate with adequate training  involving them with the process in flint  and hiring enough crews it can be completed for flint in one year,7,
71265,this whole situation is a national embarrassment  and it makes my blood boil  but what does naacp have to do with city water  is it a race issue as well  i ve never seen the demographics on flint  come to think of it  maybe aspca should get involved  too i bet people are still feeding their pets city water no matter what  edit  i just think it should be about officials   doing their fucking jobs    framing it as a race issue might just come back to bite us  who knows how many towns are discreetly checking for  and finding  elevated lead  should it matter how many african americans live there  if so  how should officials proceed differently  will it result in a process of public relations triage  that prioritizes black communities  public officials just need to do their fucking jobs for the public they serve there s no need to complicate this with race,5,

71299,so this guy is innocent until proven guilty right  why is this investigation so short  we do nt know the details  why does it take a year to investigate an officer for shooting someone  and this takes a couple of days to charge this guy  is that disconnect enough to make anyone here question things enough to accept that there is a massive encompassing problem with our legal system  i always have to wonder because we see many of the same people calling for people to wait for details after an officer shoots someone  telling us not to be monday morning quarterbacks then stories like this pop up and we have those same people frothing at the mouth in this situation where it has nt been given the year plus of investigation that an officer who shoots someone would be given the guy is already guilty despite the cries to give officers the benefit of the doubt because of the innocent until proven principle,,

71303,maybe the cop was making furtive movements,,
71306,colleges really need to stop expelling students due to these kangaroo courts  i m fine with them if it s from breaking a school infraction like alcohol on a dry campus or something of that sort but  if a student is accused of a criminal offense  let the courts deal with it and decide from there  schools are nt equipped to deal with these kinds of cases  nor should they be expected to be these are lifechanging accusations and need to be treated as such  for the benefit of both parties involved,9,
71307,gt  ut investigators later decided  that the evidence supported a finding that  he  had sexually assaulted ms roe  the opposite of the conclusion reached by the more experienced detectives of the police department   the lawsuit says the dean of students then recommended he be expelled  ah but the police are looking for evidence that he did it  college tribunals assume he did and require he provide evidence that he did nt  which  typically  the accused is not allowed to present,9,
71308,gt  one plaintiff is a 24yearold recent graduate  the other is a 21yearold student who is one semester away from graduating with a bachelor  s degree in physics  their lawsuits say   in the graduate  s case  he faces being banned from any ut system campus  being denied a shot at a ut graduate degree and having a notation put on his transcript   the undergrad faces expulsion in addition to the same punishments  that does nt make any sense to me why would an institution retroactively amend the transcript of someone  who already graduated  to say this person violated school policy  after graduating   this seems to be more evidence that they re trying to scapegoat the plaintiffs here i mean  if they were concerned with the alleged victim s wellbeing more than trying to look  tough on sexual assault   what is the point of amending the transcript,9,
71309,who s the idiot who decided that kangaroo courts were a good idea,9,
71310,are we to the point where  sexual assaultrape  almost no longer have a meaning    you getting hammered and hooking up with a hammered guy is not rape  nor is it assault he should sue her for the exact same thing,8,
71311,i once saw a swedish movie called ondskan   evil  that drove me to become a lawyer today  here  https  enwikipediaorgwikievil_  2003_film   plot one of the key issues that caught my attention in this movie is the disregard of the law the school had to the protagonist s rights when he hired a lawyer  because of some grievance he had with the school  it backed off immediatly when the lawyer lay down the letter of the law to the headmaster of that educational institution in front of all his guests  in this university of texas sexual assault case  i believe imhlo  l is for legal   that the constitution sets a foundation of rules for everyone inside it s jurisdiction  and no internal policy that ut may have can go against the rules set by the us constitution everyone should enjoy the right of being innocent until proven guilty  and time and time again people are being layed off their jobs  students expelled  lives ruined because of yettobeproven  accusations  the right thing that any institution  like ut  should always do is address all cases of criminal behavior by always recognizing first the accused innocence until proven guilty in a court of law  edit  grammar,8,
71312,gt  the friend said she thought the woman was conscious because  when she saw her kissing this man  she was awake and talking  the lawsuit says  so intentionally or not the woman who claimed to be assaulted is not telling the truth  editand they decided to expel him without even talking to the student his first chance to give his side was an appeal for his expulsion this is a fucking kangaroo court  edit2  the second lawsuit claims expulsion against a student was recommended without the alleged victim ever personally making a sex assault accusation  http  kxancom20160205lawsuitsagainstutallegebiasagainstmalesinsexassaultcase,9,
71313,gt  the undergrad  s lawsuit says he had sex with a woman who was not a ut student after leaving a house party near campus sometime after midnight on march 6  2015 about a month later  the woman  s father called ut police and accused the man of sexually assaulting his daughter  fuck this i understand that if a woman is  actually  rapedmolestedassaulted it could be hard to come forward  but waiting a month or longer and  then  reporting it is bullshit you get raped  you report it immediately the longer you wait  the more i m going to doubt your accusation,7,
71314,gt  university police never spoke to the woman the undergrad was accused of assaulting and no criminal charges were ever pursued  his lawsuit says the father  s report was referred to the ut dean of students  okay what the hell  seriously  though its this sort of thing that makes me really hate schools handling sexual assault cases on their own the police did nt even talk to the accused victim  but decided to tell the dean instead  it feels like it happens all the time when we have these alternate systems of punishment we stop treating crimes like crimes and treat them like rule infractions a rule infraction is cheating on a test an alleged assault is a crime treat it like one,7,
71315,eli5 kangaroo courts thanks,8,
71316,activist administrators  check lack of due process  check prohibited from legal council or cross examination of the accuser  check nothin to see here  move along people,6,
71317,well  they are probably right these school kangaroo courts have demonstrated they have no respect for the privacy and rights of the accused  and are only interested in demonstrating how seriously they take sexual assault accusations,6,
71318,male privilege,8,
71319,the real lesson here is do nt trust anyone i certainly do nt anymore,6,
71320,reddit is nt okay with witch hunts  but the university of texas and 1600s salem encourage them,7,
71321,stay away from liberal colleges  they are cesspools of tumblrina ideals  i could barely stand the required diversity classes from my public university nothing but priviledge  patriarchy  and man hatin,8,
71322,it seems to me that a public institution has to follow the sixth amendment  which grants  the right to a public trial without unnecessary delay  the right to a lawyer  the right to an impartial jury  and the right to know who your accusers are and the nature of the charges and evidence against you,6,
71323,jane roe because jane doe would be incest,4,
71324,so these students that are expelled do they have to still pay back their loans even though they do nt get a degree now and can they carry their credits over to another school or are they now worthless,5,
71325,i love how at the end she implies that if there were a person punching people randomly on campus they would choose to not involve the police presumably so that the assault victims could  control their own destiny,3,
71326,30 year old here  and planning on returning to school with all this insanity about social values exploding everywhere  i may just hold off a few more years and wait for school to become a profitable idea again,3,
71327,gt  the university has been placed under enormous political pressure to appear tough on those accused of sexual assault  there s your problem right there how about be tough on those convicted of sexual assault and those whom the law decides are innocent be treated as such,3,
71328,umso expel the drunken slut too  right  i could get behind that they both got drunk and made bad choices that reflect poorly on the school kick em both out  why only the male  did he conspire in some way to get her drunk  if they re both adults that got drunk and fucked then they re both equally guilty,7,
71329,considering that almost every case of a rape accusation that s come out massively public has been shown to be fraudulent  i m reserving judgement on this one,3,
71330, ut investigates more than 100 allegations of sexual assault a year  and that number is growing  liebman said   how the hell are there hundreds of allegations a year that s insane this reminds me of the play the crucible  i saw you with the devilcommunistscapitalists  homo raptorus,1,
71331,damned if you do damned if you dont,1,
71332,seems like the girl was so hammered that she could nt remember the sex figured it would be less shameful if she accused him of assault,1,
71335,yes please too big to fail means they are too big  period break them apart,8,
71336,this seems like a no brainer not saying it will be easy  but why ever have banks too large to fail even exist,9,
71337,absolutely agree  but it will likely go nowhere it really is nt any different than when the government stepped in and broke up atamp  t into the baby bells unfortunately  this is talk by those who have no power to enforce change,6,
71338,seems like a good move if you re too big to fail  you are clearly in violation of antitrust and monopoly legislation  surely  plus  anything that is too big to fail is clearly just a bad idea from the standpoint of a societies ability to sustain unexpected shocks and surprises,7,
71339,big banks and wall street bank elections for both parties not going to happen unless supreme court reverses  citizens united  ruling allowing corporations to donate unlimited amount of funds to politicians and political parties as long as such bribery is legal  no politician will bite the hand that feeds himher,4,
71340,this is a political talking point floated to make sanders look like an over reactor if andor when he loses the nomination this guy and his idea will disappear from sight,5,
71341,hopefully  his floating that idea wo nt end up with him floating in the river,4,
71342,kashkari  eh  so  how does goldman sachs make money off of this,4,
71343,eh  wake me when they actually start breaking them up for now this is just more idle talk,4,
71344,i guess they could nt find a picture that makes him look crazier,4,
71345,if there are any economists here  i have a question how do we know that this wo nt have the same results as breaking up telecoms  regional monopolies collude until one is more successful and one starts to fail the successful one buys the failing one then this process repeats until the most successful one is enormous again  but with writeoffs  layoffs and debts thanks to the less successful ones consumers get screwed by footing the bill for the whole failed experiment  if telecoms can do that  why would we assume that banks wo nt just do the same thing  to the effect of even more pain for consumers,4,
71346,oh hey  it s the guy who ran for california governor,3,
71347,news update  spontaneous fires erupt in rome,3,
71348,no if we break up banks or make them have more capital  they will invest less  and folks on reddit will say its too hard to get a loan the banks will now actually want to make sure folks can actually pay back the loan  and a lot of folks have no assets  and will cry its not fair   only the rich are getting the loans    since they already have assets   are you sure you want to hold banks accountable  personally  i think its a great idea  but not sure you all realize the banks will just push that accountability back on you,3,
71349,that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money,1,
71350,probably not that big of a problem anymore they ve plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 20 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become,1,
71351,looks as though he s beginning a political career as a goldman  fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him asshole,1,
71352,breaking up huge banks reduces the chance that banks will get the giant bailouts the did after 2008 failures  massive corporate welfare they will lobby hard against the potential loss of a free ride,1,
71353,godless commie socialism yes pleas,1,
71354, flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca nt fail  did anyone else see this   wtf  so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further,1,
71355,trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it,1,
71356,from my armchair  i d say that the entire banking sector needs to be deleveraged 301 leverage  or whatever it currently is  is too much slowly  over time  to prevent shocks from the deleveraging   deleverage the banks  and it would make it harder for a crisis to become systemic,1,
71357,kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying,1,
71358,kashkari was part of the paulson team that leveraged the american banking empire into toobigtofail and now that that leverage is proving to be dangerous for the survival of the one per cent kleptocrats he wants to break up the tbtf banks  geithner knew this would manifest when he used tbtf as a stopgap measure to save the synagogue of satan worshiping kleptocracy of fraudsters that run the federal reserve now that same kleptocracy wants to be bailed out once again because geithner s temporary solution has run it s course straight into the gutter where geithner amp  kashkari et al  belong  up yours  america the functional retard,,
71360,that article is really light on details  does anyone know why this happened  did the guy not respond to a court summons or something along those lines  is nt a default the judgement the usual result in that situation,9,
71361,this happened in feb  2003 in minnesota as well  article   http  wwwmndailycom20030214usmarshalsarreststudentloandebtorstwincities,9,
71362,what happens if you literally ca nt pay your loans  asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11  just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job  edit  something a lot of you do nt seem to realize is that these were private loans there s no forgiveness with those,9,
71363,not really too much context given here  so it s hard to guess at the actual situation  but federal student loans  at least direct loans and the majority of those older loans passed back to fsa as they phased out the guarantee programs  do nt get sold to private collection agencies at this time maybe that part happened a while back  before current policies went into place and the collectors are taking advantage of the protections that federallyoriginated loans have  anyway  for people who are interested in learning more about how defaulted federal student loans are being collected today   check this out   https  wwwfbogovindex  s  opportunityamp  mode  formamp  id  216a8418f8e71f0c9c3475946ab100f8amp  tab  coreamp  _cview  1  they re currently in the middle of contracting new private collection agencies to service defaulted loans and you can see in the rfp documents how agencies are being scored and how that ties into account assignments  basically  for those who do nt feel like running through all of it  the big emphasis for student loan collections now is getting people through affordable rehabilitation options and into incomedriven repayment plans placements look like they re going to be based about 50  on careful regulatory compliance and borrower satisfaction surveys  which would make it extremely difficult for high pressure collections tactics to work out in the long run  none of that changes this story  just thought it was interesting in light of some of the comments i ve read that indicate people believe strongarm collection tactics for student loans will always be the norm  tldr  they re at least trying to throw a friendly paint job over the horribly broken federal student loan system these days,9,
71364,if you dont show up to court after you have been served this is what happens he has been ignoring collection attempts  he got served and ignored that too im not in favor of this man being arrested but you cant ignore court summons if you get served you have to go,9,
71365,upconwell said it best  gt  you are reading way to much into the article no one said they were violent no one said they had their guns drawn they are us marshals  they carry guns  every god damn day   gt  they probably went to his door  knocked he answered and they said  hey  we have a warrant for you for failing to appear in a federal court   he probably said  oh shit let me get some pants  gt  no violence  no guns drawn  everything was pretty standard and nonviolent  gt  plus  it should be noted that he was not arrested for failing to pay student loans  he was arrested for violating a court order,9,
71366,how do you not pay a  1500 loan after 30 friggin years,9,
71367,gt  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  this almost reads like satire,9,
71368,i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors,9,
71369,where in this article did it say  guns drawn  as most people are stating here  it says  with guns   every on duty us marshal goes through their day  with guns   someone signed a contract for a loan  and then spends almost three decades not paying it i agree that a police force should nt have been used there are financial measures that can be taken upon default of a loan rather than criminal  but i m really surprised by the circle jerk that s happening over a fox news article,9,
71370,can i get a misleading title please,8,
71371,you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day,6,
71372,lol  you guys are so gullible the guy dodged this debt and refused to engage the proper authorities for 25 years this is nt a new college graduate that missed one payment then you have the cascade of predictable posts stating  boot lickers    debtors prison  and how in 30 years this will be the watershed moment we all look back to as we are enslaved by the government this is a statement case the feds took an extreme example and made an extreme example of this putz the goal of this action is compliance and to get folks to not ignore their obligations the money spent on this will scare the other million folks that are past due to actually pick up the phone and engage them to resolve the debt no one held a gun to this guy s head to sign up for the student loans and no one was stopping him for 25 years from making a payment plan for the remaining  1500 this guy deserved it and as a tax payer this is ok by me,9,
71373,real story here dude was sued by the united state of america  he refused to appear  a default judgment was issued against him  he refused to appear for postjudgment depositions  judge issued an order directing him to appear in court  he ignored it and then the judge issued an arrest warrantincareration order and federal judges use us marshalls to enforce their orders  so he was nt arrested for having old student loans he was arrested for refusing to comply with a direct order from the judge  http  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386htm,8,
71374,that dude could not come up with  1500 in 29 years,8,
71375, a few years ago congress allowed the private sector to contract for student loan collections and so you have these private companies who are doing this  i find this scary  even though i have no student loans to pay off they dragged this dude to court and made him sign an agreement in front of their private attorney he had no attorney present  and was nt read any rights  edit  quote is from the video,9,
71376,forever grateful i graduated with minimal student loans ca nt ignore bills for 25 years though  regardless of what those payments stem from from reading through the comments here  it seems like incomebased payment option is the smartest option,6,
71377,i wish my student loan balance was  1500,6,
71378,i knew this story was light on facts turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies  source   yahoo finance   https  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386html,6,
71379,gt  our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is nt the first and wo nt be the last  this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least,8,
71380,he was nt arrested for not paying his loan  he was arrested for not showing up in court  and the marshals did nt storm his house guns blazing they had guns  with them   like every other cop in the entire country,7,
71381,if you take money and have no plans on paying it back  it s called stealing,9,
71382,right the debt collectors just bought the debt  payed the filing fees to bring the case to court  threatened the man with their now official   pay us or else  and when he did not they used their settlement to have him arrested by the marshals nope  no government officers for hire here  just good old debt collection paid and serviced through the courts,5,
71383,til that most people have no understanding how the court system works  yes  civil attorneys can issue subpoenas  yes  a court can hold you in contempt if you fail to appear yes  a potential punishment for contempt is a bench warrant for your arrest  tl  dr  you can not simply ignore subpoenas you may go to jail,5,
71384,writing and publishing articles like this is dangerous the author offered a sensationalist angle on the  story  while leaving out key elements of why they were there in the first place ie missing court summons this is highly unethical and paints the federal government into a larger narrative that fox has been going for basically  rallying people by emotion not logic,5,
71385,this just in  there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government film at 1,5,
71386,student loans were made with certain assumptions about the future of the economy  both on the part of the schools  the tuition they charge   the lenders  and the student people should be required to pay their student loans but they should be adjusted downward  edit  this guy had a loan for  1500 measly bucks and did nt make any payments in 30 years  i would like to know if he was destitute  or just decided  fuck you everyone  i want to keep my money ,8,
71387,misleading title the marshals service will  arrest  you if you fail to show up for a court appearance you are not being tossed in jail  you are being hauled into court when you refused to answer a summons  from the article   paul aker says he was arrested at his home last week for a  1500 federal student loan he received in 1987  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  does anyone feel sorry for this man   1500  be serious,7,
71388,if i did nt pay back a federal loan for 29 years  i d kind of expect for there to be negative effects this dude did nt pay his loan  including when he was taken to court over it and received a judgment from the court specifically telling him to pay it if you ignore a court order  you re gon na have a bad time  i mean yes  the financial aid system needs to be fixed  but they re going after people who purposely are nt paying their loans which is a surprising amount of people  given how many refund chasers there are in the world for anyone else  there are programs like deferment options  sliding payscales  and whatever else along with loan forgiveness after 20 years  it s a shitty system  but this guy s case is not going to be the one to change it because he does nt deserve to have people dying on his hill for his particular cause,7,
71389,i m socialist and firmly believe that education and medical care should be paid for by federal government out of contributions that we make  however with that said  if you are contributing member of society you have to be a special kind of asshole not to repay  1500 loan over the period of 29 years no matter what was that loan used for,8,
71390,why is this news,3,
71391,dude got letters in his mail for months to pay and appear in court  this doesnt just come out of the blue he refused to show up to court multiple times thats a criminal offense,5,
71392,the revolution will not be subsidize,5,
71393,the whole student loan thing is a complete disaste,6,
71394,talk is cheap  between the intelligence agencies  an the lack of marijuana decriminalizatoinlegalizatoin  obama is nt that idfferent from previous administration,5,
71395,just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to the paper really is nt worth it otherwise college is becoming a joke anyways,5,
71396,every interaction i have ever had with navient  they have done everything they can to work with me  is your payment affordable  would you like a deferment  etc  i have had to take them up on that because of divorce not saying that is everyone s experience but they have nt been the loan sharks everyone else seems to act like they are just one man s experience though,5,
71399,funny how employers get to steal from employees  and if they are caught  they simply have to repay the employee what they are owed nobody gets charged  nobody goes to jail  meanwhile  if an employee steals from an employer  they get charged  fined  and probably spend some time in jail ditto for customers who steal  i wonder why people hate the government and rich people,8,
71400,hopefully australia has a similar thing to the usa where prisoners are paid like 47 cents per day,6,
71401,not as bad as actual slaves that work in unpaid internships,5,
71402,well  when the tpp goes through we ll all get to enjoy such working conditions  the fact of the matter is that this occurs constantly  the authorities refuse to investigate and the workers lack the leverage to bring the employers to court,1,
71403,here in the us the government would go after ahmed and not see an issue with what was going on monetarily  edit  some of you really need to step away from the computer and not take this place so seriously,,
71404,seriously why are we  the usa  importing workers on visas to work at 711s,,
71408,i was happier before i knew this subculture existed,9,
71409,so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10 that does nt make much sense,9,
71410,how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killedhow from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human,9,
71411,one of these videos was sent to me many years ago  forwarded on a myspace page  yeah  many  years ago   they were trying to  raise awareness  when they sent it to me to help the people get caught  but all they really ended up doing was spreading that ghastly thing to more points of the internet i wo nt describe a single second of it  but suffice it to say that it s horrifying i ve never been able to remove the memory i ve been through a lot in my military career  and yet seeing a 2minute version of one of those videos was easily the most horrible thing i have ever witnessed,9,
71412,gt  brent justice  54  was convicted and sentenced monday for cruelty to nonlivestock animals  i guess justice has been served,9,
71413,i ca nt imagine the mentality of the person making it or watching it and people get off on it    who the hell sees a cat being stabbed in the eye and thinks  hey  time to get the jergens  ,9,
71414,no complaints from me but i ve noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago,9,
71415,for once  reading a story of horrifying animal abuse does nt fill me with rage this must be what justice feels like finally  an appropriate sentence so sick of people like these getting slaps on the wrist due to inadequate animal protection laws,9,
71416,i read the title then thought  hhmmm what s an animal crush video   who would have thunk it  animal crush videos are videos of animals getting crushed there goes some of the little remaining faith i had in humanit,9,
71417,psa  if for some reason you come here first  and you do nt know what crush videos are  please do nt look them up,8,
71418,i m not saying this is nt some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder,9,
71419,who the fuck beats off to animals being killed  what the fuc,7,
71420,i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens wtfi just dont understan,8,
71421,houston man is trying to compete with florida man  and this is definitely an act i hope florida man does nt try to top,8,
71422,there are some very fucked up people in this world to me  it is inconceivable how someone does this,8,

71427,i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective it was the first exposure i d ever had to this subculture  crush fetish   after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals  their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse that s all i have to say about that,1,
71429,as someone who just for the first time heard the term animal crush videos  i wash that i had nt something is seriously wrong with you if this is what gets you off,7,
71430,well that just ruined my da,6,
71431,i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed ,4,
71432,fuck people are fucked,5,
71433,if slaughter houses had glass walls  everyone would quit eating animals the cognitive dissonance in here is incredible,5,
71434,i definitely think this guy should be punished and i m glad he was punished  but it blow my mind how a guy like this can get 50 years and a pedophile or rapist can get 1020 or less,5,
71435,i do nt understand how the sicko who did the maiming and killing gets 10 years  but the man who filmed it gets 50 that woman should not see light ever again,1,
71438,i lived 200yds from a burn pit when i was there in 04 i had some skin disease for about 2 years after iraq and some kind of asthma the va did nt give a shit then and they still do nt care  so  i got that goin for me,9,
71439,i was in tikrit  cob speicher  from 08 to 09 i lived a few hundred feet from the  burn pit  it was basically a huge junk yard with 3 huge constantly burning rectangular pits they were about 75 feet long and 50 feet across iirc you could see black or white smoke billowing from the area all the time i had to go there at least once a week to dump trash imagine standing over a red hot fire throwing junk off the back of a flatbed truck while it was 130 degrees outside sometimes the smog was so thick driving through the junk yard  that you could nt see 50 feet in front of you the smoke would almost always linger around the base and it smelled awful olfactory fatigue did not apply here it always smelled no matter how long you d be  exposed  you never got used to it never mind that they burned our shit right next door i remember one day we had to do a pt test the 2 mile run was on the same road as the burn pit smoke everywhere nobody passed that day some people were puking at the end i usually ran a 13  45 2 mile and i remember getting over 17 minutes i was gasping for air at the end we all thought the course was marked out incorrectly  but when we measured it later that day it was exactly 2 miles needless to say  nobody ever had any respiratory protection around these things  ever nor were we ever told we needed them i mean we had our gas masks in our gear  but nobody wanted to be  that guy  damn  we used to joke about it all the time whenever someone would start spewing some  war story   or when some freshoutabasic private would try to tell us about  that one time my drill sergeant made us do this  story   at the end we d say   yeah  but have you ever been to the burn pit    then we d laugh it off i guess it s not so funny anymore,8,
71440,my husband  half  jokes about the cancer he s going to get from the burn pits in afghanistan from what he described  they were horrible,7,
71441,this hits close to home we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight i really need to get this checked out,7,
71442,i can understand why burning trash and human waste may be unavoidable in certain military circumstances like in those remote outposts in afghanistan that might house 1520 people  there really are nt any good alternatives  however it seems less defensible to not have invested in better infrastructure once you had permanent bases the size of small cities  once you re at the point where soldiers had their own little airconditioned houses made out of cargo containers with air conditioning  satellite television  and onbase burger king it seems like you can probably invest in some proper trash incinerators instead of open burn pits,7,
71443,gt  though the us government disputes it well  color me surprised,8,
71444,a tsgt i know died recently from cancer he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family he was 32 his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer,7,
71445, support our troops with a ribbon sticker   that will definitely make up for all the fucked up shit the government puts them through,7,
71446,not surprised saw a guy in the va who used to jog through the base with his unitteam  not sure of the terminology   breathing in the smoke from one of these every day for 4 years he had some chronic lung condition we were working up  and said a couple of his buddies also have lung problems now otherwise perfectly healthy 40 years old  completely unnecessary illness due to stupidity andor apathy,6,
71447,http  wwwpublichealthvagovexposurescamplejeune for decades  the government knowingly allowed service members and their dependents to consume contaminated tap water fifteen diseases are recognized to have a direct relation to the contamination but many more are cropping up yet the government wo nt recognize those  yet   and they re filing motions to have claims tossed out based on statute of limitations  even though the government did nt even announce the contamination until over a decade after the wells were closed  this is nt just an agent orange or iraq war contamination where soldiers were exposed and have problems babies born at the base hospital hadhave an alarmingly high rate of birth defects but nothing is being done about it and the va continues to deny claims we ll just go ahead and add this one to the list,6,
71448,uhh i ve had a severe cough for 34 years now  since coming back from afghanistan  it ll get so bad  that i ll cough until i throw up  and then cough more  the va said it was normal i m sure they know what they re talking about i feel fine,6,
71449,i remember having to sit through a 2 hour briefing the first week i arrived in iraq  back in 2008 we were told that scientists verified that the burn pit on base was not a detriment to our health  then we had to sign forms when i returned stateside  there were quite a few reports of people having respiratory issues after returning from deployment  the va also denied that any illnesses were related to desert storm it took a long time for anyone other than veterans to admit that desert storm syndrome was a real thing  and then said veterans had to go through the gauntlet of proving their illnesses were related to their deployment,7,
71450,goddamn  it s unbelievable the way vets are treated shame,6,
71451,government does nt give a fuck about veterans,5,
71452,my 36yo buddy was just diagnosed with nonhodgkens lymphoma when he visited the va to do the paperwork they asked what bases he served at overseas  and literally had a list of diseases to reference per base just got a  yep  here it is probably from the burn pit  from the clerk thumbing down the list when he told me i was blown away  why is nt there any followup with soldiers who served at these bases    even a simple  you may want to get screened  when he returned from service would have given us some hope of getting in front of it it s incredibly irritating,5,
71453,the us lying about iraq and afghanistan  nah  never happen,7,
71454,do nt worry guys we ll take care of your medical needs when you come home oh wait,5,
71455,do nt forget area 51 they had burn pits like you would nt believe stealth materiels that had top secret components in them the poor guys that were exposed to all of this could nt even go for help  many died in secrecy  i know i was exposed to vaporized depleted uranium and who knows what else i have a sort of bet with my self that i ll die an early death,5,
71456,so  the dod did nt learn any lessons from previous burn pits  i mean  when you have to declassify area 51 because of workers health decline due to burn pits  you d think you d remember this shit is wrong,5,
71457, though he returned home safely in september 2009  he woke up one day a few months later with an inexplicable headache  numbness in his limbs and paralysis on one side of his body beau had suffered a mild stroke his health deteriorated  and he was diagnosed with brain cancer less than two years later  he died at the age of 46  holy fuck    fuck wars and politicians that start them,4,

71462,holy shit  my friend who was on the poop burning detail a bunch of times died of throat cancer earlier this year my first thought was it was the poop burning that did it  and i m concerned as well because i did my fair share of that as well,4,
71463,where we lived there was a burn pit that was nearby and the smoke would always float over to where we were  as of yet i dont have any symptoms but i do have a begine growth in my head  i have had it checked but i am paranoid that it could become bad ,4,
71464,little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did nt have to bother to actually lob chemicalbio weapons at us we d send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chembio bomb themselves  did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney,4,
71465,every time i allow myself a shred of regret for not enlisting  i remind myself that this kind of shit is what the us does to its soldiers fuck that i respect your service and all that  but fuck that shit,1,
71466,every goddamn war the military has to do something that exposes troops to dangerous chemicals,3,
71467,makes me wonder  i was at camp addertallil back in 2010  2011  what was i exposed to,3,
71468,i was in taji in 2011 2 people got cancer after our deployment  lots of people were having breathing problems we were right next to the tank graveyard and the burn pit was constantly going in our rush to shut down theater i ve gotten lung infections every year since then,3,

71477,that was one messy cakewalk,5,
71478,they should turn on the masters and their supporters,3,
71479,so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them,3,
71480,i thought iraq did nt have wmd s,4,
71481,be sure and vote gop they re the gift that keeps on giving   you give cancer to the army you have  not the army you wish you had,1,

71485,dude that deserve to be hung in the public square by their genitalia and beaten like a pinyata by roidedup baseball player,,
71487,hibner is especially surprised it happened in the gym  where the floor is just 15 years old  he said gt   i just think sometimes strange things happen and there s no explanation for the phenomena  even though it was a scary situation for players and parents  he said the girl who was injured is expected to be ready to play in the near future,7,
71488, impaled  sounds about as much of an overstatement as  got a splinter  would be an understatement in this case,7,
71489,gt   i  ve got a tournament here in two weeks  and i have every belief that we  ll be playing on this court that as well   hibner said  or you could put your petty shit on the backburner and ensure the safety of kids by paying for a structural analysis,4,
71490,scott walker will fix it if there s any money in it for him or his buddies  right  wisconsin  aka the louisiana of the north,3,
71491,they need to have an official inspection of the floor  not just parent volunteers,1,

71494,i grew up in a very small rural town  the high school i attended is part of a huge high school rivalry  one of the biggest in the nation hell its not uncommon for 20000 plus fans to attend the rivalry game  its so big it s held in a college stadium and has more people attend it then the college division 1 team any way i have friends and family members who are convinced the only way to go to college and make something out of yourself is to get there on a football scholarship one of my cousins young kid 16ish has already had a few concussions  his dad just chalks it up to part of the game and thinks parents need to stop being such  pussies  football is for men and if a boy ca nt take it he will never be a man sadly i think a lot of parents feel this way,9,
71495,smart move by him  if anything athletes should be focusing back on baseball guaranteed money and long contract,9,
71496,and it begins  the exodus away from our national infatuation with football,8,
71497,tbi survivor here and former football fanatic even had a denver broncos tat which has since been covered with some other nonsense anyway  brain injuries are obviously bad news as is the nfl s handling of them  i hope this becomes a trend,7,
71498,good for him  football does nt have to be a concussion prone sport it started as the american version of rugby  and evolved into the form we see today  and can just as properly evolve into something that is nt effectively a form of human sacrifice  part of how it evolved is the career of pop warner  the coach of the carlisle indian school he kept  how to put it  coaching like a lawyer  and coming up with clever ways to get an edge  that would then eb slapped down with rule changes  surely concussions justify rule changes too,7,
71499,i played football for 4 years in highschool started all 4 years i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fu,3,
71500,this is really just a click bait story no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers  i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is,5,
71501,who would let their son play american football,3,

71504,the student   i did nt want my life to end up as part of a shitty movie like concussion ,1,
71505,plot twist  he ca nt shoot,1,
71506,there are so many cool sports out there that have gone down in popularity that are cool out therewrestling for example,1,
71507,i hope he wears a big ass helmet all the time in order to avoid irony them baseballs travel fast,,
71509,i m going to assume that the project is getting a lot of input from people who were ignored for the last couple years andor late additions from people who just walked in the door  typical design by committee bullshit that happen,3,
71510,put the team behind the bay bridge project in charge it will become a guaranteed success   hopefully the s wo nt be necessary,1,

71512,ah the browndogle wasting tax payers money for years to come,,
71514,gt   the order is vague and because it imposes disproportionate  intrusive  and punitive measures against households and businesses with   no due process     did nt see that one coming,9,
71515,isps do nt actually want to spy on their customers like that it costs more money to put systems in place to do so and to maintain and operate those systems on top of that  it will only bring them bad press that could piss off customers  cox is basically saying  fuck you i m not taking a significant financial hit to spy on our customers so you can sue them and make money for yourself  they are doing the right thing  and the right thing also happens to be in their best business interest,9,
71516,good guy cox  not selling out their customers  they actually have super reliable internet no outages in any of my apartments so far,9,
71517,so to sum that up we do nt have to worry about any cox blocking,9,
71518,that s nice  but i m still going to run a vpn,8,
71519,all in all i ve been pretty happy with cox as an isp i ve used them in two different cities and it s always been reliable and fast i pay for 300mbps service and always get those speeds  usually higher almost no outages they re putting in 1gbs service in many of their cities right now  including mine  my biggest gripe with them is they have a soft data cap of 2 tb for my tier they do not enforce the caps at all but the fact that they exist means they are probably toying with the idea and there would be nothing to stop them from going evil since they are a monopoly like every other major isp it s like a benevolent dictatorship  http  wwwspeedtestnetmyresult5089441276 that s with a netflix stream going on in another room right now,9,
71520,this must be a new thing many a year s ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did nt even know what that was  none of us knew what that even was and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi,7,
71521,i ve been really happy with cox for an isp both personally and professionally here in okc personally  out of nowhere they bumped my at home connection from 15mbit to 100mbit and my bill  went down  30  all out of nowhere  without me saying a word internet is always up  not throttled  and they have decent support if it s needed  professionally at my job i ran in ip phone deployment with them for our main office  3 satellite offices they were there 100  of the way i have personal names and numbers to call in the event of issues outside of the scope of my support as the companies it admin  and when we ve needed someone on site to climb a pole for instance their longest response time was 45 minutes  i know this sounds like rhailcorporate but the fact is out of all the isps i ve had  comcast  qwest  charter  etc  they ve been the best that s not saying they should nt and could nt be better  but they re angels next to the others  in fact they proactively contact me at work every once and awhile to check on things which i greatly appreciate and they bring us cookies every month yes  our isp brings yes cookies no  we re not a big company 9 employees they re just nice,8,
71522,basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum,8,
71523,i used to work for cox in the field and inside cox did have a department that would monitor massive down loading and uploading but they did away with it shortly after i got there  within a year cox ca nt afford to lose customers right now so it s no surprise they are nt allowing this if they did then they would go out of business from customer loss i survived their huge layoff and realignment,5,
71524,this is nothing new from cox i have had cox internet for over 10 years and worked for them a few years ago they have always had this attitude toward it s customers the customer pays for internet access  cox provides internet access they do nt even enforce data caps  at least in oklahoma   i have received a few emails due to using so much data suggesting that i switch to a business plan to maximize my speed  but have never been charged extra or cut off due to exceeding a data cap,7,
71525,gt  last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers  what the actual fucking fuck,6,
71526,as a customer this is the first good thing i ve ever heard from cox,4,
71527,not true from my experience,3,
71528,i ve had them as an isp for several years and they re excellent i did have one month where i went over my allowed bandwidth limit  300 gb on a 50 mbps down plan   and all i got was an email saying  do nt do that again   no throttling or charges or anything on 100 mbps down plan right now and i usually get 110 at least they re great  come out to me if i m having internet trouble that s not solved by online support  etc pretty good basically  i love cox and i m very satisfied with how much i get,3,
71529,unrelated but i could nt stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox,3,
71530,i am a proud supporter of cox,3,
71531,where are all the penis jokes,3,
71532,not as nice as it sounds if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do nt catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status  eg that they do nt have any liabilityresponsibility for what people use their pipe for   most carriers are  very  vested in not being the internet police,3,
71533,i m guessing that if they had a way to monetize it and add to the bottom line  they d be very supportive,3,
71534,when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battl,5,
71535,cox is actually a familyowned business one of the major interest holders is a 96 year old woman who inherited from her father  she had been running it with her sister until her death in 2007   i happen to think they re one of the leastshady isp and cable providers out there  they also own the travel channel  which is a pretty great channel,5,
71536,i thought this was talking about jesse cox,4,
71537,i work for cox corporate in a startup tech company  and this makes me so happy  btw  they re just as decent an employer as they are an isp compan,3,
71538,cox is spying like a champ  rest assured you have to be quite innocent or high on meth to think they have nt supplied info to big brother and his little brothers  and will not in the future,3,
71539,yells loudly  i will not    whispers  if you need me too,1,
71540,on that headline alone  i thought jessie cox was asked to spy on his youtube subs  was very confused for a little bit,1,
71541,i knew he was my favorite eagl,1,
71542,well that s one bit of good news from cox now if they d stop raising my rates every few months,1,
71543,damn  i wish i had cox i have time warner and i m on my 3rd notice to stop torrenting i do nt know if they ll actually pull the plug  they re charging me out the ass already since they re the only provider in my area,1,
71544,fuck yea cox   comcast   1  co,1,
71545,cox  and to some extent time warner  are cable companies all cable companies fuck you in the ass  these two have the decency to spit on it first i at the very least get what i pay for with both of them,1,
71546,they sent me a few emails in the past  so i got a vpn i will still use it  but good on cox for not being dickbags,1,
71547,they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jone,1,
71548,i had cox for 3 years service was good  and over that 3 years  doubled my download speeds twice no extra cost upload was still garbage  but hey 10015 internet for  65 a month was still pretty killer i have 7575 fios now,1,
71549,almost every single person in my area that has gone to atamp  t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable  they have some shit with them but it s far less shit than others,1,
71550,they re my isp and even though they re the only isp in my city besides att and verizon  they ve been awesome,1,
71551,the shifting of blame to continue  going after johns and endusers has never worked,1,
71552,ho yeah  today is a good day to have cox  teehee,1,
71553,horseshit they cut off our internet because someone was downloading something like a year ago they re the best isp i ve ever used  but they absolutely do exactly what the mpaa et al want,1,
71554,between cox and cable one in both places i live  i actually like our midwest internet providers i feel bad for people getting rammed by twc and comcast we ve paid  45 for 100mbps for several years  which sounds way better than the horror stories i hear from you guys,1,
71555,cause they love internet freedom  or because it costs an extra 30 cents to have an extra indian screen data at the call center for 70 an hour,1,
71556,protected pirate plan from cox   7500month,1,

71567,i hope they get it right and protest the us department of education if student loans are your issue  go straight to the source of your ills ironically enough  the only way to end student debt is to scale down and eventually eliminate the student loan program,7,
71568, protesters lose jobs for not showing up to work  arrested for nonpayment,7,
71569,i see payday loans taking this route soon,5,
71570,did nt we get rid of debtor s prisons  i m confuse,4,
71571,i believe this happened as i heard this story from other news sources  but some info had to be left out or missing in the us if you owe money on a debt the personcompany has seven years to collect if they do nt the debt disappears if they take you to court and get a judgement they have ten years to collect and it can be renewed for ten more years the only way he could be arrested is if the loan company took him to court  won a judgement and then took further action to force the debtor to court this would not be something to come out of the blue,3,
71572,more from the professional  victim class  i guess you need something to do in between police shootings and sanders rallies,4,
71574,at least the guy was honest,4,

71583,how many hellfire missiles would that buy,8,
71584,this is a great thing people who are bashing him do not make much sense the monuments in dc are one of the united states  greatest treasures  and likewise they cost a lot to maintain let alone refurbish they are a public venue that is traversed by millions and are awesome to each person that visits  this guy decided to use some of his money to give back and better public places that reside in our nation capital and some see him as an asshole  it is one thing to be bitter about not having that kind of money  it is another thing to get pissed when someone with money gives back,7,
71585,its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring,3,
71586,good for him i remember the lincoln memorial being one of my more favorite monuments i d like to take my son there some day  so it s nice to see it will be upgraded and fixed up  to all the naysayers and negative commenters  fuck you,5,

71591,i think it s great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about what i do nt like is that there should nt even be an issue with funding for our monuments,4,
71592,if we re committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i m all for it,1,
71593,i wonder how many huge donations like this  maybe smaller  in the hundreds of thousands  have been made for national monuments pretty awesome someone did this wo reading the article  i have to imagine there s a good amount of rigmarole on the donor s end to ensure the donation goes to where the donor actually wanted govt accountability on any level in the us seems kind of weak lately,1,

71603,i certainly appreciate what david has done here but  with all due respect to david  most americans would rather not see financial industry groups  like the carlyle group  suck economic resources out ofaway from most americans instead  we d prefer to pay for these efforts through widespread  robust economic opportunities and the tax contributions they make possible millions of americans and this nation have been greatly diminished as a result of the business activities of groups  like the carlyle group  over several decades  because of grotesque incomewealth inequality  the odds of seeing successful businesspeople like david rubinstein are greatly diminished he only got where he was because of the social ladder that used to exist in this nation,,
71604,how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions,,

71685,i have spent some time among the government arab workers of these nations and i have no pity for the trials that lie ahead of them in the real world  they wielded their unearned wealth with a brash arrogance  putting themselves above other races with a disgusting assumption that they were somehow favored by god  and therefore inherently better than others in fact  it was equally distasteful for them when an american did  not  wield their racenationality with a pompous arrogance because this undermined their own claim to legitimacy  this was not some single unpleasant person i dealt with it was the overwhelming majority out of 100 citizens  there were maybe 5 people who had enough wisdom and openmindedness to question such an absurd world view  for example  on a hot day i was supervising pakistani and indian workers doing our manual labor for us  as it would have been unbecoming for an arab and an american to be doing manual labor i took some of our cold water bottles we had in our cooler and offered them to the workers  but was stopped by one of the head guys  do nt do that   he warned me shaking his head his message was clear  he did nt want the workers to get used to that treatment  i witnessed minorities berated and even physically accosted at times only americans and british were spared from the cruel racism that pervades the arab world it seeps into your daily life and if you live in it long enough you even start to internalize it ugh  i am looking forward to the cold splash of reality to wash over that region and wake many of those intolerant people up from their slumber,7,

71689,have done some research in saudi echoing similar things everybody wants government jobs  but the government is trying to push private sector employment  so you end up with many saudis who do nt do anything showing up on payrolls and there s a somewhat true perception that most companies would prefer to hire foreigners  who will work harder  over citizens  not sure what the longterm solution is for the employment problems  but crashing oil revenue is definitely going to make things worse will be interesting to see if government is going to start shrinking public sector employment more heavily,5,

71727,arizona   republican   legislators want to subvert the will of the people ftf,7,
71728,sounds reasonable to me  more easily  is such a loaded headline current law states ballot measures need 34th of both chambers of legislature to overturn ballot measures no matter how narrowly they pass mesnard wants to amend the law so that the amount needed to overturn is proportional to the margin the measure passed  people want to sit here and think this is some republican ploy on the grounds of marijuana measures  but what happens if some sleazy right wing john kavanagh inspired measure gets through at 51   there are certainly 15 az senators who ll support it and thus it ca nt be changed  this bill gives parity to both sides of the aisle,,

71732,from what i ve read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops it looks like the taser use was justified sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca nt be deescalated otherwise  has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died,6,
71733,this is unacceptable tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are nt,7,
71734,he died 5 days later at a different hospital  clickbait headline i m sure we ll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death,6,

71766,there s a great documentary on netflix called  high profits  about a business in breckenridge  co right before full legalization took effect  one of the big issues was exactly this only being able to do business in cash from payroll to paying city taxes they had  120k in cash they had to just walk into the front of the city building with and that was just the first month alone  some of the people that make the drops to the shops are walking out with  10k in their pockets and no security at all it s terrifying,8,

71773,this war on cash is such bullshit  people carried cash until 12 years ago and it was perfectly fine  now they are trying to restrict flying with cash  purchasing with cash  seizing cash   the only problem is that the money is due on one day  they need to have the tax office take payment on any day of the week  so it s stacked,6,
71774,i wonder how negative interest rates  if implemented  would effect the marijuana business these value of the business would probably increase as they had large sums of cash on hand their credit worthiness would increase because they had something of value  cash  but they would be penalized for depositing that cash according to the recent imf working paper i wonder if they would become attractive targets for some banks to help capitalize their weak balance sheets,3,

71805,good for him  football does nt have to be a concussion prone sport it started as the american version of rugby  and evolved into the form we see today  and can just as properly evolve into something that is nt effectively a form of human sacrifice  part of how it evolved is the career of pop warner  the coach of the carlisle indian school he kept  how to put it  coaching like a lawyer  and coming up with clever ways to get an edge  that would then eb slapped down with rule changes  surely concussions justify rule changes too,7,
71806,i played football for 4 years in highschool started all 4 years i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fu,3,

71824,comcast   so what  it s not like you can leave me,9,
71825,comcast is used to pissing people off they wo nt give a fuck,9,
71826,you could probably just sticky this post  have no link from it or replies available that is how permanent of an issue this is,9,
71827,we want google fiber and we want it now,9,
71828,if a telephone company has this large a problem  they have to meet with the fcc and show cause most likely there would also be a hefty fine but  not cable networks because they are deemed nonessential,7,
71829,not news to me i have a 3 hour outage at least once a month with comcast a 1020 minute outage daily around 56 am  and at least 34 10 minute outages sprinkled throughout the week  i know this because 2 out of every 5 or 6 dvr recorded shows are fucked up during the middle   absolutely awful i live in a moderate city  too  so it s not like i m in the middle of fucking nowhere,7,
71830,and then they wonder why people are ready to go to google fibe,7,
71831,loss of internet and television access for 3 days would cause mass panic and riot,8,
71832,my bad people i went over my 300gb and used way too much of an infinite resource,7,
71833,wow  17k outages nationwide for as much as 3 hours  obama needs to step in and fix this for sure ,9,
71834,gt  across us i bet i could find thousands who are angry at comcast  in my town alone ,5,
71835,i m fully expecting to get downvoted to hell here  but what the heck  i m not particularly fond of comcast  but unless i missed something here  which is entirely possible   this does nt actually sound like it was particularly horrific for people in general it sounds like a very small fraction of their nationwide customer base  had an outage of parts of their service for about 3 or 4 hours  not even all of their service  but things like they could nt access their hd channels  or their internet did nt work for a few hours  i understand for businesses  an internet outage can be a big deal  so some outrage on their part would be justified  but for the general consumer  come on  get a grip go read a book for a while  or go outside for a bit  or  gasp  go do something with your family  i m just not getting what the huge deal was here  what am i missing,7,
71836,i was part of the outage did nt have internet and only had access to about 8 sd channels i ll be honest  3 hours where i have to use my phone for internetsi could nt care less had to go out and shovel anyway  edit  couldgt  could n,7,
71837,not a fan of comcast  but with this outage they probably still provide 9999  uptime bunch of whiners  yes  i work in it,6,
71838,i like how this is news in this country,7,
71839,comcast angers me even without outages,7,
71840,the words  anger  and  comcast  come up often,4,
71841,there needs to be legally mandated uptime and speed requirements  95  of the time your connection must reach the  advertised  speed  no more  up to xmbps  allowed  and 99  of the time it must reach 14 of that speed if this is nt met then customers must be completely refunded for that month,4,
71842,is anyone else still completely fucking down  just everything  been down for 15 hours here,4,
71843,quote from the article   comcast has more than 27 million customers  and 89000 of those are new cable subscribers the company signed on last quarter that was its best performance in eight years  correct me if i m wrong but are nt there 2 choices for most people  sign up with comcast or do nt have high speed internet  it s like bragging because people choose to eat food from the only supplier rather than starve to death,4,
71844,comcast seems to be an isp that people love to hate  charter got so bad for so many years that i loved to hate them in all honesty  the past three to four years or so they have been great,7,
71845,customer service replied   working as intended,3,
71846,i ve had comcast xfinity for almost 2 years now and i ve never had an issue,5,
71847,fun story i was at a friend s place watching the superbowl in denver comcast blacked out cbs with 1 minute 26 seconds left on the clock in second quarter  and service was nt restored till about 15 seconds before 3rd quarter kicked off  idk how widespread this was but lots of denverites did nt get to see the super bowl halftime show i d imagine comcast would lose a lot of money if their advertisers paid to have a certain amount of views and one of the biggest markets  since denver was participating in the super bowl  cut out all views during the entire halftime show idk how their whole contract with that stuff goes though  i hear i did nt miss much though,1,
71848,that s what happens things go out sometimes,3,
71849,friend of mine called to ask why he couldnt connect  he obviously cant check if there are outages in his neighborhood without the internet  he calls them and they offer to send a tech to his house for like  80  they didnt tell him the price  but you know itd be up there  he spends an hour checking all his connections  digging through paperwork to find his modem settings page  finally calls back about 8hrs later hoping to talk to someone else and theyre like   oh yeah  there s an outage in your area   idiots,1,
71850,when i called  i was disconnected 3 times this is great customer nonservice beside the lack of tv thanks comcast for helping me make my change from you  easier,1,
71851,it s nothing new that comcast absolutely sucks,1,
71852,when you deal with technology  there is only one thing i can guarantee you it will get down at the worst possible time,1,
71853, compact angers thousands across the us for something other than just being comcast for once  ftf,1,
71854,they just put a data cap on my home internet how fucked is that  pretty fucked if you ask me,1,
71855,what is the most troubling about comcast is that when there is an outtage  it doesnt effect just a small region  but instead downs multiple states that seems so rediculous,1,
71856,once they fix the outage you re left with  comcast anger thousands across us,1,
71857,now only 1000 years to lrrr ruler of the planet omicron persei 8 comes to destroy earth,1,
71858,it s not like we re losing  that  much more bandwidth it s only like 20 megs less than what we had before which was only 80 megs less than what we re paying for,1,
71859,so  i had to get comcast recently because i moved and noticed something weird about my bill the letter in the mail has a different due date than the due date that shows up on the online account just saying folks make sure to pay 2 days before your date at least,1,
71860,just having comcast in general makes them angry,1,
71861, nsfw how comcast really feels   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  kmcny_pixdw,1,
71862,once in a while fios is out for a few hours hard to get too pissed  these things do happen i do nt think comcast needs an outage to be hated honestly though for me they were a decent provider  i never had a single issue with them except for the occasional outage,1,
71863,wow now that s comcastic,1,
71864,it was out for like 3 hours jesus christ,1,
71865,my comcast service  for the first time in years  has actually been pretty good lately but i d like to pay less  so i m rooting for google fiber to come to boston simply so i can reap the benefits of competition  i mean  that s what we really want  right  we do nt want yet another monopoly  no matter how  altruistic  we think google will be  we want the existing monopolies to be forced into providing quality service for a reasonable price  along with other choices,1,
71866,it probably still worked better than my centurylink ds,1,
71867,comcast s response   it pays the restoration fee  or else it gets the hose again,1,
71868,my case  as in many others  boils down to this  you can pay triple the amount for the same throughput speeds or you can curse comcast and wait for google fiber,1,
71869,at the same time  i would nt want to be on the other end and get screamed at from 10k  people experiencing the outage i just went out instead of being at home it s aggregating that it happens so often  at the same time there are other things to d,1,
71870,they should just switch providers if they are nt satisfied  see what i did there ,1,
71871,after this comcast will just be turning off their services everywhere after all  they could save a ton of money that way,1,
71872,for comcast  it was tuesday,1,
71873,spread your cheeks  most of you wo nt even complain or ask for a billing credit,1,
71874,title should just be  comcast angers thousands across us   i fucking hate comcast with every fiber of my being  reasons  i  paying top dollar for slow as shit internet  ii  a modemrouter combo that broadcasts an unsecured public network from your home which has to be manually deactivated  iib  said modem has to be forced reset once a week  and doing so undoes the manual changes you made to get rid of the second network  iii  arbitrary data caps  iv  live television that freezes  v  ondemand that works infrequently  and turns into minecraft porn when it crashes  vi  customer  service  that refuses to listen to what your problem is  but instead tries to upsell you on a more advanced package  one of my dreams is to live long enough to see this shit stain regional monoploy of a company implode upon itself  or be run straight into the fucking grave by google fiber,1,
71875,i always laugh at this shit until i remember i m with twc  the   second   worst rated isp in america,1,

71904,for those of you incapable of rtfa before making racist comments  the bride and groom are actors hired by a charity to raise awareness and the 37000day statistic refers to child marriages estimated worldwide not specifically in this local area,9,
71905,gt  nearly 15 million girls  some as young as eight or nine so  some as young as eight,9,
71906,37000 child marriages every day  if that s the case why are these people shocked  surely they must see these pedo photoshoots on the reg,9,
71907,these statistics seem unreliable estimated 12 billion new child marriages by 2050  even taking the 37000 a day estimate at face value that would only get you to 500 million by 2050  i mean seriously  assuming population growth rates remain unchanged  unlikely as the rate is slowing significantly  there will only be  47 billion women born under the age of 8 by 2050 is it truly believable that a quarter of women born in the next 34 years are going to be placed into a child marriage,8,

71942,from the regressive left s perspective  by censoring and silencing opposing opinions  especially those from sources merely  perceived  as not being   progressive   regressive enough  they are allowing for  traditionally oppressed groups  to   be used as a mouthpiece that ca nt be challenged because of cries of racism   speak  just as long as they say the correct    progressive   regressive things ,,

71999,from  government  s memorandum in support of its motion for pretrial detention   http  wwwscribdcomdoc29947153421616doc4usavclivenbundyusadetentionmemorandumforclivenbundy  gt  bundy is lawless and violent he does not recognize federal courts  claiming they are illegitimate  does not recognize federal law  refuses to obey federal court orders  has already used force and violence against federal law enforcement officers while they were enforcing federal court orders  nearly causing catastrophic loss of life or injury to others he has pledged to do so again in the future to keep federal law enforcement officers from enforcing the law against him as of the date of this hearing  he continues to violate federal court orders and continues to possess the proceeds of his illegal activities  gt  gt  bundy is currently charged with crimes of violence including using and brandishing firearms in connection with crimes of violence under title 18  united states code  section 924  c   as such  the bail reform act presumes that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that will ensure the safety of the community 18 usc  3142  e   3   b   here  no evidence has been adduced during the investigation of the instant charges that even remotely hints at a rebuttal to that presumption in fact  all the evidence suggests that bundy will continue to act lawlessly  will not abide by court orders  and will use violence to ensure that federal laws are not enforced as to him,8,
72000, bundy asked for a courtappointed attorney at his first hearing last week  still living off govt handouts i see,8,
72001,gt  bundy   his  attorney said  would go to court in nevada if ordered to do so   right  sure i mean  it s not like he s ever defied the government before  and he  totally  recognises it s legitimacy  gt  but judge stewart said if bundy was released   i  m guessing that  s the last we  ll ever see of mr bundy  a wise and perspicacious judge,9,
72002, daughterinlaw briana bundy said tuesday that a federal judge in oregon should let the 69yearold live at home while he awaits trial  sure that s an excellent suggestion i would further suggest that the judge prepare a lunch of peanut butter sandwiches with home made raspberry jam and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies for mr bundy each day,8,
72003,gt  the judge said bundy  69  is a flight risk and a danger to the community in the bail hearing tuesday afternoon in downtown portland i mean i ca nt really find a reason not to agree with that a 69 year old who does nt believe he s beholden to the law is as dangerous as a 29 year old who does nt believe he s beholden to the law,8,
72004,they are just misunderstood they did this for free sex toys,7,
72005,not sure he was the worst member of ya llquaida  http  mwashingtontimescomnews2014apr15formersheriffwillingletwifedaughterdiefron,6,
72006,hope he gets the  negros  there to hear his theory or their culture and living style,1,
72007,the man is a wellmeaning but ideologically obsessed idiot the government has handled this clusterfuck extremely well  and i am not one to say that lightly,6,
72008,it s important for the government to provide a consistent and cohesive narrative if they are to help squash future acts of rebellion cliven bundy and his ilk are lawless  violent  redneck anarchists and none of the things they protested had any validity whatsoever,5,
72009,good  this arrest and trial has been delayed for too long,7,
72010,given his history  bundy is as dangerous as a monkey with a straightrazor,4,
72011,where is the groundswell of the righteously indignant right wing militia that was supposed to come to his aid,1,
72012,mmmmmm i need some of the bundy range fed beef i hope the feds seize it all soon and put it up for sale,1,
72013,so anyone knows how long a trial like this could last,1,
72014,yalqueda finally facing justice,1,
72015,well then that s that,1,
72016,does this mean that harry reid s son s land deal can finally go through,,
72018,also cars bad guys use those a lot and the internet also food,9,
72019,casinos would lobby against it a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small it would fit in a plastic shopping bag a million dollars in small bills is massive  there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash,8,
72020,how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 ,9,
72021,yeah if my big illegal bag of money was heavier  i d totally reconsider all the crime i do to obtain large bags of money it just would nt be worth the hassle,7,
72022,thank you but fuck no it s bad enough carrying around 100s to go buy cars amp  bikes on craigslist  now you want me to carry boxes of 20s   the  100 has plenty of legitimate uses  no need to make things harder for the 999  of the population that s lawabiding,9,
72023,thats why they got rid of the  500 billand it didnt work so well,8,
72024,keep marijuana and cocaine illegal  it s the 100 dollar bills that are the problem,7,
72025,i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four  5000 bills instead of two  10000 was too taxing better go straight,8,
72026,clearly  100 bills are the problem,7,
72027,people still listen to larry summers  i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008 or does cnn still think repealing glasssteagall was a good idea,7,
72028,it s not about stopping criminals it s about controlling peoples money with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically this is what done in europe to prevent  tax fraud ,7,
72029,might aswell remove any chemicals or equipment in the world that can make drugs aswell larry summers idea is stupid  it would nt just hurt criminals  it would hurt the innocent people aswell,7,
72030,in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the  100 bill it is very popular outside the us,5,
72031,the new blue  100 bills are too cool to replace,5,
72032,80  of the money supply being in  100 bills is the key statement this would likely be the first  and easiest  step to killing paper currency this is one of the initial hurdles to overcome  because they do nt give a fuck about it being tough on criminals  come on  when looking to implement negative interest rates,8,
72033,the thing about secondary labor markets  drugs  gambling  prostitution  etc  is that prohibition is what causes the main problems related to them these are black markets that will always have demand as long as the activities are forced underground by punitive policy  and that demand will always find a way around obstacles  making life marginally more difficult for the suppliers is only doing to make the products more dangerous  not less desirable,5,
72034,that is the most twisted logic   no more  100 bills  guess i ll stop dealing crack,5,
72035,okay larry last time we listened to you we deregulated the banks in 1999 nah larry  i m not gon na listen to you,5,
72036,make it illegal for poor people to ever have cash money so that you can freeze their accounts when their name shows up on the noflylist  eh  they already ca nt buy a car in cash without the dealership informing on them to the feds,6,
72037,how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds   ,4,
72038,i urge everybody here to watch inside job  it will shock you on how thoroughly corrupt this dude is  along with his buddies on wall street washington now he wants the gov to ban the  100 because of nirp  he does nt give a fuck about criminals using those or tax evasions do not listen to what this turd says,4,
72039,attention  we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash  except pennies   cash is privacy and should be a basic right,1,
72040,i wonder what larry would think about paul krugman s onetime pet project  the  trilliondollar coin   http  krugmanblogsnytimescom20130107bereadytomintthatcoin  _r  0 ,5,
72041,is something going on with all the major currencies  i saw a similar story about the euro notes too  http  wwwdailymailcoukwiresreutersarticle3448066ecbconsidersscrapping500euronotehtml also http  wwwdailymailcouknewsarticle3437590banksurgedban50notesbidendcashhandculturehelprecoupbillionstaxtreasuryhtml all these stories within a week of each other  i would nt be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency,3,
72042,currently in colorado  hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash,3,
72043,scrap larry summers  and get rid of a criminal,3,
72044,the only relevance to crime is the idea itself scam to grab more control of your money  bankster shenanigans do nt fall for it,3,
72045,the banks love this this means less people holding cash and more money that they can use to fuck us over remember folks  the rules are changing so that the money on deposit with banks is legally not yours if there s a bank failure  your money will be used to bail out the banks  the move is simply an extension of the war on cash,3,
72046,the fed stopped printing any bills higher than  100 in 1945 they began destroying the larger denominations actively in 1969  100 in 1945 is equivalent to  1300 today adjusting for inflation frankly they should be talking about issuing a  200 and  500 bill  if not also a  1000 bill,3,
72047,larry summers should be in prison  he is one of the architects of the 2008 collapse he also was instrumental in the repeal of glasssteagall the world would be better off without this fool and his dangerous ideas  http  wwwsourcewatchorgindexphp  title  larry_summer,3,
72048,does larry mean wall st criminals  of course not  white male entitlement it s what larry is all about unfortunately obama was dumb enough to bring summers into his administration where he flailed about  lamely attempting to cover upmake excuses as to why the theater burned down in 2008 with the financial  masters of the universe  still inside  larry proved his overall dumbness by predicting 2011 would be  recovery summer   based on nothing  no evidence just his  expert  opinion  there was no recovery in 2011,3,
72049,bring back the  500 and  1000 dollar bills dammit,3,
72050,larry summers  ladies and gentlemen one of the masterminds of financial deregulation is now proposing another hair brained idea summers  go clone yourself so you can go fuck yourself,3,
72051,just legalize crime everybody wins,3,
72052,fuk this illuminati puppe,4,
72053,the bulk of the value of cash in circulation is from  100 s get rid of cash and the fed can do any crazy policy it wants this is a necessary step towards negative interest rates nobody believes the government gives two shits about money laundering  florida real estate laws and hsbc getting zero criminal charges shows that is not the case,3,
72054,banksters do nt even use cash oh wait you re talking about the little criminals carry on,4,
72055,another attempt by the wealthy to outlaw cash our money is nt our money  according to the elite,5,
72056,then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination ,3,
72057,scrap the two  the single  the penny  half dollar and nickel instead,3,
72058,scrap the drugs too  make them illegal  oh wait,1,
72059,but they just click buttons on a computer and create and move money around  wait  what,1,
72060,than how will our government and cia function,1,
72061,interning theory main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks,1,
72062,singapore has had the 10000 singapore dollar bill for some time it is still legal tender  but is going to be phased out slowly old notes will not be replaced  this is a calculated strategy by the sg government to comply with international counterterrorism and anti money laundering efforts  but minimising their own vulnerability to regulatory arbitrage,1,
72063,is nt the  100 bill the staple of american foreign trade  i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like  interestfree  loans  though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ,1,
72064,politicians do nt use  100s so how could it harm criminals,1,
72065,what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then,1,
72066,gt  the  100 bill is actually the second most common us bill in circulation  behind the  1 bill  gt  nearly 80  of the  14 trillion of us currency in circulation is in  100 bills much of it is held outside the united states  i m no math magician  but this does nt seem to fit,1,
72067,yeah  just watch  they will scrap it right down to the 20  anyone who wants to make largeish purchases will have to use electronic accounts that can be tracked  oh yeah   because crime  not  because government needs to track your every move,1,
72068,this is one of those ideas that seems silly at first but the more you think of it  the more it makes some sense,1,
72069,this is stupid  criminals will make due with what ever currency there is  they do nt fucking care and any one who thinks otherwise is a desk jocky looking for something to do,1,
72070,switch to all coins while you re at it if  100 weighed an ounce   1600 would weigh a pound  1 mil would weigh 625 lbs,1,
72071,larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone,1,
72072,how would this effect the bitcoin market,1,
72073,this is about getting rid of cash  not making life tougher for criminals that way  when the fed institutes negative interest rates  you the lowly consumer will be forced to spend your savings to avoid being charged for saving,1,
72074,funny thing  today also the eu central bank ceo emanuele prodi announced that 500 euro bills are to be outphased for the same reason apparently american criminals manage to launder money with a bill that s 6 times less in value  is nt this just a global banking scheme to rob us the power over our own money,1,
72075,yes those evil people in government would love to get rid of cash and make everyone just use electronic money because then  the bank has your money and you only have an iou which they may  or may not  pay you back in the future  look at cyprus in 2013 where people did nt get their full deposited funds back because of the financial crisis  also they can charge you negative interest rateswhich means you have to pay for the bank to hold your funds  and of course if the govt has your money  then they have a great deal more power over you in deciding whether they should be nice and give it back to you or not  this is another reason why bitcoin is good  although they will ban that long before they ban cash,1,
72076,now  whatchall wan na do  wan na be ballers  shotcallers  brawlers  who be dippin in the benz wit tha spawlers,,
72077,hmm sounds like portable bitcoin exchange devices would be cool carry a bitcoin wallet in a little  5 raspberry pilike thing with an lcd display  hook it up to another  punch in transfer codes  both devices show  are you sure   both people hit yes  see the verification displayed  and bill sizes become irrelevant and everybody can keep negotiating with cash when buying motorcycles off craigslist no matter what these control freak asshats try to pull,,
72078,you can still buy silver and gold anonymously  and cash out up to  1500 worth at one time with no tax penalty,,
72079,but  but  how will weezy and drizzy write raps now if they ca nt talk about dem big faces,,
72081, every  prepackaged shredded cheese has it it s the most common anticlumping agent used around the world the argument is that the labels said 100  cheese,9,
72082,labels should be accurate end of story if the product inside does not match the label ingredients  it is fraud and should be prosecuted as such,8,
72083,that s why you buy a little wedge of parm and use a microplane grater on it to shave cheese onto your pasta the wedge lasts a very long time  and in the end it s cheaper than the nasty jars,7,
72084,cellulose is the actual substance you ll find it in all pregrated cheeses these guys were just busted putting too much in to save    lettuce is also made of cellulose where commercial outfits get it for cheese  i guess could be just about any plant judged edible  including  sure  trees  also who knows what kind of cheese you re supposedly getting much nicer to get a hunk of the real stuff and a crank grater  my knuckles hate box graters with a passion ,8,
72085,so my penne has wood,7,
72086,so the correct labeling is 92  cheese and 8  wood filler  i think that s right,6,
72087,solution  buy your parmesan  domestic or real  and grate it yourself tastes better too if you re really lazy  grate it and freeze until you need it,7,
72088,damn were becoming like china  next will have faked food,6,

72094,hmm i am pretty sure i misread that title,1,
72095,it s cheaper by the chunk anyways,1,
72096,similar to olive oil  most parmesan cheese is nt even parmesan cheese,1,
72097,my parents always called it cardboard chees,1,
72098,it still taste oh so goooooooood,1,
72099,if it tastes good  i do nt care,1,
72100,pene means weiner in spanish that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood,1,
72101,maybe they are just trying to get people to eat a whole door over the course of a year,1,
72102,just buy the blockwedge and grate your own,1,
72103,gt  she faces up to a year in prison  so  what re you in for blondie    just beat me up and get it over with,1,
72104,cellulose is indeed an anti clumping agent if they use more and it does not change taste  i am ok with it at least it has less calories  ,,
72105,if you buy preshredded or grated cheese  you deserve to eat wood,,

72160,yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country,4,

72193,i m 100  fine with this i ca nt believe they need apple though unless they want everything done legally,1,
72195,this makes sense a lot of people in science fields relating to cancer formation  such as radiology and medicinal biology  are of the opinion that most cancerous tumors are actually quietly killed by the body before they can reach critical mass to defend themselves  and the ones that prove dangerous are the ones that either do nt register to t cells or which grow too quickly to be snuffed to simplify  the reasons for this are simple  not everyone dies from cancer  and everyone gets exposed to carcinogens given the rate of mutation  the influence of radiation  the amount of background radiation  etc  that everyone is unavoidably exposed to  we should all develop tumors if there is a true casual relationship if you simply say that the body is helpless against them naturally  we would all die from cancer the body  must  be defending itself from them given that we do nt  in fact  it s basically accepted as scientific truth cancer is nt simply the presence of cancerous tumors  it s the presence of cancerous tumors that have the right surrounding cells  in the right quantity  that do nt die from immune system intervention and which have favorable growth conditions most small tumors simply do nt have the right conditions  and die studies have confirmed that the ones that register as cancer are a subset of all tumors that might form  because this subset avoids the usual limiting factors  so  going back to the article  this is simply taking the bodies natural process for fighting tumors and guiding it to specific cancers it might normally miss and saying  go get it   then praying you did nt just kill the poor sap with his now manically overenthusiastic immune system,6,
72196,gt  the treatment involves removing the tcells from patients  tagging them with  receptor  molecules that target cancer  and putting them back into the body in an infusionthe targeting molecules  known as chimeric antigen receptors or cars  came from specially bred genetically engineered mice   gt  in one study  94 percent of participants suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia  all  said their symptoms vanished completely after they were treated with the modified blood cells  known as tcells  it looks like this could be a very  very big deal i m surprised that  as of this comment  this post is not getting much attention,7,
72197,now they just need to find a way to reverse liver cirrhosis and i can live forever,1,
72198,this is a breakthrough right up until the pharmaceutical companies buy the process and tuck it away forever  there s no money to be made in curing a disease,1,
72199,i m rather hopeful that we ll be able to cure most cancers within the next 20 years or so  and hopefully before that we ll have something that wo nt cure it but will reliably halt cancer so that a patient can just wait for the actual cure to be found  as with we do with hiv i believe  maybe i m being too optimistic  but you got ta be optimistic about something in this miserable world,1,

72224,arizona   republican   legislators want to subvert the will of the people ftf,7,
72225,sounds reasonable to me  more easily  is such a loaded headline current law states ballot measures need 34th of both chambers of legislature to overturn ballot measures no matter how narrowly they pass mesnard wants to amend the law so that the amount needed to overturn is proportional to the margin the measure passed  people want to sit here and think this is some republican ploy on the grounds of marijuana measures  but what happens if some sleazy right wing john kavanagh inspired measure gets through at 51   there are certainly 15 az senators who ll support it and thus it ca nt be changed  this bill gives parity to both sides of the aisle,,
72227,tl  dr  apple has to provide the means to extract encrypted data from the device fbi will then try to decrypt it  i assume by brute force  would would be easy for a 4digit pin   the interesting part is that the device is owned by farook s employer  the san bernardino county department of public health had they been following proper device protocol  they would already have administrator access to it  this was literally government property used for terrorism  and now unsearchable not due to the  encryption  boogeyman but their own ineptitude,7,
72228,gt  the judge ruled tuesday that the cupertinobased company had to provide  reasonable technical assistance  to the government in recovering data from the iphone 5c  including bypassing the autoerase function and allowing investigators to submit an unlimited number of passwords in their attempts to unlock the phone apple has five days to respond to the court if it believes that compliance would be  unreasonably burdensome  so it sounds like the government does nt think apple can bypass it for them  just make it easier for them to brute force i bet judge s ruling will hold up  too,4,
72229,i have this hunch that this is all for show and that the fbi has access through the nsa to all of this stuff why would they cancel prism  it s not like your average citizen can inspect the electronic infrastructure of this country and verify that  for example  metadata collection has stopped i think after edward snowden they sat in a room and decided to keep doing it and act like they were stopping it i would  i sound like a conspiracy theorist but i really do think the risks of terrorism are so great and siphoning data so easy that they re still doing it,1,

72285,i grew up in a very small rural town  the high school i attended is part of a huge high school rivalry  one of the biggest in the nation hell its not uncommon for 20000 plus fans to attend the rivalry game  its so big it s held in a college stadium and has more people attend it then the college division 1 team any way i have friends and family members who are convinced the only way to go to college and make something out of yourself is to get there on a football scholarship one of my cousins young kid 16ish has already had a few concussions  his dad just chalks it up to part of the game and thinks parents need to stop being such  pussies  football is for men and if a boy ca nt take it he will never be a man sadly i think a lot of parents feel this way,9,
72286,smart move by him  if anything athletes should be focusing back on baseball guaranteed money and long contract,9,
72287,and it begins  the exodus away from our national infatuation with football,8,
72288,tbi survivor here and former football fanatic even had a denver broncos tat which has since been covered with some other nonsense anyway  brain injuries are obviously bad news as is the nfl s handling of them  i hope this becomes a trend,7,
72289,good for him  football does nt have to be a concussion prone sport it started as the american version of rugby  and evolved into the form we see today  and can just as properly evolve into something that is nt effectively a form of human sacrifice  part of how it evolved is the career of pop warner  the coach of the carlisle indian school he kept  how to put it  coaching like a lawyer  and coming up with clever ways to get an edge  that would then eb slapped down with rule changes  surely concussions justify rule changes too,7,
72290,i played football for 4 years in highschool started all 4 years i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fu,3,
72291,this is really just a click bait story no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers  i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is,5,
72292,who would let their son play american football,3,

72296,plot twist  he ca nt shoot,1,
72297,there are so many cool sports out there that have gone down in popularity that are cool out therewrestling for example,1,
72298,i hope he wears a big ass helmet all the time in order to avoid irony them baseballs travel fast,,
72300,yes please too big to fail means they are too big  period break them apart,8,
72301,this seems like a no brainer not saying it will be easy  but why ever have banks too large to fail even exist,9,
72302,absolutely agree  but it will likely go nowhere it really is nt any different than when the government stepped in and broke up atamp  t into the baby bells unfortunately  this is talk by those who have no power to enforce change,6,
72303,seems like a good move if you re too big to fail  you are clearly in violation of antitrust and monopoly legislation  surely  plus  anything that is too big to fail is clearly just a bad idea from the standpoint of a societies ability to sustain unexpected shocks and surprises,7,
72304,big banks and wall street bank elections for both parties not going to happen unless supreme court reverses  citizens united  ruling allowing corporations to donate unlimited amount of funds to politicians and political parties as long as such bribery is legal  no politician will bite the hand that feeds himher,4,
72305,this is a political talking point floated to make sanders look like an over reactor if andor when he loses the nomination this guy and his idea will disappear from sight,5,
72306,hopefully  his floating that idea wo nt end up with him floating in the river,4,
72307,kashkari  eh  so  how does goldman sachs make money off of this,4,
72308,eh  wake me when they actually start breaking them up for now this is just more idle talk,4,
72309,i guess they could nt find a picture that makes him look crazier,4,
72310,if there are any economists here  i have a question how do we know that this wo nt have the same results as breaking up telecoms  regional monopolies collude until one is more successful and one starts to fail the successful one buys the failing one then this process repeats until the most successful one is enormous again  but with writeoffs  layoffs and debts thanks to the less successful ones consumers get screwed by footing the bill for the whole failed experiment  if telecoms can do that  why would we assume that banks wo nt just do the same thing  to the effect of even more pain for consumers,4,
72311,oh hey  it s the guy who ran for california governor,3,
72312,news update  spontaneous fires erupt in rome,3,
72313,no if we break up banks or make them have more capital  they will invest less  and folks on reddit will say its too hard to get a loan the banks will now actually want to make sure folks can actually pay back the loan  and a lot of folks have no assets  and will cry its not fair   only the rich are getting the loans    since they already have assets   are you sure you want to hold banks accountable  personally  i think its a great idea  but not sure you all realize the banks will just push that accountability back on you,3,
72314,that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money,1,
72315,probably not that big of a problem anymore they ve plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 20 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become,1,
72316,looks as though he s beginning a political career as a goldman  fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him asshole,1,
72317,breaking up huge banks reduces the chance that banks will get the giant bailouts the did after 2008 failures  massive corporate welfare they will lobby hard against the potential loss of a free ride,1,
72318,godless commie socialism yes pleas,1,
72319, flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca nt fail  did anyone else see this   wtf  so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further,1,
72320,trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it,1,
72321,from my armchair  i d say that the entire banking sector needs to be deleveraged 301 leverage  or whatever it currently is  is too much slowly  over time  to prevent shocks from the deleveraging   deleverage the banks  and it would make it harder for a crisis to become systemic,1,
72322,kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying,1,
72323,kashkari was part of the paulson team that leveraged the american banking empire into toobigtofail and now that that leverage is proving to be dangerous for the survival of the one per cent kleptocrats he wants to break up the tbtf banks  geithner knew this would manifest when he used tbtf as a stopgap measure to save the synagogue of satan worshiping kleptocracy of fraudsters that run the federal reserve now that same kleptocracy wants to be bailed out once again because geithner s temporary solution has run it s course straight into the gutter where geithner amp  kashkari et al  belong  up yours  america the functional retard,,
72325,also cars bad guys use those a lot and the internet also food,9,
72326,casinos would lobby against it a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small it would fit in a plastic shopping bag a million dollars in small bills is massive  there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash,8,
72327,how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 ,9,
72328,yeah if my big illegal bag of money was heavier  i d totally reconsider all the crime i do to obtain large bags of money it just would nt be worth the hassle,7,
72329,thank you but fuck no it s bad enough carrying around 100s to go buy cars amp  bikes on craigslist  now you want me to carry boxes of 20s   the  100 has plenty of legitimate uses  no need to make things harder for the 999  of the population that s lawabiding,9,
72330,thats why they got rid of the  500 billand it didnt work so well,8,
72331,keep marijuana and cocaine illegal  it s the 100 dollar bills that are the problem,7,
72332,i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four  5000 bills instead of two  10000 was too taxing better go straight,8,
72333,clearly  100 bills are the problem,7,
72334,people still listen to larry summers  i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008 or does cnn still think repealing glasssteagall was a good idea,7,
72335,it s not about stopping criminals it s about controlling peoples money with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically this is what done in europe to prevent  tax fraud ,7,
72336,might aswell remove any chemicals or equipment in the world that can make drugs aswell larry summers idea is stupid  it would nt just hurt criminals  it would hurt the innocent people aswell,7,
72337,in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the  100 bill it is very popular outside the us,5,
72338,the new blue  100 bills are too cool to replace,5,
72339,80  of the money supply being in  100 bills is the key statement this would likely be the first  and easiest  step to killing paper currency this is one of the initial hurdles to overcome  because they do nt give a fuck about it being tough on criminals  come on  when looking to implement negative interest rates,8,
72340,the thing about secondary labor markets  drugs  gambling  prostitution  etc  is that prohibition is what causes the main problems related to them these are black markets that will always have demand as long as the activities are forced underground by punitive policy  and that demand will always find a way around obstacles  making life marginally more difficult for the suppliers is only doing to make the products more dangerous  not less desirable,5,
72341,that is the most twisted logic   no more  100 bills  guess i ll stop dealing crack,5,
72342,okay larry last time we listened to you we deregulated the banks in 1999 nah larry  i m not gon na listen to you,5,
72343,make it illegal for poor people to ever have cash money so that you can freeze their accounts when their name shows up on the noflylist  eh  they already ca nt buy a car in cash without the dealership informing on them to the feds,6,
72344,how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds   ,4,
72345,i urge everybody here to watch inside job  it will shock you on how thoroughly corrupt this dude is  along with his buddies on wall street washington now he wants the gov to ban the  100 because of nirp  he does nt give a fuck about criminals using those or tax evasions do not listen to what this turd says,4,
72346,attention  we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash  except pennies   cash is privacy and should be a basic right,1,
72347,i wonder what larry would think about paul krugman s onetime pet project  the  trilliondollar coin   http  krugmanblogsnytimescom20130107bereadytomintthatcoin  _r  0 ,5,
72348,is something going on with all the major currencies  i saw a similar story about the euro notes too  http  wwwdailymailcoukwiresreutersarticle3448066ecbconsidersscrapping500euronotehtml also http  wwwdailymailcouknewsarticle3437590banksurgedban50notesbidendcashhandculturehelprecoupbillionstaxtreasuryhtml all these stories within a week of each other  i would nt be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency,3,
72349,currently in colorado  hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash,3,
72350,scrap larry summers  and get rid of a criminal,3,
72351,the only relevance to crime is the idea itself scam to grab more control of your money  bankster shenanigans do nt fall for it,3,
72352,the banks love this this means less people holding cash and more money that they can use to fuck us over remember folks  the rules are changing so that the money on deposit with banks is legally not yours if there s a bank failure  your money will be used to bail out the banks  the move is simply an extension of the war on cash,3,
72353,the fed stopped printing any bills higher than  100 in 1945 they began destroying the larger denominations actively in 1969  100 in 1945 is equivalent to  1300 today adjusting for inflation frankly they should be talking about issuing a  200 and  500 bill  if not also a  1000 bill,3,
72354,larry summers should be in prison  he is one of the architects of the 2008 collapse he also was instrumental in the repeal of glasssteagall the world would be better off without this fool and his dangerous ideas  http  wwwsourcewatchorgindexphp  title  larry_summer,3,
72355,does larry mean wall st criminals  of course not  white male entitlement it s what larry is all about unfortunately obama was dumb enough to bring summers into his administration where he flailed about  lamely attempting to cover upmake excuses as to why the theater burned down in 2008 with the financial  masters of the universe  still inside  larry proved his overall dumbness by predicting 2011 would be  recovery summer   based on nothing  no evidence just his  expert  opinion  there was no recovery in 2011,3,
72356,bring back the  500 and  1000 dollar bills dammit,3,
72357,larry summers  ladies and gentlemen one of the masterminds of financial deregulation is now proposing another hair brained idea summers  go clone yourself so you can go fuck yourself,3,
72358,just legalize crime everybody wins,3,
72359,fuk this illuminati puppe,4,
72360,the bulk of the value of cash in circulation is from  100 s get rid of cash and the fed can do any crazy policy it wants this is a necessary step towards negative interest rates nobody believes the government gives two shits about money laundering  florida real estate laws and hsbc getting zero criminal charges shows that is not the case,3,
72361,banksters do nt even use cash oh wait you re talking about the little criminals carry on,4,
72362,another attempt by the wealthy to outlaw cash our money is nt our money  according to the elite,5,
72363,then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination ,3,
72364,scrap the two  the single  the penny  half dollar and nickel instead,3,
72365,scrap the drugs too  make them illegal  oh wait,1,

72369,singapore has had the 10000 singapore dollar bill for some time it is still legal tender  but is going to be phased out slowly old notes will not be replaced  this is a calculated strategy by the sg government to comply with international counterterrorism and anti money laundering efforts  but minimising their own vulnerability to regulatory arbitrage,1,
72370,is nt the  100 bill the staple of american foreign trade  i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like  interestfree  loans  though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ,1,
72371,politicians do nt use  100s so how could it harm criminals,1,
72372,what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then,1,
72373,gt  the  100 bill is actually the second most common us bill in circulation  behind the  1 bill  gt  nearly 80  of the  14 trillion of us currency in circulation is in  100 bills much of it is held outside the united states  i m no math magician  but this does nt seem to fit,1,
72374,yeah  just watch  they will scrap it right down to the 20  anyone who wants to make largeish purchases will have to use electronic accounts that can be tracked  oh yeah   because crime  not  because government needs to track your every move,1,

72382,yes those evil people in government would love to get rid of cash and make everyone just use electronic money because then  the bank has your money and you only have an iou which they may  or may not  pay you back in the future  look at cyprus in 2013 where people did nt get their full deposited funds back because of the financial crisis  also they can charge you negative interest rateswhich means you have to pay for the bank to hold your funds  and of course if the govt has your money  then they have a great deal more power over you in deciding whether they should be nice and give it back to you or not  this is another reason why bitcoin is good  although they will ban that long before they ban cash,1,

72388,i lived 200yds from a burn pit when i was there in 04 i had some skin disease for about 2 years after iraq and some kind of asthma the va did nt give a shit then and they still do nt care  so  i got that goin for me,9,
72389,i was in tikrit  cob speicher  from 08 to 09 i lived a few hundred feet from the  burn pit  it was basically a huge junk yard with 3 huge constantly burning rectangular pits they were about 75 feet long and 50 feet across iirc you could see black or white smoke billowing from the area all the time i had to go there at least once a week to dump trash imagine standing over a red hot fire throwing junk off the back of a flatbed truck while it was 130 degrees outside sometimes the smog was so thick driving through the junk yard  that you could nt see 50 feet in front of you the smoke would almost always linger around the base and it smelled awful olfactory fatigue did not apply here it always smelled no matter how long you d be  exposed  you never got used to it never mind that they burned our shit right next door i remember one day we had to do a pt test the 2 mile run was on the same road as the burn pit smoke everywhere nobody passed that day some people were puking at the end i usually ran a 13  45 2 mile and i remember getting over 17 minutes i was gasping for air at the end we all thought the course was marked out incorrectly  but when we measured it later that day it was exactly 2 miles needless to say  nobody ever had any respiratory protection around these things  ever nor were we ever told we needed them i mean we had our gas masks in our gear  but nobody wanted to be  that guy  damn  we used to joke about it all the time whenever someone would start spewing some  war story   or when some freshoutabasic private would try to tell us about  that one time my drill sergeant made us do this  story   at the end we d say   yeah  but have you ever been to the burn pit    then we d laugh it off i guess it s not so funny anymore,8,
72390,my husband  half  jokes about the cancer he s going to get from the burn pits in afghanistan from what he described  they were horrible,7,
72391,this hits close to home we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight i really need to get this checked out,7,
72392,i can understand why burning trash and human waste may be unavoidable in certain military circumstances like in those remote outposts in afghanistan that might house 1520 people  there really are nt any good alternatives  however it seems less defensible to not have invested in better infrastructure once you had permanent bases the size of small cities  once you re at the point where soldiers had their own little airconditioned houses made out of cargo containers with air conditioning  satellite television  and onbase burger king it seems like you can probably invest in some proper trash incinerators instead of open burn pits,7,
72393,gt  though the us government disputes it well  color me surprised,8,
72394,a tsgt i know died recently from cancer he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family he was 32 his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer,7,
72395, support our troops with a ribbon sticker   that will definitely make up for all the fucked up shit the government puts them through,7,
72396,not surprised saw a guy in the va who used to jog through the base with his unitteam  not sure of the terminology   breathing in the smoke from one of these every day for 4 years he had some chronic lung condition we were working up  and said a couple of his buddies also have lung problems now otherwise perfectly healthy 40 years old  completely unnecessary illness due to stupidity andor apathy,6,
72397,http  wwwpublichealthvagovexposurescamplejeune for decades  the government knowingly allowed service members and their dependents to consume contaminated tap water fifteen diseases are recognized to have a direct relation to the contamination but many more are cropping up yet the government wo nt recognize those  yet   and they re filing motions to have claims tossed out based on statute of limitations  even though the government did nt even announce the contamination until over a decade after the wells were closed  this is nt just an agent orange or iraq war contamination where soldiers were exposed and have problems babies born at the base hospital hadhave an alarmingly high rate of birth defects but nothing is being done about it and the va continues to deny claims we ll just go ahead and add this one to the list,6,
72398,uhh i ve had a severe cough for 34 years now  since coming back from afghanistan  it ll get so bad  that i ll cough until i throw up  and then cough more  the va said it was normal i m sure they know what they re talking about i feel fine,6,
72399,i remember having to sit through a 2 hour briefing the first week i arrived in iraq  back in 2008 we were told that scientists verified that the burn pit on base was not a detriment to our health  then we had to sign forms when i returned stateside  there were quite a few reports of people having respiratory issues after returning from deployment  the va also denied that any illnesses were related to desert storm it took a long time for anyone other than veterans to admit that desert storm syndrome was a real thing  and then said veterans had to go through the gauntlet of proving their illnesses were related to their deployment,7,
72400,goddamn  it s unbelievable the way vets are treated shame,6,
72401,government does nt give a fuck about veterans,5,
72402,my 36yo buddy was just diagnosed with nonhodgkens lymphoma when he visited the va to do the paperwork they asked what bases he served at overseas  and literally had a list of diseases to reference per base just got a  yep  here it is probably from the burn pit  from the clerk thumbing down the list when he told me i was blown away  why is nt there any followup with soldiers who served at these bases    even a simple  you may want to get screened  when he returned from service would have given us some hope of getting in front of it it s incredibly irritating,5,
72403,the us lying about iraq and afghanistan  nah  never happen,7,
72404,do nt worry guys we ll take care of your medical needs when you come home oh wait,5,
72405,do nt forget area 51 they had burn pits like you would nt believe stealth materiels that had top secret components in them the poor guys that were exposed to all of this could nt even go for help  many died in secrecy  i know i was exposed to vaporized depleted uranium and who knows what else i have a sort of bet with my self that i ll die an early death,5,
72406,so  the dod did nt learn any lessons from previous burn pits  i mean  when you have to declassify area 51 because of workers health decline due to burn pits  you d think you d remember this shit is wrong,5,
72407, though he returned home safely in september 2009  he woke up one day a few months later with an inexplicable headache  numbness in his limbs and paralysis on one side of his body beau had suffered a mild stroke his health deteriorated  and he was diagnosed with brain cancer less than two years later  he died at the age of 46  holy fuck    fuck wars and politicians that start them,4,
72408,the us govt so cares about its troops,7,

72411,there are so many things wrong with this i do nt even know what to say  let s just purposefully burn hazardous material  petroleum products  chemicals  and batteries next to our camp oh  and throw some explosives in there while you re at it and vaporizes all that shit so we can breath it in are you kidding me,4,
72412,holy shit  my friend who was on the poop burning detail a bunch of times died of throat cancer earlier this year my first thought was it was the poop burning that did it  and i m concerned as well because i did my fair share of that as well,4,
72413,where we lived there was a burn pit that was nearby and the smoke would always float over to where we were  as of yet i dont have any symptoms but i do have a begine growth in my head  i have had it checked but i am paranoid that it could become bad ,4,
72414,little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did nt have to bother to actually lob chemicalbio weapons at us we d send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chembio bomb themselves  did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney,4,
72415,every time i allow myself a shred of regret for not enlisting  i remind myself that this kind of shit is what the us does to its soldiers fuck that i respect your service and all that  but fuck that shit,1,
72416,every goddamn war the military has to do something that exposes troops to dangerous chemicals,3,
72417,makes me wonder  i was at camp addertallil back in 2010  2011  what was i exposed to,3,
72418,i was in taji in 2011 2 people got cancer after our deployment  lots of people were having breathing problems we were right next to the tank graveyard and the burn pit was constantly going in our rush to shut down theater i ve gotten lung infections every year since then,3,

72437,let the  14 dollar beer flow,8,
72438,corruption of public officials in michigan  no way,9,
72439,i certainly do nt necessarily agree with public funds being used for a sports stadium  and i definitely do nt agree with nepotism  but i think criticizing mike illitch somehow taking advantage of detroit is a shortsighted mistake had it not been for mr illitch pretty much singlehandily reinvesting in a city everyone wanted to leave behind over the last 20 years  the city would nt even be close to back on a path to relevancy  whether you want to believe it is or not   the other thing to consider is that this new complex not only brings commerce to an area that was a combination of blight and open fields  it also brings quite a few jobs to the city  as well as some stateoftheart buildings that will bring commerce and international travelers to the area for a variety of reasons  conferences  concerts  etc   this all equals more money for the city of detroit  which is why they re willing to make the investment in the first place   and another part of a blightfilled neighborhood updated and usable for the future  this is a sticky situation that reeks of an unfortunate quidproquo  but when it comes to what is good for the city of detroit  it s hard to argue that anyone has anything on the passion and dedication of mike illitch,9,
72440,how in the fuck are there no comments about the red wings owner s hair  ,9,
72441,everyone talks about the insanity in pro sports these days  yet no one mentions  public or private  universities  which are all nonprofit  spending massive amounts of their cash on stadiums  athletic facilities  etc it s the same thing if the universities are public  and its only marginally different if they re private the reason they have that money in the first place is federallysubsidized student loans,8,
72442,lol illitch has done more for the city of detroit than any other person in the last 50 years fuck off,9,
72443,so he did a good job for the team and the owner offered him more money for a better job  happens all the time  kids,6,
72444,is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit  or ford field  most people would not step foot downtown if it was nt for those two places i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do nt bring forth revitalization like intendedbut the only article i ve read was about stadiums in la and sf,6,
72445,before you jump on the  why ca nt detroit use the money for things that actually matter  train   here s   http  wwwcrainsdetroitcomarticle20140921news309219990oncostfinancingofwingsarenahereareanswers  an article outlining the finances of this massive project  edit  s  for those not wanting to click  gt  the initial base price is  450 million problems  changes and added amenities could increase that final cost anything beyond  450 million must be paid by the ilitches  gt  the michigan strategic fund will sell  450 million in two series of bonds they will be divided into  250 million in series a bonds that will be backed by property taxes already captured by the downtown development authority the  200 million in series b bonds will be backed by the  115 million olympia development has agreed to pay the dda for bond retirement  gt  the ilitches  through olympia  will pay  200 million of the bond debt detroit s dda  via its property tax capture ability  will pay back  250 million of the bonds new yorkbased merrill lynch  a division of bank of america  which has pledged to buy all the publicly backed series a bonds in the deal it will then sell the bonds to the public dallasbased comerica bank inc will buy the series b bonds backed by olympia s money the bank  formerly based in detroit  has the naming rights to comerica park  where the ilitchowned detroit tigers play comerica intends to keep the bonds on its books rather then sell them,8,
72446, misleading title   https  wwwredditcomrhockeycomments45xs0mdetroit_contractor_who_negotiated_285_million_ind00vnke   it was state money  not detroit s also  ilitch footed most of the bill himself  or through his company   please research  the district  and see their plans for it before passing judgement,9,
72447,clickbait no one around here is remotely upset about taxpayer funds going to a new stadium for the most popular team in town we re not really unhappy about the new development for business and residences that is happening and we re not raising any concerns about the effort to revitalize the city  detroit is climbing out of a hole created by the corruption of influential individuals local business and leaders have been more beneficial in this process than any other group and this stadium  and the district surrounding it are seen as victories in this effort,8,
72448,ah  a local spin on the old  congressperson becomes lobbyist  setup,5,
72449,they are literally building new district for the city not just an arena  a whole new district development is what the city needs and frankly  detroit politics have always been just a  wee  bit corrup,4,

72453,public money should never be allowed to pay for sports teams unless the team has to pay back the city directly  with interest none of this but businesses will benefit  bullsht it s my fucking money you re stealing  i do nt want to  potentially  subsidize businesses downtown,8,
72454,if you re a bernie supporter  who thinks a public funded  1 trillion dollar infrastructure package is a good deal because jobs  but is outraged by the state of michigan investing  285 million in the renovationrevitalization of its  largest city  then you might want to reexamine one of those positions,6,
72455,for all the people complaining about spending the money on the new stadium and  less mentioned  surrounding developments  all i can say is it will be more than worth it if it fixes up that area governments of all levels have been dumping money into the cass corridor since the early days of johnson s great society programs with any luck this will finally be a solution that stick,7,
72456,itt  out of staters have no fucking idea about the current state of economics in detroit and how great this project is going to be for the city  i do nt even know where to begin with this article it s clear the author did nt talk to a single person in the city or state or even try to get a feel for the public opinion on the topic including garbage clickbait phrases like the previous article titled  detroit scam city  how the red wings took hockeytown for all it had  has to be one of the dumbest fucking things i ve ever read  when detroit was at its absolute rock bottom worst  going to joe louis arena was probably the only reason suburban white people would ever go into the city and spend money now mike ilitch wants to build a gigantic urban development project including restaurants  shopping stores    apartment complexes   and oh yeah a brand new stateoftheart arena for one of the most successful hockey teams of all time  they have nt missed the playoffs since before i was born  25 years ago they are a big deal and have been for decades   oh  and it s being built at the exact time there s an influx of young people and new businesses into the the city which will create more upward momentum  yes  the city is helping pay for it the city also got a lot of input on it design  layout  and what additional projects would be built along with the arena this happens in every single city an arenastadium is built i do nt necessarily think that s how it should work but the fact of the matter is that this is how these deals are made and the city absolutely needs projects like this if it wants to continue on its upward trend  also attacks on mike ilitch in this article and this thread are disgusting illitch has been a controversial figure for a long time but his story is like example of the american dream you d see in fiction his parents were poor immigrants  he grew up in detroit joined the marines played minor league baseball for the team he now owns opens up a mom and pop pizza place and creates an empire out of it  gets rich while creating jobs and doing public works projects for the city he grew up in even though it s a complete shit hole mike ilitch has been spending  and yes  making  money in detroit for years mike ilitch was there in the 90 s and early 00 s before there was ever a housing crash in the rest of the country the man is nt a saint but if it were nt for him there would be a lot less charities and projects being invested in now he wants to build a project the city desperately needs with the city s help and input  and he s getting shit on by some dumb ass  journalist  that ca nt get their facts straight  endran,7,
72457,someone call charlie leduff,5,
72458,good old cronyism at its finest  nothing new to detroit at all,5,
72459,i wonder if journalists really think this is breaking news,3,
72460,where is my surprise face,3,
72461,a city official operating at a congressional level,3,
72462,gt  detroit contractor who negotiated  285 million in public money for the red wings now works with red wings owner so  i love how these headlines are supposed to make us feel outraged,4,
72463,same shit happened here in richardson  texas  a suburb of dallas   the mayor brought in a huge company to the city and then left office to get a job with that same company it also turns out she was having an affair with a guy from that company too,3,
72464,stop giving public money let business deal with business  not government  which can only be scammed and lead to corruption and bloated monopolies promote free market  and separation of power,3,
72465,to be fair  he was working with him then too,1,
72466,i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him,1,
72467,conflict of interests everywhere,1,
72468,this is how it worksthere is nt anything new to this story that is nt happening in nearly every major city and state across the country  i do nt like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it,1,
72469,public money  om,1,
72470,wow  you mean so someone who worked very closely with an organization and built relationships decided to work for said company later on in their career  shocking  i tell you,1,
72471,everyone from the owners to the safety and comfort of the city and everyone thinks this whole plan is going to a country that did not mainly speak my language  i would learn it,1,
72472,what a shocking surprise,1,
72473,well that s convenien,1,
72474,in other news  bears do  it turns out  shit in the woods,1,
72475,can we just start an embarrass the fuck out of these greedy punks campaign,1,
72478,interesting though   since 2005  texas has prosecuted 38 juveniles for intoxication manslaughter or intoxication assault only three were sent to the adult system  and half of all cases resulted in probation of some kind  i think this is more telling of the justice system  and accessibility to competent  quality counsel it s clear money buys better legal counsel  but if the government subsidized public defense more heavily  the outcomes would clearly be different,9,
72479,cash is king in the world of corruption,9,
72480,i said this somwhere else  but it s also pertinent here  everyone is equal under the law and money is how we measure that equality,9,
72481,the difference  money,9,
72482,it s almost like the rich live under different rules,8,
72483,this is standard practice in the us judicial system outcomes will vary from case to case depending on financial status there s actually a legal term for it  it s called   cream ,9,
72484,my mom has always said guilty until proven rich,8,
72485,i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law this is the american dream,8,
72486,and liberty and justice for all  who can afford it ,5,
72487,i love how this article just glosses over the fact that arellano had previous dui convictions which is why he did nt receive the same sentence  this was couch s first dui case which is why he got probation  as texas takes the rehab route  but whatever lets rage and ignore the fact,8,
72488,is everyone here honestly  seriously shocked that money gets you out of trouble  am i taking crazy pills,5,
72489,going beyond the dae legal system is corrupt  circlejerk in this thread  there are certainly some differences in these cases firstly  the arellano case  the other one in the article  happened in 2007  six years before couch s trial likewise  the article says that arellano had driven while intoxicated and drank underage before  which means that he would ve had a greater chance of being moved to an adult trial meanwhile  couch had no prior violations of the law  meaning that he could nt be moved to an adult court,6,
72490,i understand what you are trying to do with your anecdotal case comparisons however  they are nt comparable cases when you consider all the factors  including criminal history  but  even if you ignore all the other factors  i know of a white 20 yo male from a fairly wealthy family in my area who was sent to prison for a year based on a drunk driving accident so my anecdotal evidence shows similar punishment to your anecdotal case thereby anecdotally refuting your point,8,
72491,the real crime here those eyebrow,6,
72492,gee  it s almost like different judges and prosecutors in different areas with separate cases can lead to different verdicts or something,6,
72493,that s why the case became famous because he got away while guilty that was autocorrect capitalization,4,
72494,affluenza is just a fake term that means the following  if you are rich  you do nt go to jail if you are not  you will spend 10 years like 95  of americans,4,
72495,let s be clear what happened to the poor kid was what s supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone you fucking go to prison couch was the exception,7,
72496,he did nt go free he was on probation and then he violated that  so he s going to jail,8,
72497,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,3,
72498,if someone is brought up too rich to not know the difference between right and wrong  why can the same argument not be used for poor people who commit crimes  people who are brought up in poverty do nt really know right from wrong just as much as a kid who has rich parents,3,
72499,that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time,3,
72500,  sees title   probably not a rich white kid   clicks article   and yuuuuuuuuuup sm,3,
72501,prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win,3,
72502,obviously as white god intended,4,
72503,i fucking hate ethan couch  i mean look at that look on his face disgusting i mean even his name is stupid,5,
72504,horrible headline  38 cases of dui manslaughter in texas since 2005 and only 3 of them went to adult court  that tells you the vast majority of these cases are handled with kid glovesso picking out one of 3 that went the other route and comparing it to the affluenza case is disingenuous  but fuck it  that is what the media does today god forbid they instead do an article focusing on how in texas if you are a drunk driving kid that kills people you will get away with it 35 out of 38 time,4,
72505,it did nt seem to mention how they had the same judge  we ve already established this same judge would have been open to giving a similar sentence to a poor minority because she tried to do just that keep making this a race issue  though lord knows the media loves to stir up ignorant poor folks  also  anyone who comes to the us illegally and kills is citizens deserves little sympathy he was a juvenile  so it would be appropriate to release him and deport him  i do nt understand the need to distort issues to make tbem about race we already have enough problems it s already an established fact that those with the means to afford a lawyer fair better than those who do nt,3,
72506,the difference  money,1,

72510,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,1,

72512,cash rules everything around me they have  and very good lawyers,1,
72513,well  on one hand you have a kid that killed 3 adults and a child in a crash  and on the other a kid who killed a mother and her  unborn child  in a crash in a conservative state so he could have mowed down 10 born people and probably got less than what he gets for  accidentally  killing 1 unborn baby,1,

72515,this affluenza thing still baffles me  doing bad things because money  with that sort of logic hobos must be saints and not the crack heads living under bridges,1,
72516,no shit  i mean was nt the entire outrage that similar cases normally lead to prison in the first place,1,
72517,seriously  the rich kid,1,
72518,that s what  affluenza  means literally the entire point of this case and why it s been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich,1,
72519,i say it like my grandma used to  money talks  bullshit walks,1,
72520,he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows wtf,1,

72527,the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though,9,
72528,it should be interesting to see how she s ruled in cases of dui in the past,9,
72529,she refused a breathalyzer meh she ll beat thi,9,
72530,would nt being drunk compromise her ability to judge  how many times has she been impaired while working  should nt anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least  what should i make for dinner,9,
72531,offitherrrr i am the la,9,
72532,no one has mentioned this yet but she got pulled over at 8 am drinking in the morning  this judge has some problems,9,
72533,rochesterian here the article failed to mention that she was also driving with 2 flat tires for who knows how long,8,

72540,well who s gon na judge the case now,5,
72541,her judgement was impaire,6,
72542,fry needs to weigh in here  http  imgurcomgvji0u,6,
72543,to be clear  the fact that she refused a breathalyzer is important in many states it is treated as evidence of impairment and justification for arrest she knew that i have many friends who are criminal defense attorneys and all have told me they advise to refuse breathalyzer always  unless there is a court order  i m not familiar with ny law  but i can pretty much guarantee she will not be convicted of dui if middle classcollege kids can get out of them  a federal judge surely can since it said nothing about a field sobriety test  i assume they either did nt administer one  or they did and she did not meet criteria for impairment,5,
72544,my friends mom is a judge and that lady boozes super hard and will drive her car around i have seen her come home from the bar completely in ruins at least a dozen times over the last 10 years she is fearless  we live in a small town in wisconsin with a huge police presence she knows all the officers and has never had an issue the whole situation seems completely ridiculous she gives out sentences for dui all day and then drives drunk all night oh god  the hypocrisy,5,

72559,how many hellfire missiles would that buy,8,
72560,this is a great thing people who are bashing him do not make much sense the monuments in dc are one of the united states  greatest treasures  and likewise they cost a lot to maintain let alone refurbish they are a public venue that is traversed by millions and are awesome to each person that visits  this guy decided to use some of his money to give back and better public places that reside in our nation capital and some see him as an asshole  it is one thing to be bitter about not having that kind of money  it is another thing to get pissed when someone with money gives back,7,
72561,its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring,3,
72562,good for him i remember the lincoln memorial being one of my more favorite monuments i d like to take my son there some day  so it s nice to see it will be upgraded and fixed up  to all the naysayers and negative commenters  fuck you,5,

72567,i think it s great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about what i do nt like is that there should nt even be an issue with funding for our monuments,4,
72568,if we re committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i m all for it,1,
72569,i wonder how many huge donations like this  maybe smaller  in the hundreds of thousands  have been made for national monuments pretty awesome someone did this wo reading the article  i have to imagine there s a good amount of rigmarole on the donor s end to ensure the donation goes to where the donor actually wanted govt accountability on any level in the us seems kind of weak lately,1,
72570,all right  a 15000sqft exhibit room underneathkind of like the one in fallout ,3,
72571,can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too,,
72572,oh cool thanks  philanthropist guy,3,
72573,wow  what an honorable thing to do  while 99  of people in his position would spend the money on useless crap  this guy chooses to spend his money on something so selfless and so much bigger than himself  this guy is a good 1  e,,
72574,it d be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro,1,
72575,that s nice for a full on rapist to do,,
72576,let s laugh at people in need by blowing tens of millions on nonessential shit that basically benefits nobody in any significant way  edit  and get tax breaks from it too,1,
72577,no matter what some peasant is going to whine rich guy should ve just kept his money to himself and these poors would nt even know  i thank him  i ll go to dc eventually the whiners here probably could nt afford any type of vacation  or if they could  only by living paycheck to paycheck,,
72578,we are living in a new gilded age,,
72579,i certainly appreciate what david has done here but  with all due respect to david  most americans would rather not see financial industry groups  like the carlyle group  suck economic resources out ofaway from most americans instead  we d prefer to pay for these efforts through widespread  robust economic opportunities and the tax contributions they make possible millions of americans and this nation have been greatly diminished as a result of the business activities of groups  like the carlyle group  over several decades  because of grotesque incomewealth inequality  the odds of seeing successful businesspeople like david rubinstein are greatly diminished he only got where he was because of the social ladder that used to exist in this nation,,
72580,how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions,,
72581,it s gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface themfight to take them down,,
72582,those goddamn rich people are at it again  dammit if we could only find a way to tax away their wealth so we could spend it on poorly negotiated deals for mediocre roads and bridges,,
72583,wow  what a waste of money,,
72584,fixing stupid shit is hardly philanthropy,,
72585,i m pretty sure there are roads around there that could have used that money  priorities  people,,

72591,this is why a lot of former cops are setting up companies where they transport the cash for it it s also a huge motivation for the stores to keep 2 separate sets of books  a real one and one the irs gets to see,9,
72592,this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day,9,
72593,gt  one of the three men who escaped from a california jail last month had been charged with kidnapping a marijuana dispensary owner that they suspected had hidden large amounts of cash in the desert the man and his accomplices are accused of driving the dispensary owner out to the desert  torturing him and cutting off his penis  sheesh i m not carrying more than  10 in my wallet from now on  and that has nothing to do with the fact that i m broke,9,
72594,this is why they get robbed all the time out here no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys,7,
72595,ca nt these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us,8,
72596,there s a great documentary on netflix called  high profits  about a business in breckenridge  co right before full legalization took effect  one of the big issues was exactly this only being able to do business in cash from payroll to paying city taxes they had  120k in cash they had to just walk into the front of the city building with and that was just the first month alone  some of the people that make the drops to the shops are walking out with  10k in their pockets and no security at all it s terrifying,8,
72597,civil forfeiture time,6,
72598,ironically  it s also just flat out illegal to own large sums of money anything over a few hundred bucks  and the government can sieze that money  because the money committed the crime of intent to purchase narcotics,9,
72599,time to start using gold,6,
72600,so the tax man will gladly take cannadollars  but the banks will not this is ridiculously stupid,6,
72601,same deal in washington still have to buy my shit with cash oh but i can buy cigs and alcohol with a card no problem  if you want to pick up a gram here or there it s no problem  but i buy in bulk  since it s cheaper that means i need to stop by the bank to get  140 that s the only time i carry that much money on me  it s like requiring a personal check to get a passport no cashier s check  no card wtf it s 2016,8,
72602,are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money,4,
72603,this war on cash is such bullshit  people carried cash until 12 years ago and it was perfectly fine  now they are trying to restrict flying with cash  purchasing with cash  seizing cash   the only problem is that the money is due on one day  they need to have the tax office take payment on any day of the week  so it s stacked,6,
72604,i wonder how negative interest rates  if implemented  would effect the marijuana business these value of the business would probably increase as they had large sums of cash on hand their credit worthiness would increase because they had something of value  cash  but they would be penalized for depositing that cash according to the recent imf working paper i wonder if they would become attractive targets for some banks to help capitalize their weak balance sheets,3,
72605,oh well let you do business  but you just wo nt be able to use any banks what a backwards ass countr,3,
72606,this is a perfect storm for evil doers who seize this unfortunate opportunity all they would have to to do is steak out a caregiver facility i would hope something changes soon this is absurd and the last word of that article  like my post  is penis,3,

72620,what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit  checks for those transactions  then just but the trees with the gift certificate,1,
72621,as if the banks do nt take drug money as we speak it is also not like the fbi do nt have cases on going against those banks i really do nt see why there is a problem,1,
72622,can they not employ armored trucks,1,
72623,it s the same way in washington and colorado it s still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed,1,
72624,since the money cant be deposited into a bank would a good option to take be converting it into precious metals such as gold  you would still need to store the gold but that could be easily done in a safety deposit however unless you know where to go  getting that much gold could raise the attention of people you dont want raised to begin with it s not like in china or india  if you show up with a briefcase of cash and walk out with a smaller case of gold  no one really cares,1,
72625,can they print their tax forms using hemp paper  and then turn them into the irs,1,
72626,watch out for that   cop robbery   civil asset forfeiture,1,
72627,so  did anyone else read that article right to the end  the last sentence oof,1,
72628,it would be interesting for all of the companies to announce they were bringing their taxes to the tax office on a particular day let it be known to all criminals in the state i wonder if the state might decide to put some security on the place  then,1,
72629,build your own secure fort no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building,1,
72632,that article is really light on details  does anyone know why this happened  did the guy not respond to a court summons or something along those lines  is nt a default the judgement the usual result in that situation,9,
72633,this happened in feb  2003 in minnesota as well  article   http  wwwmndailycom20030214usmarshalsarreststudentloandebtorstwincities,9,
72634,what happens if you literally ca nt pay your loans  asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11  just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job  edit  something a lot of you do nt seem to realize is that these were private loans there s no forgiveness with those,9,
72635,not really too much context given here  so it s hard to guess at the actual situation  but federal student loans  at least direct loans and the majority of those older loans passed back to fsa as they phased out the guarantee programs  do nt get sold to private collection agencies at this time maybe that part happened a while back  before current policies went into place and the collectors are taking advantage of the protections that federallyoriginated loans have  anyway  for people who are interested in learning more about how defaulted federal student loans are being collected today   check this out   https  wwwfbogovindex  s  opportunityamp  mode  formamp  id  216a8418f8e71f0c9c3475946ab100f8amp  tab  coreamp  _cview  1  they re currently in the middle of contracting new private collection agencies to service defaulted loans and you can see in the rfp documents how agencies are being scored and how that ties into account assignments  basically  for those who do nt feel like running through all of it  the big emphasis for student loan collections now is getting people through affordable rehabilitation options and into incomedriven repayment plans placements look like they re going to be based about 50  on careful regulatory compliance and borrower satisfaction surveys  which would make it extremely difficult for high pressure collections tactics to work out in the long run  none of that changes this story  just thought it was interesting in light of some of the comments i ve read that indicate people believe strongarm collection tactics for student loans will always be the norm  tldr  they re at least trying to throw a friendly paint job over the horribly broken federal student loan system these days,9,
72636,if you dont show up to court after you have been served this is what happens he has been ignoring collection attempts  he got served and ignored that too im not in favor of this man being arrested but you cant ignore court summons if you get served you have to go,9,
72637,upconwell said it best  gt  you are reading way to much into the article no one said they were violent no one said they had their guns drawn they are us marshals  they carry guns  every god damn day   gt  they probably went to his door  knocked he answered and they said  hey  we have a warrant for you for failing to appear in a federal court   he probably said  oh shit let me get some pants  gt  no violence  no guns drawn  everything was pretty standard and nonviolent  gt  plus  it should be noted that he was not arrested for failing to pay student loans  he was arrested for violating a court order,9,
72638,how do you not pay a  1500 loan after 30 friggin years,9,
72639,gt  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  this almost reads like satire,9,
72640,i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors,9,
72641,where in this article did it say  guns drawn  as most people are stating here  it says  with guns   every on duty us marshal goes through their day  with guns   someone signed a contract for a loan  and then spends almost three decades not paying it i agree that a police force should nt have been used there are financial measures that can be taken upon default of a loan rather than criminal  but i m really surprised by the circle jerk that s happening over a fox news article,9,
72642,can i get a misleading title please,8,
72643,you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day,6,
72644,lol  you guys are so gullible the guy dodged this debt and refused to engage the proper authorities for 25 years this is nt a new college graduate that missed one payment then you have the cascade of predictable posts stating  boot lickers    debtors prison  and how in 30 years this will be the watershed moment we all look back to as we are enslaved by the government this is a statement case the feds took an extreme example and made an extreme example of this putz the goal of this action is compliance and to get folks to not ignore their obligations the money spent on this will scare the other million folks that are past due to actually pick up the phone and engage them to resolve the debt no one held a gun to this guy s head to sign up for the student loans and no one was stopping him for 25 years from making a payment plan for the remaining  1500 this guy deserved it and as a tax payer this is ok by me,9,
72645,real story here dude was sued by the united state of america  he refused to appear  a default judgment was issued against him  he refused to appear for postjudgment depositions  judge issued an order directing him to appear in court  he ignored it and then the judge issued an arrest warrantincareration order and federal judges use us marshalls to enforce their orders  so he was nt arrested for having old student loans he was arrested for refusing to comply with a direct order from the judge  http  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386htm,8,
72646,that dude could not come up with  1500 in 29 years,8,
72647, a few years ago congress allowed the private sector to contract for student loan collections and so you have these private companies who are doing this  i find this scary  even though i have no student loans to pay off they dragged this dude to court and made him sign an agreement in front of their private attorney he had no attorney present  and was nt read any rights  edit  quote is from the video,9,
72648,forever grateful i graduated with minimal student loans ca nt ignore bills for 25 years though  regardless of what those payments stem from from reading through the comments here  it seems like incomebased payment option is the smartest option,6,
72649,i wish my student loan balance was  1500,6,
72650,i knew this story was light on facts turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies  source   yahoo finance   https  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386html,6,
72651,gt  our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is nt the first and wo nt be the last  this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least,8,
72652,he was nt arrested for not paying his loan  he was arrested for not showing up in court  and the marshals did nt storm his house guns blazing they had guns  with them   like every other cop in the entire country,7,
72653,if you take money and have no plans on paying it back  it s called stealing,9,
72654,right the debt collectors just bought the debt  payed the filing fees to bring the case to court  threatened the man with their now official   pay us or else  and when he did not they used their settlement to have him arrested by the marshals nope  no government officers for hire here  just good old debt collection paid and serviced through the courts,5,
72655,til that most people have no understanding how the court system works  yes  civil attorneys can issue subpoenas  yes  a court can hold you in contempt if you fail to appear yes  a potential punishment for contempt is a bench warrant for your arrest  tl  dr  you can not simply ignore subpoenas you may go to jail,5,
72656,writing and publishing articles like this is dangerous the author offered a sensationalist angle on the  story  while leaving out key elements of why they were there in the first place ie missing court summons this is highly unethical and paints the federal government into a larger narrative that fox has been going for basically  rallying people by emotion not logic,5,
72657,this just in  there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government film at 1,5,
72658,student loans were made with certain assumptions about the future of the economy  both on the part of the schools  the tuition they charge   the lenders  and the student people should be required to pay their student loans but they should be adjusted downward  edit  this guy had a loan for  1500 measly bucks and did nt make any payments in 30 years  i would like to know if he was destitute  or just decided  fuck you everyone  i want to keep my money ,8,
72659,misleading title the marshals service will  arrest  you if you fail to show up for a court appearance you are not being tossed in jail  you are being hauled into court when you refused to answer a summons  from the article   paul aker says he was arrested at his home last week for a  1500 federal student loan he received in 1987  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  does anyone feel sorry for this man   1500  be serious,7,
72660,if i did nt pay back a federal loan for 29 years  i d kind of expect for there to be negative effects this dude did nt pay his loan  including when he was taken to court over it and received a judgment from the court specifically telling him to pay it if you ignore a court order  you re gon na have a bad time  i mean yes  the financial aid system needs to be fixed  but they re going after people who purposely are nt paying their loans which is a surprising amount of people  given how many refund chasers there are in the world for anyone else  there are programs like deferment options  sliding payscales  and whatever else along with loan forgiveness after 20 years  it s a shitty system  but this guy s case is not going to be the one to change it because he does nt deserve to have people dying on his hill for his particular cause,7,
72661,i m socialist and firmly believe that education and medical care should be paid for by federal government out of contributions that we make  however with that said  if you are contributing member of society you have to be a special kind of asshole not to repay  1500 loan over the period of 29 years no matter what was that loan used for,8,
72662,why is this news,3,
72663,dude got letters in his mail for months to pay and appear in court  this doesnt just come out of the blue he refused to show up to court multiple times thats a criminal offense,5,
72664,the revolution will not be subsidize,5,
72665,the whole student loan thing is a complete disaste,6,
72666,talk is cheap  between the intelligence agencies  an the lack of marijuana decriminalizatoinlegalizatoin  obama is nt that idfferent from previous administration,5,
72667,just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to the paper really is nt worth it otherwise college is becoming a joke anyways,5,
72668,every interaction i have ever had with navient  they have done everything they can to work with me  is your payment affordable  would you like a deferment  etc  i have had to take them up on that because of divorce not saying that is everyone s experience but they have nt been the loan sharks everyone else seems to act like they are just one man s experience though,5,
72671,well  that ought to take care of the problem,1,
72672,i like that guy after all  i would only do it for the money with minimal violence  and would never want to kill people so  if i ever decide to go and work for a cartel  i m  definitely  working for el jesus,1,
72673,is he hiring mercenaries  or he has enough already  it s also not a problem to join any military  as they re all doing god s work,1,
72674,well  if their since could nt be instantly forgiven  that might have had weight,1,

72678,this makes sense a lot of people in science fields relating to cancer formation  such as radiology and medicinal biology  are of the opinion that most cancerous tumors are actually quietly killed by the body before they can reach critical mass to defend themselves  and the ones that prove dangerous are the ones that either do nt register to t cells or which grow too quickly to be snuffed to simplify  the reasons for this are simple  not everyone dies from cancer  and everyone gets exposed to carcinogens given the rate of mutation  the influence of radiation  the amount of background radiation  etc  that everyone is unavoidably exposed to  we should all develop tumors if there is a true casual relationship if you simply say that the body is helpless against them naturally  we would all die from cancer the body  must  be defending itself from them given that we do nt  in fact  it s basically accepted as scientific truth cancer is nt simply the presence of cancerous tumors  it s the presence of cancerous tumors that have the right surrounding cells  in the right quantity  that do nt die from immune system intervention and which have favorable growth conditions most small tumors simply do nt have the right conditions  and die studies have confirmed that the ones that register as cancer are a subset of all tumors that might form  because this subset avoids the usual limiting factors  so  going back to the article  this is simply taking the bodies natural process for fighting tumors and guiding it to specific cancers it might normally miss and saying  go get it   then praying you did nt just kill the poor sap with his now manically overenthusiastic immune system,6,
72679,gt  the treatment involves removing the tcells from patients  tagging them with  receptor  molecules that target cancer  and putting them back into the body in an infusionthe targeting molecules  known as chimeric antigen receptors or cars  came from specially bred genetically engineered mice   gt  in one study  94 percent of participants suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia  all  said their symptoms vanished completely after they were treated with the modified blood cells  known as tcells  it looks like this could be a very  very big deal i m surprised that  as of this comment  this post is not getting much attention,7,

72681,this is a breakthrough right up until the pharmaceutical companies buy the process and tuck it away forever  there s no money to be made in curing a disease,1,
72682,i m rather hopeful that we ll be able to cure most cancers within the next 20 years or so  and hopefully before that we ll have something that wo nt cure it but will reliably halt cancer so that a patient can just wait for the actual cure to be found  as with we do with hiv i believe  maybe i m being too optimistic  but you got ta be optimistic about something in this miserable world,1,

72712,i have my own super secret private social network site that only i know about,6,
72713,so  i read the article and it appears the site was not created by anonymous but anonymous advocates the site  i believe facebook could use some healthy competition  though i question how private anyone s information can be on the internet  even with encryption it seems no matter how much you try to protect someone s information online  there is always someone who  with enough time and ingenuity  can obtain it,5,
72714,anyone else get the feeling this was an ad,4,
72715, doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  i have watched criminal minds penelope can do it,6,
72716,given the propensity of anonymous for leaking confidential and private information of people who do nt share their viewpoints  i do nt know how super private it would stay if someone expressed a contrary opinion would my belief that kanye is an immature narcissist result in release of the name and location of my virginity loss  or my 2nd grade teacher  btw  not the same person ,6,
72717,i bet tom from facebook is already a membe,3,
72718,gt  but unlike its competitors it doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  so how does it make money to pay for development  management  support  bandwidth  and servers  i do nt know how this shit gets reported slow news day  remember that stupid  social network  diaspora  they got global coverage about their facebook alternative i do nt think they ever even finished the product  let alone had anyone use it  must be built by the son of some important news editor who can drum up publicity this is likely the same,3,

72769,tl  dr  apple has to provide the means to extract encrypted data from the device fbi will then try to decrypt it  i assume by brute force  would would be easy for a 4digit pin   the interesting part is that the device is owned by farook s employer  the san bernardino county department of public health had they been following proper device protocol  they would already have administrator access to it  this was literally government property used for terrorism  and now unsearchable not due to the  encryption  boogeyman but their own ineptitude,7,
72770,gt  the judge ruled tuesday that the cupertinobased company had to provide  reasonable technical assistance  to the government in recovering data from the iphone 5c  including bypassing the autoerase function and allowing investigators to submit an unlimited number of passwords in their attempts to unlock the phone apple has five days to respond to the court if it believes that compliance would be  unreasonably burdensome  so it sounds like the government does nt think apple can bypass it for them  just make it easier for them to brute force i bet judge s ruling will hold up  too,4,
72771,i have this hunch that this is all for show and that the fbi has access through the nsa to all of this stuff why would they cancel prism  it s not like your average citizen can inspect the electronic infrastructure of this country and verify that  for example  metadata collection has stopped i think after edward snowden they sat in a room and decided to keep doing it and act like they were stopping it i would  i sound like a conspiracy theorist but i really do think the risks of terrorism are so great and siphoning data so easy that they re still doing it,1,

72819,isps do nt actually want to spy on their customers like that it costs more money to put systems in place to do so and to maintain and operate those systems on top of that  it will only bring them bad press that could piss off customers  cox is basically saying  fuck you i m not taking a significant financial hit to spy on our customers so you can sue them and make money for yourself  they are doing the right thing  and the right thing also happens to be in their best business interest,9,
72820,good guy cox  not selling out their customers  they actually have super reliable internet no outages in any of my apartments so far,9,

72822,that s nice  but i m still going to run a vpn,8,
72823,all in all i ve been pretty happy with cox as an isp i ve used them in two different cities and it s always been reliable and fast i pay for 300mbps service and always get those speeds  usually higher almost no outages they re putting in 1gbs service in many of their cities right now  including mine  my biggest gripe with them is they have a soft data cap of 2 tb for my tier they do not enforce the caps at all but the fact that they exist means they are probably toying with the idea and there would be nothing to stop them from going evil since they are a monopoly like every other major isp it s like a benevolent dictatorship  http  wwwspeedtestnetmyresult5089441276 that s with a netflix stream going on in another room right now,9,
72824,this must be a new thing many a year s ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did nt even know what that was  none of us knew what that even was and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi,7,
72825,i ve been really happy with cox for an isp both personally and professionally here in okc personally  out of nowhere they bumped my at home connection from 15mbit to 100mbit and my bill  went down  30  all out of nowhere  without me saying a word internet is always up  not throttled  and they have decent support if it s needed  professionally at my job i ran in ip phone deployment with them for our main office  3 satellite offices they were there 100  of the way i have personal names and numbers to call in the event of issues outside of the scope of my support as the companies it admin  and when we ve needed someone on site to climb a pole for instance their longest response time was 45 minutes  i know this sounds like rhailcorporate but the fact is out of all the isps i ve had  comcast  qwest  charter  etc  they ve been the best that s not saying they should nt and could nt be better  but they re angels next to the others  in fact they proactively contact me at work every once and awhile to check on things which i greatly appreciate and they bring us cookies every month yes  our isp brings yes cookies no  we re not a big company 9 employees they re just nice,8,
72826,basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum,8,
72827,i used to work for cox in the field and inside cox did have a department that would monitor massive down loading and uploading but they did away with it shortly after i got there  within a year cox ca nt afford to lose customers right now so it s no surprise they are nt allowing this if they did then they would go out of business from customer loss i survived their huge layoff and realignment,5,
72828,this is nothing new from cox i have had cox internet for over 10 years and worked for them a few years ago they have always had this attitude toward it s customers the customer pays for internet access  cox provides internet access they do nt even enforce data caps  at least in oklahoma   i have received a few emails due to using so much data suggesting that i switch to a business plan to maximize my speed  but have never been charged extra or cut off due to exceeding a data cap,7,

72832,i ve had them as an isp for several years and they re excellent i did have one month where i went over my allowed bandwidth limit  300 gb on a 50 mbps down plan   and all i got was an email saying  do nt do that again   no throttling or charges or anything on 100 mbps down plan right now and i usually get 110 at least they re great  come out to me if i m having internet trouble that s not solved by online support  etc pretty good basically  i love cox and i m very satisfied with how much i get,3,
72833,unrelated but i could nt stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox,3,
72834,i am a proud supporter of cox,3,
72835,where are all the penis jokes,3,
72836,not as nice as it sounds if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do nt catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status  eg that they do nt have any liabilityresponsibility for what people use their pipe for   most carriers are  very  vested in not being the internet police,3,
72837,i m guessing that if they had a way to monetize it and add to the bottom line  they d be very supportive,3,

72839,cox is actually a familyowned business one of the major interest holders is a 96 year old woman who inherited from her father  she had been running it with her sister until her death in 2007   i happen to think they re one of the leastshady isp and cable providers out there  they also own the travel channel  which is a pretty great channel,5,
72840,i thought this was talking about jesse cox,4,
72841,i work for cox corporate in a startup tech company  and this makes me so happy  btw  they re just as decent an employer as they are an isp compan,3,
72842,cox is spying like a champ  rest assured you have to be quite innocent or high on meth to think they have nt supplied info to big brother and his little brothers  and will not in the future,3,

72853,almost every single person in my area that has gone to atamp  t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable  they have some shit with them but it s far less shit than others,1,
72854,they re my isp and even though they re the only isp in my city besides att and verizon  they ve been awesome,1,

72858,between cox and cable one in both places i live  i actually like our midwest internet providers i feel bad for people getting rammed by twc and comcast we ve paid  45 for 100mbps for several years  which sounds way better than the horror stories i hear from you guys,1,

72882,the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison,5,
72883,are they only being killed for food  that s slaughter  if they are being killed for management purposes  that s called culling,7,
72884,it s population control  hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use,6,

72914,this is a pretty typical mugging the mugger aggressively asks you a question  and regardless of your answer they either beat you or ask for money sometimes it s shit like  do you care about the homeless   and if you say  yes  then they aggressively ask for money and if you say no they get upset and threaten you and say you are a liar if you say no  they threaten to beat you or they just get violent either way  you are going to end up giving them your walletmoney another common one is asking you for a cigarette if you do nt have any  they will accuse you of having one and not giving it to them because of some stupid reason  racism  greed  etc  and then get aggressive and demand money for a pack of cigarettes whenif you pull out your wallet they will just grab it and walk away or beat you and run  i was on a bus and had a guy ask for my cell phone to make a call  when i said no  he said i was a racist because i assumed he was going to steal it made a big scene and stood up and got in my face and started slapping my head until i gave him the phone then he got off the bus  same principle with this happens all the fucking time if they get caught they usually say shit like  oh he gave it to me  i did nt steal it  scumbags only reason this one made the news is because it was a war vet,9,

72917,from the daily caller article  gt   i believe this was a hate crime and i was targeted because of my skin color   marquez told the dcnf  too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the main stream media refuses to report on it  woah there racist  only black people can be the victim of a hate crime  now take your beating and shut the hell up about these underprivileged disadvantaged teen youths,8,
72918,i m sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case,8,

72927, do black lives matter if you do nt agree we ll beat and rob you   and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement,8,
72928,i would like to remind everyone that bernie sanders has aligned himself with and defended the black lives matter movement in many of his speeches he talks about sandra bland  michael brown  eric garner and in typical fashion blames racism and the white establishment sanders never once mentions the blacks that are home invading in indianapolis  kansas city  atlanta  etc he never once talks about the blacks that have shot at and killed police  most recently a 19 year old black man shoots an officer in mississippi black lives matter and politicians like sanders are waging that the future will be less white and in that future you folks can imagine who will be the most vile and racist  edit  from today  white house tweets shoutout to grammy winner of best rap album  still no word on recent spate of cop killing,9,
72929,let s see if this gets labeled as the hate crime it very clearly is  who am i kidding  that wo nt happen,8,

72962,if the proposal came from a doctor or scientist  i would be 100  on the side of this bill but it comes from a senator  which makes me want to question it  scientific papers require peer review from the most qualified people to call bullshit on an idea before you can get it published as legitimate i m not saying i m questioning the idea  but i do nt know enough about the process of bills and laws to give it my automatic seal of approval  i think it s a good idea to administer anesthesia to an unborn human that can feel pain whether or not it increases the cost of abortion but the cost is still a talking point all i can do is hope that the people in charge of the decision in the end have the same concerns that i do,8,
72963,i mean  we already use anesthesia on fetuses when performing surgery in the womb for exactly this reason  so it s hardly surprising  http  wwwdoctorsonfetalpaincomfetalpaintheevidence5documentatio,7,
72964,wether a fetus is under anesthesia is completely dependent on the type of anesthetic being performed any general anesthetic also anesthetizes the fetus while other types like spinal or local do not even then  there is no accurate way to quantify or measure awareness in fetuses  much less adults undergoing anesthesia the body also still responds to pain under anesthesia  as its an autonomic response  so the definition of  feeling pain  is not something that should be measured i feel like awareness  which is impossible to measure in a fetus regardless  is a real idicator of humanity an easy solution would be to simply do all elective abortions under general anesthesia  which may cost more  but is easily doable i have no idea what the preferred method of anesthesia is  if any  for elective abortions  source  i do anesthesia in a catholic hospital,5,
72965,i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them,7,
72966,they have nt decided at what point of gestation this would happen  gt  montana lawmakers passed a similar law in 2015 requiring fetal anesthesia before surgeries  including abortion  after 20 or more gestational weeks  so  4 months the general consensus for viability outside the womb is around 6 monthsish for some the concept of consciousness coincides with viability outside the womb,6,
72967, this is a review on fetal pain   http  jamajamanetworkcomarticleaspx  articleid  201429amp  resultclick  1  from clinical review  although it is 10 years old it says  gt  evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques similarly  limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion,5,
72968,is nt this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor s office  would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder,5,
72969,ignorant people propose bill based on said ignorance,,
72970,i m going to talk about this as delicately as possible i  genuinely  want thoughts and opinions on this subject  i am asking that no one become immediately offended by what i m about to say rather than respond with your opinion telling me why you believe that my view should change i am childfree i do nt want kids  i m 35  so it s pretty much set in stone at this juncture in my life i do nt see myself as a prolife or prochoice supporter and the reason for that is because i kind of agree with both sides on one hand i firmly believe that the destruction of a human being  born or not  is murder it fits the definition  of  murder before you downvote me into oblivion  let me be clear it s not the votes i care about it s that you understand where i m coming from even though i have that belief  i also believe that some people were just not meant to be children but therein lies another debate  why do nt they place it in adoption  because most of the time unwanted children are kept  they re not placed into adoption and when they re kept their chances of being neglected as children  whether it be mentally  emotionally  or physically  rise exponentially i certainly would nt want to have a child and resent it i  do nt  have children because frankly i m mean as a damn snake i do nt see any part of me that could ever have a child and not lose my temper with it and i would nt put a kid through that  because  i  was put through that i would be a horrible parent  anyway  i have a point i swear if you re going to have an abortion  why anesthetize it first  do i believe that it can feel  absolutely  but you re killing it i mean it s not like you re putting it to sleep and saying   here  fight for your life  you re fucking killing it so why have a crisis of conscience about it  again  i m sorry if i offend anyone  that s not my intention i m just a realistic person and it is what it is sugarcoating it does nt change it the bill seems like a waste of time and tax dollars  edit  i do nt understand why this is being downvoted so  please  give me your views instead of leaving me wondering because if there s something i m not understanding it needs to be made clear again this is absolutely not about the votes rather than having a discussion,,

72991,gt  but unlike its competitors it doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  so how does it make money to pay for development  management  support  bandwidth  and servers  i do nt know how this shit gets reported slow news day  remember that stupid  social network  diaspora  they got global coverage about their facebook alternative i do nt think they ever even finished the product  let alone had anyone use it  must be built by the son of some important news editor who can drum up publicity this is likely the same,3,

73024,there s a great documentary on netflix called  high profits  about a business in breckenridge  co right before full legalization took effect  one of the big issues was exactly this only being able to do business in cash from payroll to paying city taxes they had  120k in cash they had to just walk into the front of the city building with and that was just the first month alone  some of the people that make the drops to the shops are walking out with  10k in their pockets and no security at all it s terrifying,8,
73025,civil forfeiture time,6,

73030,are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money,4,
73031,this war on cash is such bullshit  people carried cash until 12 years ago and it was perfectly fine  now they are trying to restrict flying with cash  purchasing with cash  seizing cash   the only problem is that the money is due on one day  they need to have the tax office take payment on any day of the week  so it s stacked,6,
73032,i wonder how negative interest rates  if implemented  would effect the marijuana business these value of the business would probably increase as they had large sums of cash on hand their credit worthiness would increase because they had something of value  cash  but they would be penalized for depositing that cash according to the recent imf working paper i wonder if they would become attractive targets for some banks to help capitalize their weak balance sheets,3,

73067,okay  i m not american  but did nt the senate legalise homosexual marriage  so is nt this unconstitutional,1,
73068,allowing people to do what they want with their own property is nt antigay  it s profreedom and proequality the right to follow your on conscience is as fundamental as the right to follow your own gender identity equality under the law is as far as laws should go,1,
73069,can anyone say hillbilly,,
73070,i have 2 problems with this a  fair and equal treatment isnt a right hate to say it  but people are assholes would i refuse to serve someone based on some character trait  no is it still my right to refuse to serve anyone i dont like  assuming that it s my buisiness   you bet your ass it is it s not a smart buisiness plan  but the law doesnt require that i be smart b  how the fuck would someone know that youre gay  i mean  sure some people might fit every single stereotype  but that doesnt mean that they are gay unless they specifically ask  are you gay  and you reply  yes  i am homosexual   which again  is not required by law   how would they be able to destinguish your sexuality  this whole bill is just too messy for my likin,,
73071,man  why do the people who run this state have to be such major assholes,,

73077,because america loves her servicemen and women so she wants them to help themselve,8,
73078,i have been calling the helpline everyday for 2 weeks it is a recorded message saying call back later we are busy just then general va helpline,7,
73079,the problem with the va  like most other government agencies  is that there is no accountability when you ca nt fire workers who are lazy  negligent  or worthless  you end up with a disfunctional organization filled with lazy  negligent  and worthless people,7,
73080,yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country,4,
73081,i have a pretty easy solution  why do nt overflow suicide calls just get forwarded to the regular suicide hotline  s   sure its probably better to deal with someone specifically trained to deal with service men and women but anyone is better then a voicemail,6,
73082,that vm box is gon na get overloaded quic,3,
73083,pissing off trained military personnel seems like a dumb idea in the long ru,3,
73084,and sanders wants to make this available for everyone it s not the money that causes this agency to be this way it s the nature of the federal government,4,
73085,it is nt a secret that the va is understaffed that is the biggest issue with the va and if they had more funding for labor costs  they would be in a far better spot,1,
73086,i ve been getting this for over a month the one time i did connect  the estimated wait time was 55 minutes,1,
73087,started up telepsyche again trying to make some progress a pending appointment looms  and i am very much looking forward to it  until she calls me and tells me they re cancelling it  i get a couple of appoints out of them  and then someone is sick  or changes positions there s no way for me to develop a healthy trusting relationship with my therapist  this is not an effective way to heal  so fuck it i ll go till i burn out in a glorious explosion of give a fucks and poop,1,
73088,remember when the va story broke it was really big news and everyone was talking about it and it was front page on reddit  nothing s changed  stories keep coming out about how nothing s changed  but no one cares either because it s not new anymore  or because of politics  or maybe both i do nt know,1,
73089,can anyone explain why the va is so dysfunctional  in short  i do nt get it it seems like they have tons of money but ca nt get their shit together,1,
73090,tell me more about how universal healthcare will be awesome for the rest of us,,
73091,socialized healthcare no thanks,,
73092,governmentrun anything is a disaster,,
73094,if the proposal came from a doctor or scientist  i would be 100  on the side of this bill but it comes from a senator  which makes me want to question it  scientific papers require peer review from the most qualified people to call bullshit on an idea before you can get it published as legitimate i m not saying i m questioning the idea  but i do nt know enough about the process of bills and laws to give it my automatic seal of approval  i think it s a good idea to administer anesthesia to an unborn human that can feel pain whether or not it increases the cost of abortion but the cost is still a talking point all i can do is hope that the people in charge of the decision in the end have the same concerns that i do,8,
73095,i mean  we already use anesthesia on fetuses when performing surgery in the womb for exactly this reason  so it s hardly surprising  http  wwwdoctorsonfetalpaincomfetalpaintheevidence5documentatio,7,
73096,wether a fetus is under anesthesia is completely dependent on the type of anesthetic being performed any general anesthetic also anesthetizes the fetus while other types like spinal or local do not even then  there is no accurate way to quantify or measure awareness in fetuses  much less adults undergoing anesthesia the body also still responds to pain under anesthesia  as its an autonomic response  so the definition of  feeling pain  is not something that should be measured i feel like awareness  which is impossible to measure in a fetus regardless  is a real idicator of humanity an easy solution would be to simply do all elective abortions under general anesthesia  which may cost more  but is easily doable i have no idea what the preferred method of anesthesia is  if any  for elective abortions  source  i do anesthesia in a catholic hospital,5,
73097,i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them,7,
73098,they have nt decided at what point of gestation this would happen  gt  montana lawmakers passed a similar law in 2015 requiring fetal anesthesia before surgeries  including abortion  after 20 or more gestational weeks  so  4 months the general consensus for viability outside the womb is around 6 monthsish for some the concept of consciousness coincides with viability outside the womb,6,
73099, this is a review on fetal pain   http  jamajamanetworkcomarticleaspx  articleid  201429amp  resultclick  1  from clinical review  although it is 10 years old it says  gt  evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques similarly  limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion,5,
73100,is nt this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor s office  would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder,5,
73101,ignorant people propose bill based on said ignorance,,
73102,i m going to talk about this as delicately as possible i  genuinely  want thoughts and opinions on this subject  i am asking that no one become immediately offended by what i m about to say rather than respond with your opinion telling me why you believe that my view should change i am childfree i do nt want kids  i m 35  so it s pretty much set in stone at this juncture in my life i do nt see myself as a prolife or prochoice supporter and the reason for that is because i kind of agree with both sides on one hand i firmly believe that the destruction of a human being  born or not  is murder it fits the definition  of  murder before you downvote me into oblivion  let me be clear it s not the votes i care about it s that you understand where i m coming from even though i have that belief  i also believe that some people were just not meant to be children but therein lies another debate  why do nt they place it in adoption  because most of the time unwanted children are kept  they re not placed into adoption and when they re kept their chances of being neglected as children  whether it be mentally  emotionally  or physically  rise exponentially i certainly would nt want to have a child and resent it i  do nt  have children because frankly i m mean as a damn snake i do nt see any part of me that could ever have a child and not lose my temper with it and i would nt put a kid through that  because  i  was put through that i would be a horrible parent  anyway  i have a point i swear if you re going to have an abortion  why anesthetize it first  do i believe that it can feel  absolutely  but you re killing it i mean it s not like you re putting it to sleep and saying   here  fight for your life  you re fucking killing it so why have a crisis of conscience about it  again  i m sorry if i offend anyone  that s not my intention i m just a realistic person and it is what it is sugarcoating it does nt change it the bill seems like a waste of time and tax dollars  edit  i do nt understand why this is being downvoted so  please  give me your views instead of leaving me wondering because if there s something i m not understanding it needs to be made clear again this is absolutely not about the votes rather than having a discussion,,
73103,if you pinch a fetus it will cry so that pretty much proves they feel pai,,
73104,because that makes it okay  smh,,
73106,just wait until they get their   1495 outage restoration surcharge  on the next bill,9,
73107,comcast   so what  it s not like you can leave me,9,
73108,comcast is used to pissing people off they wo nt give a fuck,9,
73109,you could probably just sticky this post  have no link from it or replies available that is how permanent of an issue this is,9,
73110,we want google fiber and we want it now,9,
73111,if a telephone company has this large a problem  they have to meet with the fcc and show cause most likely there would also be a hefty fine but  not cable networks because they are deemed nonessential,7,
73112,not news to me i have a 3 hour outage at least once a month with comcast a 1020 minute outage daily around 56 am  and at least 34 10 minute outages sprinkled throughout the week  i know this because 2 out of every 5 or 6 dvr recorded shows are fucked up during the middle   absolutely awful i live in a moderate city  too  so it s not like i m in the middle of fucking nowhere,7,
73113,and then they wonder why people are ready to go to google fibe,7,
73114,loss of internet and television access for 3 days would cause mass panic and riot,8,
73115,my bad people i went over my 300gb and used way too much of an infinite resource,7,
73116,wow  17k outages nationwide for as much as 3 hours  obama needs to step in and fix this for sure ,9,
73117,gt  across us i bet i could find thousands who are angry at comcast  in my town alone ,5,
73118,i m fully expecting to get downvoted to hell here  but what the heck  i m not particularly fond of comcast  but unless i missed something here  which is entirely possible   this does nt actually sound like it was particularly horrific for people in general it sounds like a very small fraction of their nationwide customer base  had an outage of parts of their service for about 3 or 4 hours  not even all of their service  but things like they could nt access their hd channels  or their internet did nt work for a few hours  i understand for businesses  an internet outage can be a big deal  so some outrage on their part would be justified  but for the general consumer  come on  get a grip go read a book for a while  or go outside for a bit  or  gasp  go do something with your family  i m just not getting what the huge deal was here  what am i missing,7,
73119,i was part of the outage did nt have internet and only had access to about 8 sd channels i ll be honest  3 hours where i have to use my phone for internetsi could nt care less had to go out and shovel anyway  edit  couldgt  could n,7,
73120,not a fan of comcast  but with this outage they probably still provide 9999  uptime bunch of whiners  yes  i work in it,6,
73121,i like how this is news in this country,7,
73122,comcast angers me even without outages,7,
73123,the words  anger  and  comcast  come up often,4,
73124,there needs to be legally mandated uptime and speed requirements  95  of the time your connection must reach the  advertised  speed  no more  up to xmbps  allowed  and 99  of the time it must reach 14 of that speed if this is nt met then customers must be completely refunded for that month,4,
73125,is anyone else still completely fucking down  just everything  been down for 15 hours here,4,
73126,quote from the article   comcast has more than 27 million customers  and 89000 of those are new cable subscribers the company signed on last quarter that was its best performance in eight years  correct me if i m wrong but are nt there 2 choices for most people  sign up with comcast or do nt have high speed internet  it s like bragging because people choose to eat food from the only supplier rather than starve to death,4,
73127,comcast seems to be an isp that people love to hate  charter got so bad for so many years that i loved to hate them in all honesty  the past three to four years or so they have been great,7,
73128,customer service replied   working as intended,3,
73129,i ve had comcast xfinity for almost 2 years now and i ve never had an issue,5,
73130,fun story i was at a friend s place watching the superbowl in denver comcast blacked out cbs with 1 minute 26 seconds left on the clock in second quarter  and service was nt restored till about 15 seconds before 3rd quarter kicked off  idk how widespread this was but lots of denverites did nt get to see the super bowl halftime show i d imagine comcast would lose a lot of money if their advertisers paid to have a certain amount of views and one of the biggest markets  since denver was participating in the super bowl  cut out all views during the entire halftime show idk how their whole contract with that stuff goes though  i hear i did nt miss much though,1,
73131,that s what happens things go out sometimes,3,
73132,friend of mine called to ask why he couldnt connect  he obviously cant check if there are outages in his neighborhood without the internet  he calls them and they offer to send a tech to his house for like  80  they didnt tell him the price  but you know itd be up there  he spends an hour checking all his connections  digging through paperwork to find his modem settings page  finally calls back about 8hrs later hoping to talk to someone else and theyre like   oh yeah  there s an outage in your area   idiots,1,
73133,when i called  i was disconnected 3 times this is great customer nonservice beside the lack of tv thanks comcast for helping me make my change from you  easier,1,
73134,it s nothing new that comcast absolutely sucks,1,
73135,when you deal with technology  there is only one thing i can guarantee you it will get down at the worst possible time,1,
73136, compact angers thousands across the us for something other than just being comcast for once  ftf,1,
73137,they just put a data cap on my home internet how fucked is that  pretty fucked if you ask me,1,
73138,what is the most troubling about comcast is that when there is an outtage  it doesnt effect just a small region  but instead downs multiple states that seems so rediculous,1,
73139,once they fix the outage you re left with  comcast anger thousands across us,1,
73140,now only 1000 years to lrrr ruler of the planet omicron persei 8 comes to destroy earth,1,
73141,it s not like we re losing  that  much more bandwidth it s only like 20 megs less than what we had before which was only 80 megs less than what we re paying for,1,
73142,so  i had to get comcast recently because i moved and noticed something weird about my bill the letter in the mail has a different due date than the due date that shows up on the online account just saying folks make sure to pay 2 days before your date at least,1,
73143,just having comcast in general makes them angry,1,
73144, nsfw how comcast really feels   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  kmcny_pixdw,1,
73145,once in a while fios is out for a few hours hard to get too pissed  these things do happen i do nt think comcast needs an outage to be hated honestly though for me they were a decent provider  i never had a single issue with them except for the occasional outage,1,
73146,wow now that s comcastic,1,
73147,it was out for like 3 hours jesus christ,1,
73148,my comcast service  for the first time in years  has actually been pretty good lately but i d like to pay less  so i m rooting for google fiber to come to boston simply so i can reap the benefits of competition  i mean  that s what we really want  right  we do nt want yet another monopoly  no matter how  altruistic  we think google will be  we want the existing monopolies to be forced into providing quality service for a reasonable price  along with other choices,1,
73149,it probably still worked better than my centurylink ds,1,
73150,comcast s response   it pays the restoration fee  or else it gets the hose again,1,
73151,my case  as in many others  boils down to this  you can pay triple the amount for the same throughput speeds or you can curse comcast and wait for google fiber,1,
73152,at the same time  i would nt want to be on the other end and get screamed at from 10k  people experiencing the outage i just went out instead of being at home it s aggregating that it happens so often  at the same time there are other things to d,1,
73153,they should just switch providers if they are nt satisfied  see what i did there ,1,
73154,after this comcast will just be turning off their services everywhere after all  they could save a ton of money that way,1,
73155,for comcast  it was tuesday,1,
73156,spread your cheeks  most of you wo nt even complain or ask for a billing credit,1,
73157,title should just be  comcast angers thousands across us   i fucking hate comcast with every fiber of my being  reasons  i  paying top dollar for slow as shit internet  ii  a modemrouter combo that broadcasts an unsecured public network from your home which has to be manually deactivated  iib  said modem has to be forced reset once a week  and doing so undoes the manual changes you made to get rid of the second network  iii  arbitrary data caps  iv  live television that freezes  v  ondemand that works infrequently  and turns into minecraft porn when it crashes  vi  customer  service  that refuses to listen to what your problem is  but instead tries to upsell you on a more advanced package  one of my dreams is to live long enough to see this shit stain regional monoploy of a company implode upon itself  or be run straight into the fucking grave by google fiber,1,

73281,thats bad news for all the 711 in our town that take the,8,
73282,does nt this just translate into fewer places for poor people to buy food,7,
73283, 711 cashiers will now have to ring up cigarettes as organic kale instead of hot pockets,7,
73284,on the other hand  if the business stops taking food stamps entirely  not only can they not get the kale you want to make them eat  but they also ca nt get a loaf of bread or gallon of milk unless they start selling their food stamps to get cash to buy the milk and bread so the business still makes their money  the amount of food stamp fraud goes up  and the poor that you claim to be helping are getting even less food  healthy or otherwise  because of the food stampcash exchange rate,4,
73285,why are nt food stamps like wic  with wic you get vouchers for specific food items these items cover the basic food groups and align with a certain amount of nutritional value  meanwhile  you can buy friggin monster energy drinks with food stamps that makes no sense  regardless if you are looking at it from a healthy standpoint or a taxpayer standpoint,6,
73286,if obesity and other nutrition related issues are such a problem among the poor  would nt it be more cost effective to do away with food stamps and implement something like a food box program instead  in other words would the cost of labor to package and ship prepared food boxes in bulk to grocery stores and distribution centers be offset by what would be saved in reduced healthcare costs  imagine a program where you list the people in your household  any allergies or specific requirements and a box is prepared to supplement your family for a week it could contain things like rice  beans  canned or pouched goods like meats  vegetables and fruits  dried oatmeal and cereals  powdered milk  cooking oil every month they could receive a selection of 5 spices  salt and pepper and even a recipe pamphlet if in addition to the box  they started a program where grocery stores and produce growers could drop off older or bruised produce  people could pick some up for free when they picked up their boxes,7,
73287,what if the healthy foods do nt sell  are they still forced to stock them  would nt you think the actual grocers in the neighborhood would have a better sense of what their customers want than the federal government,4,

73291,honestly this will be great  the state  should  be very involved in what people eat for free,1,
73292,another  good intention  bad policy,1,
73293,this is the dark side of welfare  the constitution is completely circumvented the government has the power to cajole and pressure when it is putting stipulations on the money it gave out the government is capable of doing things it would never have the power of doing otherwise  like forcing a business to carry certain products  or forcing a person to apply for jobs or eventually  forcing people to work at government labor jobs,1,
73294,because dontravious demands fresh cilantro,3,

73310,the entitlement attitude of so many americans  gt  if it was me  i would have probably escorted this procession to the burial  your funeral escort was driving without a valid license the chp was correct to pull him over and cite him the rest of the funeral procession was free to continue on but you chose to pull over instead that was your own decision that caused you to be late the funeral  what is so aggravating to me about this is the family will file a lawsuit and probably win they will get to think they are right but they will milk the taxpayers of thousands of dollars,1,

73330,fry needs to weigh in here  http  imgurcomgvji0u,6,
73331,to be clear  the fact that she refused a breathalyzer is important in many states it is treated as evidence of impairment and justification for arrest she knew that i have many friends who are criminal defense attorneys and all have told me they advise to refuse breathalyzer always  unless there is a court order  i m not familiar with ny law  but i can pretty much guarantee she will not be convicted of dui if middle classcollege kids can get out of them  a federal judge surely can since it said nothing about a field sobriety test  i assume they either did nt administer one  or they did and she did not meet criteria for impairment,5,

73407,itt  out of staters have no fucking idea about the current state of economics in detroit and how great this project is going to be for the city  i do nt even know where to begin with this article it s clear the author did nt talk to a single person in the city or state or even try to get a feel for the public opinion on the topic including garbage clickbait phrases like the previous article titled  detroit scam city  how the red wings took hockeytown for all it had  has to be one of the dumbest fucking things i ve ever read  when detroit was at its absolute rock bottom worst  going to joe louis arena was probably the only reason suburban white people would ever go into the city and spend money now mike ilitch wants to build a gigantic urban development project including restaurants  shopping stores    apartment complexes   and oh yeah a brand new stateoftheart arena for one of the most successful hockey teams of all time  they have nt missed the playoffs since before i was born  25 years ago they are a big deal and have been for decades   oh  and it s being built at the exact time there s an influx of young people and new businesses into the the city which will create more upward momentum  yes  the city is helping pay for it the city also got a lot of input on it design  layout  and what additional projects would be built along with the arena this happens in every single city an arenastadium is built i do nt necessarily think that s how it should work but the fact of the matter is that this is how these deals are made and the city absolutely needs projects like this if it wants to continue on its upward trend  also attacks on mike ilitch in this article and this thread are disgusting illitch has been a controversial figure for a long time but his story is like example of the american dream you d see in fiction his parents were poor immigrants  he grew up in detroit joined the marines played minor league baseball for the team he now owns opens up a mom and pop pizza place and creates an empire out of it  gets rich while creating jobs and doing public works projects for the city he grew up in even though it s a complete shit hole mike ilitch has been spending  and yes  making  money in detroit for years mike ilitch was there in the 90 s and early 00 s before there was ever a housing crash in the rest of the country the man is nt a saint but if it were nt for him there would be a lot less charities and projects being invested in now he wants to build a project the city desperately needs with the city s help and input  and he s getting shit on by some dumb ass  journalist  that ca nt get their facts straight  endran,7,
73408,someone call charlie leduff,5,
73409,good old cronyism at its finest  nothing new to detroit at all,5,
73410,i wonder if journalists really think this is breaking news,3,
73411,where is my surprise face,3,
73412,a city official operating at a congressional level,3,
73413,gt  detroit contractor who negotiated  285 million in public money for the red wings now works with red wings owner so  i love how these headlines are supposed to make us feel outraged,4,
73414,same shit happened here in richardson  texas  a suburb of dallas   the mayor brought in a huge company to the city and then left office to get a job with that same company it also turns out she was having an affair with a guy from that company too,3,
73415,stop giving public money let business deal with business  not government  which can only be scammed and lead to corruption and bloated monopolies promote free market  and separation of power,3,
73416,to be fair  he was working with him then too,1,
73417,i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him,1,
73418,conflict of interests everywhere,1,
73419,this is how it worksthere is nt anything new to this story that is nt happening in nearly every major city and state across the country  i do nt like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it,1,
73420,public money  om,1,
73421,wow  you mean so someone who worked very closely with an organization and built relationships decided to work for said company later on in their career  shocking  i tell you,1,
73422,everyone from the owners to the safety and comfort of the city and everyone thinks this whole plan is going to a country that did not mainly speak my language  i would learn it,1,
73423,what a shocking surprise,1,
73424,well that s convenien,1,
73425,in other news  bears do  it turns out  shit in the woods,1,
73426,can we just start an embarrass the fuck out of these greedy punks campaign,1,
73429,how do i get one of these fuck around on the internet jobs,9,
73430,because twitter has been such a phenomenal business succes,9,
73431,gt  luckie  s new role will entail working with media organizations  as well as government organizations  to understand how they  re currently using reddit and what their needs are from the platform  luckie told me he  ll then take that feedback and build it into reddit  s product  with the goal of making reddit more accessible to a broader community of people  so reddit will listen to what they like and dislike and then hand feed us whaat they want us to hear no longer will it be us posting what we find interesting and up or down voting it for exposure as much as it is meant to be  that s what i am hearing just another nail,9,
73432,gt  the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do nt we have that subreddit already ,8,
73433,will this have an impact on integrity within certain front page  news related  and default subs concerning submissionsdeletionsetc,5,
73434,so more sponsored posts too bad voatco is such a shitty alternative,8,
73435,the entire article talks about his race  reddit  you are a disappointing piece of shit,7,
73436,i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites,7,
73437,so is his job to come around and censor our posts,6,
73438,great  now reddit is stealing other people s diversity hires  jesus  there really is just no oc on this site anymore  is there,6,
73439,just as a precaution  i think we all should be putting on our life jackets,6,
73440,does this dude give off  profitability  pixie dust when he walks around the office  what is causing all of these companies  reddit  yahoo  twitter  vox  salon  mashable  github  gawker  etc  in decline to try and make up for shitty business practices with diversity hires  it does nt matter how many black activist and feminists you hire  that wont solve a lack of profitability and coming from a company that tanked  and you were suppose to be part of the solution  is nt exactly a gold star on your resume you are suppose to jump ship from companies that are failing not get on board,7,
73441,aka manipulator in chief,5,
73442,so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming and this was the great marketing that is killing them,6,
73443,that seems like quite a comedown  with all due respect to this fine institution,3,
73444,let s see what shitty changes they come up with 144 character limit  perhaps,4,
73445,it s about ethics in reddi,3,
73446,just read about how twitter is filtering political content of a particular kind good news for reddit  they re on their way to being another propaganda wing of the left,1,
73447,great  a news manager  amp  head of journalism  with the attention span of one sentence  and the intellectual depth of a drunk on a 24 hour train ride  note  reddit is a whore for anything that emanates out of the roman catholic ponzi generating pope s pie hole perhaps the new head of journalism  could find another criminal organization to support on reddit instead of the catholic church criminal empire,,
73449,as a disgusting crime as this is  i do hope real investigative work ishas been done children are easily led and will answer questions often the way the interviewer asks it i remember a daycare couple who had a witchhunt waged against them  almost running their lives because the parents just knew they had to had been molesting their kids then they would ask the kids did mr x touch you there and the kids would say yes,9,
73450,at least the article refers to this as a rape  rather than a  relationship  or  incident  like lots of others do,8,
73451,why does the stock image of a gavel have a link to buy it printed on a mug  like  is anyone going to read this article and be all like  that s a nice gavel picture  i d like to drink coffee out of it ,5,
73452,do nt witch hunt this woman deserves a fair trial you ca nt always believe the stuff that comes out of a child,9,
73453,i ca nt even imagine how messed up in the brain you have to be to do something like this i hope the boy can get past this and recover thoughts and prayers to him and his family   stay strong buddy,8,
73454,i always wonder what the fuck is going through people s head when they do this 7 year olds just are nt attractive they re cute  they incite caring instincts  they do  not  incite sexual feelings what has to be wrong with you to feel that,8,
73455,sentenced to 20 dollar fine,5,
73456,i m more disgusted with argusleadercom i mean seriously  how many hoops do you want a person to jump through to see the text on your shitty little page  close the subscription popup  close the social media slider  what s this google survey popup that renders all of the text as underscores until you fill it out  nope fuck you  your story  and your webpage,8,
73457,i am confident that six months of probation she will receive will be difficult for her ,9,
73458,i ca nt fucking believe the people posting here defending this woman in a reversed situation there d just be people calling for his head and wishing he get killed in prison instead we re treated to people trying to find some way to defend or deflect the situation  wtf a boy gets raped and people think what   hurr well maybe he did it ,7,
73459,but women cant rape men,1,
73460,if she only waited five more years in some states they would sentence that 12 year old to child support payments,7,
73461,holy shit the comment section here,7,
73462,wooooooooo south dakota made the front page  fuck  for awful reasons again,3,
73463,if the victim was 14  the jury would be hung  as the victim is actually way below the age of puberty  she ll be fried,5,
73464,holy crap  they actually called it rape,6,
73465,i do nt understand  i thought women could nt do this  maybe those college classes on how not to rape should include women,6,
73466,not one comment about how she should be killed or have a train run on her in prison double standards so glaring it s like staring at the su,5,
73467,women dont go to jail as much as men for the same crime it s disgustin,5,
73468,judge is going to come down on her hard with 6 months probation i guarantee,3,
73469,if she had gotten pregnant would she have been able to sue for child support,5,
73470,itt  people who do nt understand statistics or sarcasm,3,
73471,what the actual fuck is wrong with people  not the people in this thread  but this alleged pedo fucking a 7 yr old,1,
73472,i do nt know what template or system backs websites like this one  but fucking dammit does it suck,1,
73473,yeah  no way they indite he,1,
73474, i present the culprit   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  hgjdxskiqa,1,
73475,let s see what she looks lik,1,
73476,i hope he siouxs her ass off,1,
73477,andddddd i doubt she  ll get hardly any time or punishmen,,
73478,excuse me  women  can not  rape men  because the patriarchy means that men are always more powerful and always in the wrong   even when  it s an innocent little kid this lady should get off scot free        ishouldnthavetoputthisbut,,
73479,through that child rapist in prison for life and throw away the keys  right ladies  lo,,
73480,why is this front pag,,
73483,thats bad news for all the 711 in our town that take the,8,
73484,does nt this just translate into fewer places for poor people to buy food,7,
73485, 711 cashiers will now have to ring up cigarettes as organic kale instead of hot pockets,7,
73486,on the other hand  if the business stops taking food stamps entirely  not only can they not get the kale you want to make them eat  but they also ca nt get a loaf of bread or gallon of milk unless they start selling their food stamps to get cash to buy the milk and bread so the business still makes their money  the amount of food stamp fraud goes up  and the poor that you claim to be helping are getting even less food  healthy or otherwise  because of the food stampcash exchange rate,4,
73487,why are nt food stamps like wic  with wic you get vouchers for specific food items these items cover the basic food groups and align with a certain amount of nutritional value  meanwhile  you can buy friggin monster energy drinks with food stamps that makes no sense  regardless if you are looking at it from a healthy standpoint or a taxpayer standpoint,6,
73488,if obesity and other nutrition related issues are such a problem among the poor  would nt it be more cost effective to do away with food stamps and implement something like a food box program instead  in other words would the cost of labor to package and ship prepared food boxes in bulk to grocery stores and distribution centers be offset by what would be saved in reduced healthcare costs  imagine a program where you list the people in your household  any allergies or specific requirements and a box is prepared to supplement your family for a week it could contain things like rice  beans  canned or pouched goods like meats  vegetables and fruits  dried oatmeal and cereals  powdered milk  cooking oil every month they could receive a selection of 5 spices  salt and pepper and even a recipe pamphlet if in addition to the box  they started a program where grocery stores and produce growers could drop off older or bruised produce  people could pick some up for free when they picked up their boxes,7,
73489,what if the healthy foods do nt sell  are they still forced to stock them  would nt you think the actual grocers in the neighborhood would have a better sense of what their customers want than the federal government,4,
73490,no they ll stop or pack up and leave  ahhhincentives,5,
73491,you can lead them to water  but you ca nt make them drin,5,
73492,we have jackinthebox here in phoenix that has we accept ebt  signs up all over pisses me off  same thing at the gas station when you see children without any parents around loading up on overpriced candy and soda and  sure enough  out comes the ebt card or even worse is when they are  with  the adult and loading up on dog shit  food stamps should only be foractual food,1,
73493,honestly this will be great  the state  should  be very involved in what people eat for free,1,
73494,another  good intention  bad policy,1,
73495,this is the dark side of welfare  the constitution is completely circumvented the government has the power to cajole and pressure when it is putting stipulations on the money it gave out the government is capable of doing things it would never have the power of doing otherwise  like forcing a business to carry certain products  or forcing a person to apply for jobs or eventually  forcing people to work at government labor jobs,1,
73496,because dontravious demands fresh cilantro,3,
73497,i wonder how much crime in a store would go down if the store was no longer food stamp approved,1,
73499,gt  purchase orders showing that the sheriff s office spent more than  60000 on barbecue grills wtf why,9,
73500,this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties the docs and comments on the forum board are searing i would imagine many itinformation systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments,8,
73501,i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever,8,
73502,cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification  one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry,5,
73503,they re public officials and public servants  appointedhiredelected we re entitled to see what these records are  without exception,8,
73504,as much as i m for police transparency  i m not for their home addresses being out there that puts their families and neighbors at risk,8,
73505,i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered,8,
73506,anything worth even looking at in this release,3,
73507,do nt know why they re concerned  surely they have nothing to hide ,5,
73508,if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear,1,
73509,good anytime somebody s falsely charged with shit their life is dragged through the mud in the papers  let the pigs have the same,,
73510,you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings,1,
73511,notice that hackers never dox the 01   billionaires sponsoring hillary clinton  etc,1,
73512,you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced  well fuck it no more police and no more rules    fucking stupid juveniles,,
73513,umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops there s hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops,,
73516,i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic,9,
73517,for those unaware  he is one of the marines who carried sgt major kasal out of the fallujah  hellhouse  it is  in my opinion  one of the most iconic photos of the iraq war this photo  https  iimgurcomtezsn9zjp,9,
73518,i live in dc groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day never makes the news public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do nt know what they are doing worst part it s never anyone who will fight back not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 1315 but they have seriously injured folks in the past brain damage and internal bleeding i typically avoid groups of young black men now i feel a little bad about it like i m being racist but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted,9,
73519,another article with some details  http  dailycallercom20160215marineallegedlyassaultedmidburgeratmcdonaldsasgangyelleddoyoubelieveblacklivesmatte,9,
73520,this is why i support gun ownership,8,
73521,inb4 this thread gets nuked by the mods,9,
73522,not only did they assault a veteran with a deadly weapon  they used his credit cards at locations should nt be too tough to find them fuck these kids,8,
73523,this is a pretty typical mugging the mugger aggressively asks you a question  and regardless of your answer they either beat you or ask for money sometimes it s shit like  do you care about the homeless   and if you say  yes  then they aggressively ask for money and if you say no they get upset and threaten you and say you are a liar if you say no  they threaten to beat you or they just get violent either way  you are going to end up giving them your walletmoney another common one is asking you for a cigarette if you do nt have any  they will accuse you of having one and not giving it to them because of some stupid reason  racism  greed  etc  and then get aggressive and demand money for a pack of cigarettes whenif you pull out your wallet they will just grab it and walk away or beat you and run  i was on a bus and had a guy ask for my cell phone to make a call  when i said no  he said i was a racist because i assumed he was going to steal it made a big scene and stood up and got in my face and started slapping my head until i gave him the phone then he got off the bus  same principle with this happens all the fucking time if they get caught they usually say shit like  oh he gave it to me  i did nt steal it  scumbags only reason this one made the news is because it was a war vet,9,
73524,pieces of shit who ve done nothing but take from societ,8,
73525,i hope that the assailants rot in prison,7,
73526,from the daily caller article  gt   i believe this was a hate crime and i was targeted because of my skin color   marquez told the dcnf  too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the main stream media refuses to report on it  woah there racist  only black people can be the victim of a hate crime  now take your beating and shut the hell up about these underprivileged disadvantaged teen youths,8,
73527,i m sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case,8,
73528,lock these shitheads up and throw away the ke,8,
73529,black lives do matter these teens  lives  however do not,9,
73530,every fucking time a cop shoots a black guy  justified or not  we have people like obama telling us we have to do some  soul searching  and when cities like dc and baltimore  i live around both and can personally attest that shit like this happens all the time and is usually never reported  and detroit and new york and such have this shit happen  it s a non issue  fuck all of it  trump 201,8,
73531,do white lives matter to blacks,6,
73532,i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold  it s really political blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims  and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws  and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm  how much power do the sjws really have  will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution,8,
73533,and people try to tell me that what celebrities do and say is not important at all on some level  in some instances it is  this is the movement beyonc  tried to shove into everyone s face at the superbowl just remember that,8,
73534,best optionavoid dc because it s a shit hole,7,
73535, across the street from the fbi headquarters,6,
73536, do black lives matter if you do nt agree we ll beat and rob you   and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement,8,
73537,i would like to remind everyone that bernie sanders has aligned himself with and defended the black lives matter movement in many of his speeches he talks about sandra bland  michael brown  eric garner and in typical fashion blames racism and the white establishment sanders never once mentions the blacks that are home invading in indianapolis  kansas city  atlanta  etc he never once talks about the blacks that have shot at and killed police  most recently a 19 year old black man shoots an officer in mississippi black lives matter and politicians like sanders are waging that the future will be less white and in that future you folks can imagine who will be the most vile and racist  edit  from today  white house tweets shoutout to grammy winner of best rap album  still no word on recent spate of cop killing,9,
73538,let s see if this gets labeled as the hate crime it very clearly is  who am i kidding  that wo nt happen,8,
73539,i do not think that black lives matter more than anyone elses if anyone else does  they do nt understand what equality is fuck blm,8,
73540,i need to start carrying my gun more often i have my ccw  but rarely do i carry because i dont see the need i just acquired it because its my right to have one,7,
73541,what s weird this is nt a bad part of dc at all given  any mcdonald s you go to in this city is likely to be crawling with some of the world s worst  but still,6,
73542,yeah beating a man and robbing him is a surefire way to get your point across right,6,
73543,black lives matter is to racial equality what isis is to islam both these groups attract those who wish to have power over others  not to enlighten others i hold both in low esteem,7,
73544,the sooner they get recognized as the terrorists that they are  the sooner they can be dealt with with boots in their necks,8,
73545,do black lives matter or do all lives matter,7,
73546,black lives matter  to who,8,
73549,gt  90 percent of government revenues are from oil  70 percent of working saudis are employed by the government  and even the private sector remains heavily dependent on government spending  haha that about sums up the structural problem right there,8,
73550,maybe they could rent themselves out as maids to rich philippinos,8,
73551, my grandfather rode a camel  my father rode a camel  i drive a mercedes  my son drives a land rover  his son will drive a land rover  but his son will ride a camel,8,
73552,disaffected youth gon na be disaffected,8,
73553,i have spent some time among the government arab workers of these nations and i have no pity for the trials that lie ahead of them in the real world  they wielded their unearned wealth with a brash arrogance  putting themselves above other races with a disgusting assumption that they were somehow favored by god  and therefore inherently better than others in fact  it was equally distasteful for them when an american did  not  wield their racenationality with a pompous arrogance because this undermined their own claim to legitimacy  this was not some single unpleasant person i dealt with it was the overwhelming majority out of 100 citizens  there were maybe 5 people who had enough wisdom and openmindedness to question such an absurd world view  for example  on a hot day i was supervising pakistani and indian workers doing our manual labor for us  as it would have been unbecoming for an arab and an american to be doing manual labor i took some of our cold water bottles we had in our cooler and offered them to the workers  but was stopped by one of the head guys  do nt do that   he warned me shaking his head his message was clear  he did nt want the workers to get used to that treatment  i witnessed minorities berated and even physically accosted at times only americans and british were spared from the cruel racism that pervades the arab world it seeps into your daily life and if you live in it long enough you even start to internalize it ugh  i am looking forward to the cold splash of reality to wash over that region and wake many of those intolerant people up from their slumber,7,
73554,get ready for a lot of afluenza,7,
73555,saudis in general are incredibly lazy had 7 in my mis program every single one flunkedgot booted from their groups for overall laziness  ask any iraqmiddle eastern stationed vet what they think about saudi officers lazyapathetic  never had to earn anything,7,
73556,gt  our main issue is that our university did not prepare us for the job market  gt  they  d get out of university and get a government job now you need an advanced degree  til us millennials are not the only ones that got a kick in the pants by the generation before them  however  the saudis did get their education for free  edit  punctuatio,7,
73557,have done some research in saudi echoing similar things everybody wants government jobs  but the government is trying to push private sector employment  so you end up with many saudis who do nt do anything showing up on payrolls and there s a somewhat true perception that most companies would prefer to hire foreigners  who will work harder  over citizens  not sure what the longterm solution is for the employment problems  but crashing oil revenue is definitely going to make things worse will be interesting to see if government is going to start shrinking public sector employment more heavily,5,
73558,syriana is a really good movie  imo,5,
73559, what about us braindead slobs ,4,
73560,could nt happen to a nicer group of religious authoritarians,5,
73561,i m sure this will turn out well for regional stability,3,
73562,this reminds me of gundam 00 s setting  where fossil fuels have become depleted and the world moved on to better and more efficient sources of energy  which resulted in countries overly reliant on oil exports plunging into poverty,1,
73563,sounds like us in alberta  canada,1,
73564,there is place for cockroaches but not too many  it s like a big pile of garbages enabled a small tribe to explored into a hoards,1,
73566,its really a shame that this is even nessesar,9,

73570,may god bless him he is a true patriot spend the money for the future generation through the preservation of our national treasures,9,
73571,how many hellfire missiles would that buy,8,
73572,this is a great thing people who are bashing him do not make much sense the monuments in dc are one of the united states  greatest treasures  and likewise they cost a lot to maintain let alone refurbish they are a public venue that is traversed by millions and are awesome to each person that visits  this guy decided to use some of his money to give back and better public places that reside in our nation capital and some see him as an asshole  it is one thing to be bitter about not having that kind of money  it is another thing to get pissed when someone with money gives back,7,
73573,its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring,3,
73574,good for him i remember the lincoln memorial being one of my more favorite monuments i d like to take my son there some day  so it s nice to see it will be upgraded and fixed up  to all the naysayers and negative commenters  fuck you,5,
73575,in this thread hooray  what an awesome guy and  also fuck him  he should have used pennie,6,
73576,how is he a philanthropist  he s giving money to statues  not to people maybe he s a philstatuist,5,
73577,congratulations  you just bought  18 million worth of  charity shaming   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  aksowj8agwo ,3,
73578,how dare that onepercenter not keep that money to themselves it s as if they are nt evil like sanders wants you to believ,1,
73579,i think it s great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about what i do nt like is that there should nt even be an issue with funding for our monuments,4,
73580,if we re committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i m all for it,1,
73581,i wonder how many huge donations like this  maybe smaller  in the hundreds of thousands  have been made for national monuments pretty awesome someone did this wo reading the article  i have to imagine there s a good amount of rigmarole on the donor s end to ensure the donation goes to where the donor actually wanted govt accountability on any level in the us seems kind of weak lately,1,
73582,all right  a 15000sqft exhibit room underneathkind of like the one in fallout ,3,
73583,can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too,,
73584,oh cool thanks  philanthropist guy,3,
73585,wow  what an honorable thing to do  while 99  of people in his position would spend the money on useless crap  this guy chooses to spend his money on something so selfless and so much bigger than himself  this guy is a good 1  e,,
73586,it d be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro,1,
73587,that s nice for a full on rapist to do,,
73588,let s laugh at people in need by blowing tens of millions on nonessential shit that basically benefits nobody in any significant way  edit  and get tax breaks from it too,1,
73589,no matter what some peasant is going to whine rich guy should ve just kept his money to himself and these poors would nt even know  i thank him  i ll go to dc eventually the whiners here probably could nt afford any type of vacation  or if they could  only by living paycheck to paycheck,,
73590,we are living in a new gilded age,,
73591,i certainly appreciate what david has done here but  with all due respect to david  most americans would rather not see financial industry groups  like the carlyle group  suck economic resources out ofaway from most americans instead  we d prefer to pay for these efforts through widespread  robust economic opportunities and the tax contributions they make possible millions of americans and this nation have been greatly diminished as a result of the business activities of groups  like the carlyle group  over several decades  because of grotesque incomewealth inequality  the odds of seeing successful businesspeople like david rubinstein are greatly diminished he only got where he was because of the social ladder that used to exist in this nation,,
73592,how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions,,
73593,it s gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface themfight to take them down,,
73594,those goddamn rich people are at it again  dammit if we could only find a way to tax away their wealth so we could spend it on poorly negotiated deals for mediocre roads and bridges,,
73595,wow  what a waste of money,,
73596,fixing stupid shit is hardly philanthropy,,
73597,i m pretty sure there are roads around there that could have used that money  priorities  people,,
73598,because republicans refuse to pay for it from fed budget ,,
73599,congratulations  you just bought  18 million worth of  charity shaming   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  aksowj8agwo ,,
73600, 18 million  that could have stopped about 6000 kids from dying of malaria   http  wwwgivewellorginternationaltopcharitiesamf  costperlifesaved   one man s philanthropist is another man s guy who does nt see the big picture,,
73603,i hope they left quietly after looking in the window  they might enjoy this over at rwalkingdea,4,
73604,pfft  what  really  happened was that the onduty cops did nt have cable at their station so they watched it through the windows,4,
73605,we also fire up the surround sound amp when the walking dead comes on  but we do nt keep any windows open i wonder if the propane bomb scene is what triggered the 911 cal,4,
73606, a show about firearms  more like a show about a group of survivors of a zombie apocalypse but whatever,4,
73607, it was the tee vee  i m sorry it disturrrbed you now it s rather late   nurse diese,1,
73608,is nt it heartwarming how tv can still bring the whole family together,1,
73610,has nt he already had  like  two years to prevent this in the first place,7,
73611,lansing has actually dealt with this problem and their civil engineers have a solution which is both fast and more costeffective than traditional measures they connect the end of the new pipe to the old pipes so when they pull out the old pipe they simultaneously thread the new pipes into the existing space this speeds up the process and the people in lansing estimate with adequate training  involving them with the process in flint  and hiring enough crews it can be completed for flint in one year,7,
73612,this whole situation is a national embarrassment  and it makes my blood boil  but what does naacp have to do with city water  is it a race issue as well  i ve never seen the demographics on flint  come to think of it  maybe aspca should get involved  too i bet people are still feeding their pets city water no matter what  edit  i just think it should be about officials   doing their fucking jobs    framing it as a race issue might just come back to bite us  who knows how many towns are discreetly checking for  and finding  elevated lead  should it matter how many african americans live there  if so  how should officials proceed differently  will it result in a process of public relations triage  that prioritizes black communities  public officials just need to do their fucking jobs for the public they serve there s no need to complicate this with race,5,
73613,that s like threatening to get one of those online white house petitions going it does nt matter,1,
73614,fix flint s water pipes or they ll burn flint to the ground,3,
73615,i m all for getting this fixed as quickly as possible but i also do nt want something rushed either figure it out figure it out right,1,
73616,okayand then what  all of the protesting has nt done jack so far what s one more protest going to do  it s not going to make the state government move any faster  it s very clear that the government  at every level  is more concerned about covering itself a protest is nt going to change that,,
73617,sooooo glad i do nt live in flint  that place sounds like a complete disaster,,
73618,who the fuck are they to demand this  are whiteasianlatino people not allowed to be affected by this,,
73620,the majority of colorado is not going to be happy about this,3,
73621,reasonable safety concerns the awareness that comes from these discussions trumps the the annual event,,
73623,so not only are these disputed  there are now long term  long range weapons on them,1,
73625,living in germany and studying  i m gon na pay 300   335   for the upcoming semester  these 335  also includes a public transportation ticket  which is in your student id  that allows me to take the train  bus  tram etc at any time as much as i like in my entire state  books are nt nearly as expensive as in the us  the most expensive book i bought last semester was 80   89    but  seriously  95  of the content for the majority of the courses are uploaded on the university s website  files and documents which you can download for free  also  the university canteen offers you decent food for a fair price  normally around 35   in the end my biggest expenses during my semester are the coffees i buy on campu,9,
73626,i m from the uk and have lived in germany for 6 years now i came here with a 20000 gbp student loan for a 4 year degree in computer science  now i m about to start a masters in web science that will cost me about 1000 eur for the 2 year course  parttime and remote  i m also just about to get german citizenship  most germans are happy to speak english  i have a job here and although most of the company speak english they make i point of speaking german with me  and i with them  i m not very good at german but am slowly learning now after 5 years of being very lazy about learning the language it s a very hard language to learn  screw those articles   but in time you ll get used to it  i absolutely love speaking to locals in german and being understood by them  to me it s like being on another planet and finally being accepted by the local populus  good luck to anyone who wants to come over  it is a wise move  come and see me near koblenz,9,
73627,a friends son went to college in switzerland  we are american  even though he paid additional fees as a non native  and had to travel back and forth to europe  he still paid less than kids who went to local colleges,9,
73628,come gather around the fire and listen to a tale of a spooky and simple explanation of our increasing tuition rates in the us  the government started giving student loans kids take the debt  the schools get the money tuition prices increase because they can rely on the kids to get a gov loan take away student loans  then schools ca nt rely on this money  kids ca nt afford the jacked up tuitions  enrollments drop  schools are forced to cut tuition  now more affordable again it s the same problem with mortgage crisis  just a different industry,9,
73629,it s almost as if germany sees the benefit of having a well educated work force that is not bogged down by insurmountable debt,9,
73630,my college actually sodomizes me,9,
73631,whereas here in the states  they will gladly charge you a  250semester parking fee and you will still not actually be guaranteed a space,8,
73632,maybe i should go to germany,9,
73633,currently living in germany  as an american student on an international internship  what this is nt telling you is that the uni system is significantly different my roommates  all in engineering or other sciences  study all day every day they have a month of exams coming up  and they usually have only one exam per year you fail that  you fail no assignments  projects  etc  just that exam  did i mention this was a fraternity  yeah  they do nt go to uni because everyone does it  like america they work  they get accepted  and they work even more it is nt for partying  it is nt for meeting your spouse or friends  it s for becoming the best you can be  which is how a university should be  good luck to the americans coming here thinking it s anything like the states enjoy the d  ner,9,
73634,something like this gets posted everysingleweek without fail and then a bunch of americans start making hasty decisions to just go study in germany because it s  free   oh and it has been this way for years so it is nt a new thing  the german courses that you will have to take for at least a year to reach fluency are around  300 a month and noduolingo is absolutely not enough to get you to the level you need to study at university  the fees for applications are at  75 then an additional 15  for each university you apply to after the first it can go well into the hundreds  the bank account you have to open for your student visa has to have a frozen amount of at least approx   8500 this is nt to say it is impossible but do nt expect roses and rainbows and raining beer amp  wurst to await your easy university life in germany  also american universities except the few ivy leagues or outstanding schools  baby the absolute shit outta you you can pretty much sail smoothly your first two years while you get your core courses out of the way in germany  you jump right into it in german remember  a different language a crazy  difficult language at that the high school diploma is also not equivalent to the german one that allows you to study at a university the equivalent would be a plethora of ap courses with really good grades or a high school diploma plus two years of college with really good grades and then you re equivalent to a german high school graduate  you will also most likely not be able to transfer credits  german bureaucracy  a bitch you will have to have german knowledge when applying for your visas or someone to be a translator there with you  you may have to do a prep year for certain programs as well it is also very competitive to get into even these programs  i sound like fucking scrooge but i ve been through all of it as so have many people i met along the way  it is possible but it will take a lot of hard work and dedication and time that you wo nt regret  losing  because it may not work out perfectly you may get rejected you may not be accepted for that semester a lot of the popular programs have a cap so it s very restricted in terms of amount of students accepted  do nt expect germany to be a country that is just waiting and fiddling its thumbs for the americans to come and study in their unis for  free  and think that they re gon na make it easy for you it is anything but,9,
73635,my american husband started learning german at the age of 26 a year later he was admitted to vet school here he s almost finished now we ve been paying 120 euros a semester i think he s the only foreign student to not drop out in his class though the drop out rate is high even for germans while he s happy he is debt free  the immense stress of having to learn a very hard subject in a foreign language and a foreign system  bureaucracy is insane here   have caused many panic attacks and one major case of depression and he has nt even started the huge final exam yet but at least we wo nt be  200k in debt when this is over,8,
73636,the fee is actually 150500  per semester books inclusive because of librarys and because we live in 2016 and share digitaly public transport also free  you get 600  per month plus health care  if your parents arent rich  this will be checked by government  as student  and will have to pay back   half of that   in worst conditions after you finished  also  after 3 semesters you must have passed 23 of your finals at any time to get your  baf  g  money  but this will only be checked once no money for extra semesters of course,9,
73637,in my opinion let them come here  let them study here and let them stay here if they want besides the fact that the ones who stay make up for the cost of education it is a great way of cultural exchange  it s always nice to have friends from different countries  so if you are coming to the area of n  rnberg just text me ,8,
73638,currently living in duisburg  germany and studying at the university of duisburgessen   my choice   i grew up in the us  but my parents are from germany after graduating high school it became apparent that studying in germany was an opportunity that i could not pass up i chose my current uni because it has an international studies in engineering program which allows me to pursue a bachelors degree in computer engineering with the first year taught entirely in english   costs   the costs are definitively low the semester fee  including public transport  is below 300   my total living expenses are below 700  a month and that includes health insurance   my experience so far   keep in my mind i m still in my first semester  as others have mentioned before  the majority of students quit after the first year last year  the failure rate of an exam taken by 200 students was over 95   attending lectures is completely voluntary and there is one exam at the end of each course that makes up 100  of your final course grade no homework is given and you are very much on your own forcing yourself to focus and learn everyday can be a serious challenge  feel free to comment or pm with any questions,7,
73639,many american students also come with very false expectations about what german university is like you have to be way more self organised and please do nt expect multiple choice tests,9,
73640,we need to stop this immigration because when america sends its people  it sends unskilled people and we have to spend our money on them we are going to build a wall  get america to pay for it and make germany great again,9,
73641,you can only offer something for free if you limit supply fewer germans go to college than us students   only 30  of germans ages 2534 have completed a tertiary education  which includes academic degrees and some but not all vocational programs that  s below the oecd average  and below the us 45  attainment rate for the same age group  http  wwwlatimescomlocaleducationcommunitylameedufreecollegeeducationingermanybutnotincalifornia20151029htmlstoryhtml edit  so now i am amused that many people are suggesting that fewer people should go to college in the us  presumably other people  not so much themselves they are smart   it seems like this would be a less popular proposal than promising free tuition,9,
73644,the county commissioner who spearheaded the public sales tax for the bengals and reds stadia now works for the bengals,9,
73645,let the  14 dollar beer flow,8,
73646,corruption of public officials in michigan  no way,9,
73647,i certainly do nt necessarily agree with public funds being used for a sports stadium  and i definitely do nt agree with nepotism  but i think criticizing mike illitch somehow taking advantage of detroit is a shortsighted mistake had it not been for mr illitch pretty much singlehandily reinvesting in a city everyone wanted to leave behind over the last 20 years  the city would nt even be close to back on a path to relevancy  whether you want to believe it is or not   the other thing to consider is that this new complex not only brings commerce to an area that was a combination of blight and open fields  it also brings quite a few jobs to the city  as well as some stateoftheart buildings that will bring commerce and international travelers to the area for a variety of reasons  conferences  concerts  etc   this all equals more money for the city of detroit  which is why they re willing to make the investment in the first place   and another part of a blightfilled neighborhood updated and usable for the future  this is a sticky situation that reeks of an unfortunate quidproquo  but when it comes to what is good for the city of detroit  it s hard to argue that anyone has anything on the passion and dedication of mike illitch,9,
73648,how in the fuck are there no comments about the red wings owner s hair  ,9,
73649,everyone talks about the insanity in pro sports these days  yet no one mentions  public or private  universities  which are all nonprofit  spending massive amounts of their cash on stadiums  athletic facilities  etc it s the same thing if the universities are public  and its only marginally different if they re private the reason they have that money in the first place is federallysubsidized student loans,8,
73650,lol illitch has done more for the city of detroit than any other person in the last 50 years fuck off,9,
73651,so he did a good job for the team and the owner offered him more money for a better job  happens all the time  kids,6,
73652,is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit  or ford field  most people would not step foot downtown if it was nt for those two places i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do nt bring forth revitalization like intendedbut the only article i ve read was about stadiums in la and sf,6,
73653,before you jump on the  why ca nt detroit use the money for things that actually matter  train   here s   http  wwwcrainsdetroitcomarticle20140921news309219990oncostfinancingofwingsarenahereareanswers  an article outlining the finances of this massive project  edit  s  for those not wanting to click  gt  the initial base price is  450 million problems  changes and added amenities could increase that final cost anything beyond  450 million must be paid by the ilitches  gt  the michigan strategic fund will sell  450 million in two series of bonds they will be divided into  250 million in series a bonds that will be backed by property taxes already captured by the downtown development authority the  200 million in series b bonds will be backed by the  115 million olympia development has agreed to pay the dda for bond retirement  gt  the ilitches  through olympia  will pay  200 million of the bond debt detroit s dda  via its property tax capture ability  will pay back  250 million of the bonds new yorkbased merrill lynch  a division of bank of america  which has pledged to buy all the publicly backed series a bonds in the deal it will then sell the bonds to the public dallasbased comerica bank inc will buy the series b bonds backed by olympia s money the bank  formerly based in detroit  has the naming rights to comerica park  where the ilitchowned detroit tigers play comerica intends to keep the bonds on its books rather then sell them,8,
73654, misleading title   https  wwwredditcomrhockeycomments45xs0mdetroit_contractor_who_negotiated_285_million_ind00vnke   it was state money  not detroit s also  ilitch footed most of the bill himself  or through his company   please research  the district  and see their plans for it before passing judgement,9,
73655,clickbait no one around here is remotely upset about taxpayer funds going to a new stadium for the most popular team in town we re not really unhappy about the new development for business and residences that is happening and we re not raising any concerns about the effort to revitalize the city  detroit is climbing out of a hole created by the corruption of influential individuals local business and leaders have been more beneficial in this process than any other group and this stadium  and the district surrounding it are seen as victories in this effort,8,
73656,ah  a local spin on the old  congressperson becomes lobbyist  setup,5,
73657,they are literally building new district for the city not just an arena  a whole new district development is what the city needs and frankly  detroit politics have always been just a  wee  bit corrup,4,
73658,but  guys  come on we need our circuses  what would we do with out national sports  concentrate on real issues  lol  that s no fun ,4,
73659,at ohio state  the man whole negotiated the deal to sell its parking rights to a private company  campusparc  left to work for them after it was signed,4,
73660,you think that s a wig,4,
73661,public money should never be allowed to pay for sports teams unless the team has to pay back the city directly  with interest none of this but businesses will benefit  bullsht it s my fucking money you re stealing  i do nt want to  potentially  subsidize businesses downtown,8,
73662,if you re a bernie supporter  who thinks a public funded  1 trillion dollar infrastructure package is a good deal because jobs  but is outraged by the state of michigan investing  285 million in the renovationrevitalization of its  largest city  then you might want to reexamine one of those positions,6,
73663,for all the people complaining about spending the money on the new stadium and  less mentioned  surrounding developments  all i can say is it will be more than worth it if it fixes up that area governments of all levels have been dumping money into the cass corridor since the early days of johnson s great society programs with any luck this will finally be a solution that stick,7,
73664,itt  out of staters have no fucking idea about the current state of economics in detroit and how great this project is going to be for the city  i do nt even know where to begin with this article it s clear the author did nt talk to a single person in the city or state or even try to get a feel for the public opinion on the topic including garbage clickbait phrases like the previous article titled  detroit scam city  how the red wings took hockeytown for all it had  has to be one of the dumbest fucking things i ve ever read  when detroit was at its absolute rock bottom worst  going to joe louis arena was probably the only reason suburban white people would ever go into the city and spend money now mike ilitch wants to build a gigantic urban development project including restaurants  shopping stores    apartment complexes   and oh yeah a brand new stateoftheart arena for one of the most successful hockey teams of all time  they have nt missed the playoffs since before i was born  25 years ago they are a big deal and have been for decades   oh  and it s being built at the exact time there s an influx of young people and new businesses into the the city which will create more upward momentum  yes  the city is helping pay for it the city also got a lot of input on it design  layout  and what additional projects would be built along with the arena this happens in every single city an arenastadium is built i do nt necessarily think that s how it should work but the fact of the matter is that this is how these deals are made and the city absolutely needs projects like this if it wants to continue on its upward trend  also attacks on mike ilitch in this article and this thread are disgusting illitch has been a controversial figure for a long time but his story is like example of the american dream you d see in fiction his parents were poor immigrants  he grew up in detroit joined the marines played minor league baseball for the team he now owns opens up a mom and pop pizza place and creates an empire out of it  gets rich while creating jobs and doing public works projects for the city he grew up in even though it s a complete shit hole mike ilitch has been spending  and yes  making  money in detroit for years mike ilitch was there in the 90 s and early 00 s before there was ever a housing crash in the rest of the country the man is nt a saint but if it were nt for him there would be a lot less charities and projects being invested in now he wants to build a project the city desperately needs with the city s help and input  and he s getting shit on by some dumb ass  journalist  that ca nt get their facts straight  endran,7,

73672,stop giving public money let business deal with business  not government  which can only be scammed and lead to corruption and bloated monopolies promote free market  and separation of power,3,
73673,to be fair  he was working with him then too,1,
73674,i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him,1,
73675,conflict of interests everywhere,1,

73690,so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10 that does nt make much sense,9,
73691,how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killedhow from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human,9,
73692,one of these videos was sent to me many years ago  forwarded on a myspace page  yeah  many  years ago   they were trying to  raise awareness  when they sent it to me to help the people get caught  but all they really ended up doing was spreading that ghastly thing to more points of the internet i wo nt describe a single second of it  but suffice it to say that it s horrifying i ve never been able to remove the memory i ve been through a lot in my military career  and yet seeing a 2minute version of one of those videos was easily the most horrible thing i have ever witnessed,9,
73693,gt  brent justice  54  was convicted and sentenced monday for cruelty to nonlivestock animals  i guess justice has been served,9,
73694,i ca nt imagine the mentality of the person making it or watching it and people get off on it    who the hell sees a cat being stabbed in the eye and thinks  hey  time to get the jergens  ,9,
73695,no complaints from me but i ve noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago,9,
73696,for once  reading a story of horrifying animal abuse does nt fill me with rage this must be what justice feels like finally  an appropriate sentence so sick of people like these getting slaps on the wrist due to inadequate animal protection laws,9,
73697,i read the title then thought  hhmmm what s an animal crush video   who would have thunk it  animal crush videos are videos of animals getting crushed there goes some of the little remaining faith i had in humanit,9,
73698,psa  if for some reason you come here first  and you do nt know what crush videos are  please do nt look them up,8,

73708,i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective it was the first exposure i d ever had to this subculture  crush fetish   after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals  their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse that s all i have to say about that,1,

73719,for those of you incapable of rtfa before making racist comments  the bride and groom are actors hired by a charity to raise awareness and the 37000day statistic refers to child marriages estimated worldwide not specifically in this local area,9,
73720,gt  nearly 15 million girls  some as young as eight or nine so  some as young as eight,9,
73721,37000 child marriages every day  if that s the case why are these people shocked  surely they must see these pedo photoshoots on the reg,9,
73722,these statistics seem unreliable estimated 12 billion new child marriages by 2050  even taking the 37000 a day estimate at face value that would only get you to 500 million by 2050  i mean seriously  assuming population growth rates remain unchanged  unlikely as the rate is slowing significantly  there will only be  47 billion women born under the age of 8 by 2050 is it truly believable that a quarter of women born in the next 34 years are going to be placed into a child marriage,8,

73730,eh personally i m more concerned with men sitting with their legs spread on public transportation that s the real problem,1,
73731,at that rate the entire female population of the us would be married off in 11 years certainly 37000 child marriages a day is unsustainable or maybe it s media hype,1,

73770,living in germany and studying  i m gon na pay 300   335   for the upcoming semester  these 335  also includes a public transportation ticket  which is in your student id  that allows me to take the train  bus  tram etc at any time as much as i like in my entire state  books are nt nearly as expensive as in the us  the most expensive book i bought last semester was 80   89    but  seriously  95  of the content for the majority of the courses are uploaded on the university s website  files and documents which you can download for free  also  the university canteen offers you decent food for a fair price  normally around 35   in the end my biggest expenses during my semester are the coffees i buy on campu,9,
73771,i m from the uk and have lived in germany for 6 years now i came here with a 20000 gbp student loan for a 4 year degree in computer science  now i m about to start a masters in web science that will cost me about 1000 eur for the 2 year course  parttime and remote  i m also just about to get german citizenship  most germans are happy to speak english  i have a job here and although most of the company speak english they make i point of speaking german with me  and i with them  i m not very good at german but am slowly learning now after 5 years of being very lazy about learning the language it s a very hard language to learn  screw those articles   but in time you ll get used to it  i absolutely love speaking to locals in german and being understood by them  to me it s like being on another planet and finally being accepted by the local populus  good luck to anyone who wants to come over  it is a wise move  come and see me near koblenz,9,
73772,a friends son went to college in switzerland  we are american  even though he paid additional fees as a non native  and had to travel back and forth to europe  he still paid less than kids who went to local colleges,9,
73773,come gather around the fire and listen to a tale of a spooky and simple explanation of our increasing tuition rates in the us  the government started giving student loans kids take the debt  the schools get the money tuition prices increase because they can rely on the kids to get a gov loan take away student loans  then schools ca nt rely on this money  kids ca nt afford the jacked up tuitions  enrollments drop  schools are forced to cut tuition  now more affordable again it s the same problem with mortgage crisis  just a different industry,9,
73774,it s almost as if germany sees the benefit of having a well educated work force that is not bogged down by insurmountable debt,9,
73775,my college actually sodomizes me,9,
73776,whereas here in the states  they will gladly charge you a  250semester parking fee and you will still not actually be guaranteed a space,8,
73777,maybe i should go to germany,9,
73778,currently living in germany  as an american student on an international internship  what this is nt telling you is that the uni system is significantly different my roommates  all in engineering or other sciences  study all day every day they have a month of exams coming up  and they usually have only one exam per year you fail that  you fail no assignments  projects  etc  just that exam  did i mention this was a fraternity  yeah  they do nt go to uni because everyone does it  like america they work  they get accepted  and they work even more it is nt for partying  it is nt for meeting your spouse or friends  it s for becoming the best you can be  which is how a university should be  good luck to the americans coming here thinking it s anything like the states enjoy the d  ner,9,
73779,something like this gets posted everysingleweek without fail and then a bunch of americans start making hasty decisions to just go study in germany because it s  free   oh and it has been this way for years so it is nt a new thing  the german courses that you will have to take for at least a year to reach fluency are around  300 a month and noduolingo is absolutely not enough to get you to the level you need to study at university  the fees for applications are at  75 then an additional 15  for each university you apply to after the first it can go well into the hundreds  the bank account you have to open for your student visa has to have a frozen amount of at least approx   8500 this is nt to say it is impossible but do nt expect roses and rainbows and raining beer amp  wurst to await your easy university life in germany  also american universities except the few ivy leagues or outstanding schools  baby the absolute shit outta you you can pretty much sail smoothly your first two years while you get your core courses out of the way in germany  you jump right into it in german remember  a different language a crazy  difficult language at that the high school diploma is also not equivalent to the german one that allows you to study at a university the equivalent would be a plethora of ap courses with really good grades or a high school diploma plus two years of college with really good grades and then you re equivalent to a german high school graduate  you will also most likely not be able to transfer credits  german bureaucracy  a bitch you will have to have german knowledge when applying for your visas or someone to be a translator there with you  you may have to do a prep year for certain programs as well it is also very competitive to get into even these programs  i sound like fucking scrooge but i ve been through all of it as so have many people i met along the way  it is possible but it will take a lot of hard work and dedication and time that you wo nt regret  losing  because it may not work out perfectly you may get rejected you may not be accepted for that semester a lot of the popular programs have a cap so it s very restricted in terms of amount of students accepted  do nt expect germany to be a country that is just waiting and fiddling its thumbs for the americans to come and study in their unis for  free  and think that they re gon na make it easy for you it is anything but,9,
73780,my american husband started learning german at the age of 26 a year later he was admitted to vet school here he s almost finished now we ve been paying 120 euros a semester i think he s the only foreign student to not drop out in his class though the drop out rate is high even for germans while he s happy he is debt free  the immense stress of having to learn a very hard subject in a foreign language and a foreign system  bureaucracy is insane here   have caused many panic attacks and one major case of depression and he has nt even started the huge final exam yet but at least we wo nt be  200k in debt when this is over,8,
73781,the fee is actually 150500  per semester books inclusive because of librarys and because we live in 2016 and share digitaly public transport also free  you get 600  per month plus health care  if your parents arent rich  this will be checked by government  as student  and will have to pay back   half of that   in worst conditions after you finished  also  after 3 semesters you must have passed 23 of your finals at any time to get your  baf  g  money  but this will only be checked once no money for extra semesters of course,9,
73782,in my opinion let them come here  let them study here and let them stay here if they want besides the fact that the ones who stay make up for the cost of education it is a great way of cultural exchange  it s always nice to have friends from different countries  so if you are coming to the area of n  rnberg just text me ,8,
73783,currently living in duisburg  germany and studying at the university of duisburgessen   my choice   i grew up in the us  but my parents are from germany after graduating high school it became apparent that studying in germany was an opportunity that i could not pass up i chose my current uni because it has an international studies in engineering program which allows me to pursue a bachelors degree in computer engineering with the first year taught entirely in english   costs   the costs are definitively low the semester fee  including public transport  is below 300   my total living expenses are below 700  a month and that includes health insurance   my experience so far   keep in my mind i m still in my first semester  as others have mentioned before  the majority of students quit after the first year last year  the failure rate of an exam taken by 200 students was over 95   attending lectures is completely voluntary and there is one exam at the end of each course that makes up 100  of your final course grade no homework is given and you are very much on your own forcing yourself to focus and learn everyday can be a serious challenge  feel free to comment or pm with any questions,7,
73784,many american students also come with very false expectations about what german university is like you have to be way more self organised and please do nt expect multiple choice tests,9,
73785,we need to stop this immigration because when america sends its people  it sends unskilled people and we have to spend our money on them we are going to build a wall  get america to pay for it and make germany great again,9,
73786,you can only offer something for free if you limit supply fewer germans go to college than us students   only 30  of germans ages 2534 have completed a tertiary education  which includes academic degrees and some but not all vocational programs that  s below the oecd average  and below the us 45  attainment rate for the same age group  http  wwwlatimescomlocaleducationcommunitylameedufreecollegeeducationingermanybutnotincalifornia20151029htmlstoryhtml edit  so now i am amused that many people are suggesting that fewer people should go to college in the us  presumably other people  not so much themselves they are smart   it seems like this would be a less popular proposal than promising free tuition,9,

73805,i believe this happened as i heard this story from other news sources  but some info had to be left out or missing in the us if you owe money on a debt the personcompany has seven years to collect if they do nt the debt disappears if they take you to court and get a judgement they have ten years to collect and it can be renewed for ten more years the only way he could be arrested is if the loan company took him to court  won a judgement and then took further action to force the debtor to court this would not be something to come out of the blue,3,

73827,i have my own super secret private social network site that only i know about,6,
73828,so  i read the article and it appears the site was not created by anonymous but anonymous advocates the site  i believe facebook could use some healthy competition  though i question how private anyone s information can be on the internet  even with encryption it seems no matter how much you try to protect someone s information online  there is always someone who  with enough time and ingenuity  can obtain it,5,
73829,anyone else get the feeling this was an ad,4,
73830, doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  i have watched criminal minds penelope can do it,6,
73831,given the propensity of anonymous for leaking confidential and private information of people who do nt share their viewpoints  i do nt know how super private it would stay if someone expressed a contrary opinion would my belief that kanye is an immature narcissist result in release of the name and location of my virginity loss  or my 2nd grade teacher  btw  not the same person ,6,
73832,i bet tom from facebook is already a membe,3,
73833,gt  but unlike its competitors it doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  so how does it make money to pay for development  management  support  bandwidth  and servers  i do nt know how this shit gets reported slow news day  remember that stupid  social network  diaspora  they got global coverage about their facebook alternative i do nt think they ever even finished the product  let alone had anyone use it  must be built by the son of some important news editor who can drum up publicity this is likely the same,3,

73844,lansing has actually dealt with this problem and their civil engineers have a solution which is both fast and more costeffective than traditional measures they connect the end of the new pipe to the old pipes so when they pull out the old pipe they simultaneously thread the new pipes into the existing space this speeds up the process and the people in lansing estimate with adequate training  involving them with the process in flint  and hiring enough crews it can be completed for flint in one year,7,
73845,this whole situation is a national embarrassment  and it makes my blood boil  but what does naacp have to do with city water  is it a race issue as well  i ve never seen the demographics on flint  come to think of it  maybe aspca should get involved  too i bet people are still feeding their pets city water no matter what  edit  i just think it should be about officials   doing their fucking jobs    framing it as a race issue might just come back to bite us  who knows how many towns are discreetly checking for  and finding  elevated lead  should it matter how many african americans live there  if so  how should officials proceed differently  will it result in a process of public relations triage  that prioritizes black communities  public officials just need to do their fucking jobs for the public they serve there s no need to complicate this with race,5,

73890,i moved away from california at the end of december this helps reinforce my decision as a good idea,,
73891,this has been happening for a while now  i came to japan in 2005 for university  graduated in 2009  and i m still here i ca nt imagine ever moving back to usa life is so much better here  which i ve had a really hard time admitting until recently my fellow americans  get out if you re not appreciated there s literally a whole world out there ready to give you opportunities,9,
73893,yes please too big to fail means they are too big  period break them apart,8,
73894,this seems like a no brainer not saying it will be easy  but why ever have banks too large to fail even exist,9,
73895,absolutely agree  but it will likely go nowhere it really is nt any different than when the government stepped in and broke up atamp  t into the baby bells unfortunately  this is talk by those who have no power to enforce change,6,
73896,seems like a good move if you re too big to fail  you are clearly in violation of antitrust and monopoly legislation  surely  plus  anything that is too big to fail is clearly just a bad idea from the standpoint of a societies ability to sustain unexpected shocks and surprises,7,
73897,big banks and wall street bank elections for both parties not going to happen unless supreme court reverses  citizens united  ruling allowing corporations to donate unlimited amount of funds to politicians and political parties as long as such bribery is legal  no politician will bite the hand that feeds himher,4,
73898,this is a political talking point floated to make sanders look like an over reactor if andor when he loses the nomination this guy and his idea will disappear from sight,5,
73899,hopefully  his floating that idea wo nt end up with him floating in the river,4,
73900,kashkari  eh  so  how does goldman sachs make money off of this,4,
73901,eh  wake me when they actually start breaking them up for now this is just more idle talk,4,
73902,i guess they could nt find a picture that makes him look crazier,4,
73903,if there are any economists here  i have a question how do we know that this wo nt have the same results as breaking up telecoms  regional monopolies collude until one is more successful and one starts to fail the successful one buys the failing one then this process repeats until the most successful one is enormous again  but with writeoffs  layoffs and debts thanks to the less successful ones consumers get screwed by footing the bill for the whole failed experiment  if telecoms can do that  why would we assume that banks wo nt just do the same thing  to the effect of even more pain for consumers,4,
73904,oh hey  it s the guy who ran for california governor,3,
73905,news update  spontaneous fires erupt in rome,3,
73906,no if we break up banks or make them have more capital  they will invest less  and folks on reddit will say its too hard to get a loan the banks will now actually want to make sure folks can actually pay back the loan  and a lot of folks have no assets  and will cry its not fair   only the rich are getting the loans    since they already have assets   are you sure you want to hold banks accountable  personally  i think its a great idea  but not sure you all realize the banks will just push that accountability back on you,3,
73907,that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money,1,
73908,probably not that big of a problem anymore they ve plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 20 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become,1,
73909,looks as though he s beginning a political career as a goldman  fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him asshole,1,
73910,breaking up huge banks reduces the chance that banks will get the giant bailouts the did after 2008 failures  massive corporate welfare they will lobby hard against the potential loss of a free ride,1,
73911,godless commie socialism yes pleas,1,
73912, flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca nt fail  did anyone else see this   wtf  so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further,1,
73913,trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it,1,
73914,from my armchair  i d say that the entire banking sector needs to be deleveraged 301 leverage  or whatever it currently is  is too much slowly  over time  to prevent shocks from the deleveraging   deleverage the banks  and it would make it harder for a crisis to become systemic,1,
73915,kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying,1,
73916,kashkari was part of the paulson team that leveraged the american banking empire into toobigtofail and now that that leverage is proving to be dangerous for the survival of the one per cent kleptocrats he wants to break up the tbtf banks  geithner knew this would manifest when he used tbtf as a stopgap measure to save the synagogue of satan worshiping kleptocracy of fraudsters that run the federal reserve now that same kleptocracy wants to be bailed out once again because geithner s temporary solution has run it s course straight into the gutter where geithner amp  kashkari et al  belong  up yours  america the functional retard,,
73919,fucking sad how this was nt described as an act of terrorism i guess that title is reserved for nonchristians,9,
73920,it is sad that it closed even for a short time people like fiorina do nt give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time,8,
73921,definitely not terrorism though  just a little rampage  you know he was probably having a bad day or something,8,
73922,good for them  dont let those freedom hating assholes scare you away from your job,8,
73923,how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him,4,
73924,is carly out of the race yet  i do nt think that rightwing  fringe conartist is done riling up her terrorist sect,6,
73925,deadly rampage  was  terrorist attack  a little too onthenose,6,
73926,why does this headline say  deadly rampage  and not  christian terrorism ,6,
73927,now i m not a fan of abortions but who the hell can think to themselves i know how to stop babies from being aborted  i ll just shoot all the moms and their doctors  absolute lunatic,3,
73928,thank god its back open now we can get back to crushing fetus  heads and sucking their brains out like normal people,,
73929,on president s day   the gaul,,
73930,so  someone went on a shooting rampage and killed people in order to stop planned parenthood from killing people  but now planned parenthood is open again  and proudly killing people  well  i am glad that worked out the entire thing makes tons of sense,,
73931,pp is where there is regular deadly rampages against unborn babies,,
73932,planned parenthood is basically condoms and the oklahoma city bombing,,

73937,because america loves her servicemen and women so she wants them to help themselve,8,
73938,i have been calling the helpline everyday for 2 weeks it is a recorded message saying call back later we are busy just then general va helpline,7,
73939,the problem with the va  like most other government agencies  is that there is no accountability when you ca nt fire workers who are lazy  negligent  or worthless  you end up with a disfunctional organization filled with lazy  negligent  and worthless people,7,
73940,yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country,4,
73941,i have a pretty easy solution  why do nt overflow suicide calls just get forwarded to the regular suicide hotline  s   sure its probably better to deal with someone specifically trained to deal with service men and women but anyone is better then a voicemail,6,
73942,that vm box is gon na get overloaded quic,3,
73943,pissing off trained military personnel seems like a dumb idea in the long ru,3,
73944,and sanders wants to make this available for everyone it s not the money that causes this agency to be this way it s the nature of the federal government,4,
73945,it is nt a secret that the va is understaffed that is the biggest issue with the va and if they had more funding for labor costs  they would be in a far better spot,1,
73946,i ve been getting this for over a month the one time i did connect  the estimated wait time was 55 minutes,1,
73947,started up telepsyche again trying to make some progress a pending appointment looms  and i am very much looking forward to it  until she calls me and tells me they re cancelling it  i get a couple of appoints out of them  and then someone is sick  or changes positions there s no way for me to develop a healthy trusting relationship with my therapist  this is not an effective way to heal  so fuck it i ll go till i burn out in a glorious explosion of give a fucks and poop,1,
73948,remember when the va story broke it was really big news and everyone was talking about it and it was front page on reddit  nothing s changed  stories keep coming out about how nothing s changed  but no one cares either because it s not new anymore  or because of politics  or maybe both i do nt know,1,
73949,can anyone explain why the va is so dysfunctional  in short  i do nt get it it seems like they have tons of money but ca nt get their shit together,1,
73950,tell me more about how universal healthcare will be awesome for the rest of us,,
73951,socialized healthcare no thanks,,
73952,governmentrun anything is a disaster,,
73954,i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic,9,
73955,for those unaware  he is one of the marines who carried sgt major kasal out of the fallujah  hellhouse  it is  in my opinion  one of the most iconic photos of the iraq war this photo  https  iimgurcomtezsn9zjp,9,
73956,i live in dc groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day never makes the news public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do nt know what they are doing worst part it s never anyone who will fight back not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 1315 but they have seriously injured folks in the past brain damage and internal bleeding i typically avoid groups of young black men now i feel a little bad about it like i m being racist but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted,9,

73959,inb4 this thread gets nuked by the mods,9,
73960,not only did they assault a veteran with a deadly weapon  they used his credit cards at locations should nt be too tough to find them fuck these kids,8,
73961,this is a pretty typical mugging the mugger aggressively asks you a question  and regardless of your answer they either beat you or ask for money sometimes it s shit like  do you care about the homeless   and if you say  yes  then they aggressively ask for money and if you say no they get upset and threaten you and say you are a liar if you say no  they threaten to beat you or they just get violent either way  you are going to end up giving them your walletmoney another common one is asking you for a cigarette if you do nt have any  they will accuse you of having one and not giving it to them because of some stupid reason  racism  greed  etc  and then get aggressive and demand money for a pack of cigarettes whenif you pull out your wallet they will just grab it and walk away or beat you and run  i was on a bus and had a guy ask for my cell phone to make a call  when i said no  he said i was a racist because i assumed he was going to steal it made a big scene and stood up and got in my face and started slapping my head until i gave him the phone then he got off the bus  same principle with this happens all the fucking time if they get caught they usually say shit like  oh he gave it to me  i did nt steal it  scumbags only reason this one made the news is because it was a war vet,9,
73962,pieces of shit who ve done nothing but take from societ,8,
73963,i hope that the assailants rot in prison,7,
73964,from the daily caller article  gt   i believe this was a hate crime and i was targeted because of my skin color   marquez told the dcnf  too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the main stream media refuses to report on it  woah there racist  only black people can be the victim of a hate crime  now take your beating and shut the hell up about these underprivileged disadvantaged teen youths,8,
73965,i m sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case,8,
73966,lock these shitheads up and throw away the ke,8,
73967,black lives do matter these teens  lives  however do not,9,
73968,every fucking time a cop shoots a black guy  justified or not  we have people like obama telling us we have to do some  soul searching  and when cities like dc and baltimore  i live around both and can personally attest that shit like this happens all the time and is usually never reported  and detroit and new york and such have this shit happen  it s a non issue  fuck all of it  trump 201,8,
73969,do white lives matter to blacks,6,
73970,i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold  it s really political blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims  and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws  and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm  how much power do the sjws really have  will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution,8,
73971,and people try to tell me that what celebrities do and say is not important at all on some level  in some instances it is  this is the movement beyonc  tried to shove into everyone s face at the superbowl just remember that,8,
73972,best optionavoid dc because it s a shit hole,7,
73973, across the street from the fbi headquarters,6,
73974, do black lives matter if you do nt agree we ll beat and rob you   and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement,8,
73975,i would like to remind everyone that bernie sanders has aligned himself with and defended the black lives matter movement in many of his speeches he talks about sandra bland  michael brown  eric garner and in typical fashion blames racism and the white establishment sanders never once mentions the blacks that are home invading in indianapolis  kansas city  atlanta  etc he never once talks about the blacks that have shot at and killed police  most recently a 19 year old black man shoots an officer in mississippi black lives matter and politicians like sanders are waging that the future will be less white and in that future you folks can imagine who will be the most vile and racist  edit  from today  white house tweets shoutout to grammy winner of best rap album  still no word on recent spate of cop killing,9,
73976,let s see if this gets labeled as the hate crime it very clearly is  who am i kidding  that wo nt happen,8,
73977,i do not think that black lives matter more than anyone elses if anyone else does  they do nt understand what equality is fuck blm,8,
73978,i need to start carrying my gun more often i have my ccw  but rarely do i carry because i dont see the need i just acquired it because its my right to have one,7,
73979,what s weird this is nt a bad part of dc at all given  any mcdonald s you go to in this city is likely to be crawling with some of the world s worst  but still,6,
73980,yeah beating a man and robbing him is a surefire way to get your point across right,6,
73981,black lives matter is to racial equality what isis is to islam both these groups attract those who wish to have power over others  not to enlighten others i hold both in low esteem,7,
73982,the sooner they get recognized as the terrorists that they are  the sooner they can be dealt with with boots in their necks,8,
73983,do black lives matter or do all lives matter,7,
73984,black lives matter  to who,8,
73987,i was happier before i knew this subculture existed,9,
73988,so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10 that does nt make much sense,9,
73989,how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killedhow from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human,9,
73990,one of these videos was sent to me many years ago  forwarded on a myspace page  yeah  many  years ago   they were trying to  raise awareness  when they sent it to me to help the people get caught  but all they really ended up doing was spreading that ghastly thing to more points of the internet i wo nt describe a single second of it  but suffice it to say that it s horrifying i ve never been able to remove the memory i ve been through a lot in my military career  and yet seeing a 2minute version of one of those videos was easily the most horrible thing i have ever witnessed,9,
73991,gt  brent justice  54  was convicted and sentenced monday for cruelty to nonlivestock animals  i guess justice has been served,9,
73992,i ca nt imagine the mentality of the person making it or watching it and people get off on it    who the hell sees a cat being stabbed in the eye and thinks  hey  time to get the jergens  ,9,
73993,no complaints from me but i ve noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago,9,
73994,for once  reading a story of horrifying animal abuse does nt fill me with rage this must be what justice feels like finally  an appropriate sentence so sick of people like these getting slaps on the wrist due to inadequate animal protection laws,9,
73995,i read the title then thought  hhmmm what s an animal crush video   who would have thunk it  animal crush videos are videos of animals getting crushed there goes some of the little remaining faith i had in humanit,9,
73996,psa  if for some reason you come here first  and you do nt know what crush videos are  please do nt look them up,8,
73997,i m not saying this is nt some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder,9,
73998,who the fuck beats off to animals being killed  what the fuc,7,

74005,you can kill your spouse  drunk drive and kill 4 people  steal millions of dollars from the american people  or molest dozens of children in a church of a period of 30 years and literally get less jail time when we say we love our doggos  and kittys   we fucking mean it,6,
74006,i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective it was the first exposure i d ever had to this subculture  crush fetish   after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals  their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse that s all i have to say about that,1,
74008,as someone who just for the first time heard the term animal crush videos  i wash that i had nt something is seriously wrong with you if this is what gets you off,7,
74009,well that just ruined my da,6,

74012,if slaughter houses had glass walls  everyone would quit eating animals the cognitive dissonance in here is incredible,5,
74013,i definitely think this guy should be punished and i m glad he was punished  but it blow my mind how a guy like this can get 50 years and a pedophile or rapist can get 1020 or less,5,
74014,i do nt understand how the sicko who did the maiming and killing gets 10 years  but the man who filmed it gets 50 that woman should not see light ever again,1,

74026,good for him  football does nt have to be a concussion prone sport it started as the american version of rugby  and evolved into the form we see today  and can just as properly evolve into something that is nt effectively a form of human sacrifice  part of how it evolved is the career of pop warner  the coach of the carlisle indian school he kept  how to put it  coaching like a lawyer  and coming up with clever ways to get an edge  that would then eb slapped down with rule changes  surely concussions justify rule changes too,7,
74027,i played football for 4 years in highschool started all 4 years i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fu,3,

74050,come gather around the fire and listen to a tale of a spooky and simple explanation of our increasing tuition rates in the us  the government started giving student loans kids take the debt  the schools get the money tuition prices increase because they can rely on the kids to get a gov loan take away student loans  then schools ca nt rely on this money  kids ca nt afford the jacked up tuitions  enrollments drop  schools are forced to cut tuition  now more affordable again it s the same problem with mortgage crisis  just a different industry,9,

74054,maybe i should go to germany,9,
74055,currently living in germany  as an american student on an international internship  what this is nt telling you is that the uni system is significantly different my roommates  all in engineering or other sciences  study all day every day they have a month of exams coming up  and they usually have only one exam per year you fail that  you fail no assignments  projects  etc  just that exam  did i mention this was a fraternity  yeah  they do nt go to uni because everyone does it  like america they work  they get accepted  and they work even more it is nt for partying  it is nt for meeting your spouse or friends  it s for becoming the best you can be  which is how a university should be  good luck to the americans coming here thinking it s anything like the states enjoy the d  ner,9,
74056,something like this gets posted everysingleweek without fail and then a bunch of americans start making hasty decisions to just go study in germany because it s  free   oh and it has been this way for years so it is nt a new thing  the german courses that you will have to take for at least a year to reach fluency are around  300 a month and noduolingo is absolutely not enough to get you to the level you need to study at university  the fees for applications are at  75 then an additional 15  for each university you apply to after the first it can go well into the hundreds  the bank account you have to open for your student visa has to have a frozen amount of at least approx   8500 this is nt to say it is impossible but do nt expect roses and rainbows and raining beer amp  wurst to await your easy university life in germany  also american universities except the few ivy leagues or outstanding schools  baby the absolute shit outta you you can pretty much sail smoothly your first two years while you get your core courses out of the way in germany  you jump right into it in german remember  a different language a crazy  difficult language at that the high school diploma is also not equivalent to the german one that allows you to study at a university the equivalent would be a plethora of ap courses with really good grades or a high school diploma plus two years of college with really good grades and then you re equivalent to a german high school graduate  you will also most likely not be able to transfer credits  german bureaucracy  a bitch you will have to have german knowledge when applying for your visas or someone to be a translator there with you  you may have to do a prep year for certain programs as well it is also very competitive to get into even these programs  i sound like fucking scrooge but i ve been through all of it as so have many people i met along the way  it is possible but it will take a lot of hard work and dedication and time that you wo nt regret  losing  because it may not work out perfectly you may get rejected you may not be accepted for that semester a lot of the popular programs have a cap so it s very restricted in terms of amount of students accepted  do nt expect germany to be a country that is just waiting and fiddling its thumbs for the americans to come and study in their unis for  free  and think that they re gon na make it easy for you it is anything but,9,
74057,my american husband started learning german at the age of 26 a year later he was admitted to vet school here he s almost finished now we ve been paying 120 euros a semester i think he s the only foreign student to not drop out in his class though the drop out rate is high even for germans while he s happy he is debt free  the immense stress of having to learn a very hard subject in a foreign language and a foreign system  bureaucracy is insane here   have caused many panic attacks and one major case of depression and he has nt even started the huge final exam yet but at least we wo nt be  200k in debt when this is over,8,
74058,the fee is actually 150500  per semester books inclusive because of librarys and because we live in 2016 and share digitaly public transport also free  you get 600  per month plus health care  if your parents arent rich  this will be checked by government  as student  and will have to pay back   half of that   in worst conditions after you finished  also  after 3 semesters you must have passed 23 of your finals at any time to get your  baf  g  money  but this will only be checked once no money for extra semesters of course,9,
74059,in my opinion let them come here  let them study here and let them stay here if they want besides the fact that the ones who stay make up for the cost of education it is a great way of cultural exchange  it s always nice to have friends from different countries  so if you are coming to the area of n  rnberg just text me ,8,
74060,currently living in duisburg  germany and studying at the university of duisburgessen   my choice   i grew up in the us  but my parents are from germany after graduating high school it became apparent that studying in germany was an opportunity that i could not pass up i chose my current uni because it has an international studies in engineering program which allows me to pursue a bachelors degree in computer engineering with the first year taught entirely in english   costs   the costs are definitively low the semester fee  including public transport  is below 300   my total living expenses are below 700  a month and that includes health insurance   my experience so far   keep in my mind i m still in my first semester  as others have mentioned before  the majority of students quit after the first year last year  the failure rate of an exam taken by 200 students was over 95   attending lectures is completely voluntary and there is one exam at the end of each course that makes up 100  of your final course grade no homework is given and you are very much on your own forcing yourself to focus and learn everyday can be a serious challenge  feel free to comment or pm with any questions,7,
74061,many american students also come with very false expectations about what german university is like you have to be way more self organised and please do nt expect multiple choice tests,9,
74062,we need to stop this immigration because when america sends its people  it sends unskilled people and we have to spend our money on them we are going to build a wall  get america to pay for it and make germany great again,9,
74063,you can only offer something for free if you limit supply fewer germans go to college than us students   only 30  of germans ages 2534 have completed a tertiary education  which includes academic degrees and some but not all vocational programs that  s below the oecd average  and below the us 45  attainment rate for the same age group  http  wwwlatimescomlocaleducationcommunitylameedufreecollegeeducationingermanybutnotincalifornia20151029htmlstoryhtml edit  so now i am amused that many people are suggesting that fewer people should go to college in the us  presumably other people  not so much themselves they are smart   it seems like this would be a less popular proposal than promising free tuition,9,
74067,they do not care what police do with them  they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them  edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create  that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all  they do not care about you you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle,8,
74068,why this has 58 upvotes when some stupid shit about a teen  affluenza  case has 4000  i can not fathom priorities  people,7,
74069,where is the tipping point for police state,7,
74070,the stingray is just one of  many   https  theinterceptcomsurveillancecatalogue  devices used by our governmental police agencies against us,8,

74076,no keep turning the earths crust into swiss cheese for profit i m sure everything will be fine,1,
74077,i just think  this is our earth  our home  why are we doing this    i thought the same after reading about the abomb test it s not like we just get to build another earth  i m not just a hippie liberal douche some things are just bad ideas and a short few people making bad ideas and decisions which affect the global population negatively is scary,1,
74078,can someone eli5 me why we even need fracked oil right now when prices are projected to keep dropping,1,
74080,thats bad news for all the 711 in our town that take the,8,
74081,does nt this just translate into fewer places for poor people to buy food,7,
74082, 711 cashiers will now have to ring up cigarettes as organic kale instead of hot pockets,7,
74083,on the other hand  if the business stops taking food stamps entirely  not only can they not get the kale you want to make them eat  but they also ca nt get a loaf of bread or gallon of milk unless they start selling their food stamps to get cash to buy the milk and bread so the business still makes their money  the amount of food stamp fraud goes up  and the poor that you claim to be helping are getting even less food  healthy or otherwise  because of the food stampcash exchange rate,4,
74084,why are nt food stamps like wic  with wic you get vouchers for specific food items these items cover the basic food groups and align with a certain amount of nutritional value  meanwhile  you can buy friggin monster energy drinks with food stamps that makes no sense  regardless if you are looking at it from a healthy standpoint or a taxpayer standpoint,6,
74085,if obesity and other nutrition related issues are such a problem among the poor  would nt it be more cost effective to do away with food stamps and implement something like a food box program instead  in other words would the cost of labor to package and ship prepared food boxes in bulk to grocery stores and distribution centers be offset by what would be saved in reduced healthcare costs  imagine a program where you list the people in your household  any allergies or specific requirements and a box is prepared to supplement your family for a week it could contain things like rice  beans  canned or pouched goods like meats  vegetables and fruits  dried oatmeal and cereals  powdered milk  cooking oil every month they could receive a selection of 5 spices  salt and pepper and even a recipe pamphlet if in addition to the box  they started a program where grocery stores and produce growers could drop off older or bruised produce  people could pick some up for free when they picked up their boxes,7,
74086,what if the healthy foods do nt sell  are they still forced to stock them  would nt you think the actual grocers in the neighborhood would have a better sense of what their customers want than the federal government,4,
74087,no they ll stop or pack up and leave  ahhhincentives,5,

74089,we have jackinthebox here in phoenix that has we accept ebt  signs up all over pisses me off  same thing at the gas station when you see children without any parents around loading up on overpriced candy and soda and  sure enough  out comes the ebt card or even worse is when they are  with  the adult and loading up on dog shit  food stamps should only be foractual food,1,
74090,honestly this will be great  the state  should  be very involved in what people eat for free,1,
74091,another  good intention  bad policy,1,
74092,this is the dark side of welfare  the constitution is completely circumvented the government has the power to cajole and pressure when it is putting stipulations on the money it gave out the government is capable of doing things it would never have the power of doing otherwise  like forcing a business to carry certain products  or forcing a person to apply for jobs or eventually  forcing people to work at government labor jobs,1,
74093,because dontravious demands fresh cilantro,3,
74094,i wonder how much crime in a store would go down if the store was no longer food stamp approved,1,
74100,bison burgers bison steaks bison roasts  yum,8,
74101,the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison,5,
74102,are they only being killed for food  that s slaughter  if they are being killed for management purposes  that s called culling,7,
74103,it s population control  hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use,6,

74114,i have spent some time among the government arab workers of these nations and i have no pity for the trials that lie ahead of them in the real world  they wielded their unearned wealth with a brash arrogance  putting themselves above other races with a disgusting assumption that they were somehow favored by god  and therefore inherently better than others in fact  it was equally distasteful for them when an american did  not  wield their racenationality with a pompous arrogance because this undermined their own claim to legitimacy  this was not some single unpleasant person i dealt with it was the overwhelming majority out of 100 citizens  there were maybe 5 people who had enough wisdom and openmindedness to question such an absurd world view  for example  on a hot day i was supervising pakistani and indian workers doing our manual labor for us  as it would have been unbecoming for an arab and an american to be doing manual labor i took some of our cold water bottles we had in our cooler and offered them to the workers  but was stopped by one of the head guys  do nt do that   he warned me shaking his head his message was clear  he did nt want the workers to get used to that treatment  i witnessed minorities berated and even physically accosted at times only americans and british were spared from the cruel racism that pervades the arab world it seeps into your daily life and if you live in it long enough you even start to internalize it ugh  i am looking forward to the cold splash of reality to wash over that region and wake many of those intolerant people up from their slumber,7,

74118,have done some research in saudi echoing similar things everybody wants government jobs  but the government is trying to push private sector employment  so you end up with many saudis who do nt do anything showing up on payrolls and there s a somewhat true perception that most companies would prefer to hire foreigners  who will work harder  over citizens  not sure what the longterm solution is for the employment problems  but crashing oil revenue is definitely going to make things worse will be interesting to see if government is going to start shrinking public sector employment more heavily,5,

74155,driving drunk is not easy,1,
74156,what is 10 day weekend work release,1,
74157,at first i thought this was a reasonable charge  but when i read the article it said that she was actually driving with a flat tire most drunks are smart enough to avoid driving on a flat  this woman is an idiot and deserves a harsh punishment she was intoxicated enough to seriously endanger the lives of others  if an officer had nt pulled her over i m sure she would have caused some serious damage,,
74158,that s cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work releas,,
74159,well it s not like you can prove that she was actually intoxicated  so the fact that she was nt punished seems appropriate,,
74160,and my mom wonders why i m not married,,
74163,this makes sense a lot of people in science fields relating to cancer formation  such as radiology and medicinal biology  are of the opinion that most cancerous tumors are actually quietly killed by the body before they can reach critical mass to defend themselves  and the ones that prove dangerous are the ones that either do nt register to t cells or which grow too quickly to be snuffed to simplify  the reasons for this are simple  not everyone dies from cancer  and everyone gets exposed to carcinogens given the rate of mutation  the influence of radiation  the amount of background radiation  etc  that everyone is unavoidably exposed to  we should all develop tumors if there is a true casual relationship if you simply say that the body is helpless against them naturally  we would all die from cancer the body  must  be defending itself from them given that we do nt  in fact  it s basically accepted as scientific truth cancer is nt simply the presence of cancerous tumors  it s the presence of cancerous tumors that have the right surrounding cells  in the right quantity  that do nt die from immune system intervention and which have favorable growth conditions most small tumors simply do nt have the right conditions  and die studies have confirmed that the ones that register as cancer are a subset of all tumors that might form  because this subset avoids the usual limiting factors  so  going back to the article  this is simply taking the bodies natural process for fighting tumors and guiding it to specific cancers it might normally miss and saying  go get it   then praying you did nt just kill the poor sap with his now manically overenthusiastic immune system,6,
74164,gt  the treatment involves removing the tcells from patients  tagging them with  receptor  molecules that target cancer  and putting them back into the body in an infusionthe targeting molecules  known as chimeric antigen receptors or cars  came from specially bred genetically engineered mice   gt  in one study  94 percent of participants suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia  all  said their symptoms vanished completely after they were treated with the modified blood cells  known as tcells  it looks like this could be a very  very big deal i m surprised that  as of this comment  this post is not getting much attention,7,
74165,now they just need to find a way to reverse liver cirrhosis and i can live forever,1,
74166,this is a breakthrough right up until the pharmaceutical companies buy the process and tuck it away forever  there s no money to be made in curing a disease,1,
74167,i m rather hopeful that we ll be able to cure most cancers within the next 20 years or so  and hopefully before that we ll have something that wo nt cure it but will reliably halt cancer so that a patient can just wait for the actual cure to be found  as with we do with hiv i believe  maybe i m being too optimistic  but you got ta be optimistic about something in this miserable world,1,
74170,how do i get one of these fuck around on the internet jobs,9,

74181,does this dude give off  profitability  pixie dust when he walks around the office  what is causing all of these companies  reddit  yahoo  twitter  vox  salon  mashable  github  gawker  etc  in decline to try and make up for shitty business practices with diversity hires  it does nt matter how many black activist and feminists you hire  that wont solve a lack of profitability and coming from a company that tanked  and you were suppose to be part of the solution  is nt exactly a gold star on your resume you are suppose to jump ship from companies that are failing not get on board,7,
74182,aka manipulator in chief,5,
74183,so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming and this was the great marketing that is killing them,6,

74187,just read about how twitter is filtering political content of a particular kind good news for reddit  they re on their way to being another propaganda wing of the left,1,
74188,great  a news manager  amp  head of journalism  with the attention span of one sentence  and the intellectual depth of a drunk on a 24 hour train ride  note  reddit is a whore for anything that emanates out of the roman catholic ponzi generating pope s pie hole perhaps the new head of journalism  could find another criminal organization to support on reddit instead of the catholic church criminal empire,,
74190,fucking sad how this was nt described as an act of terrorism i guess that title is reserved for nonchristians,9,

74217,i see payday loans taking this route soon,5,
74218,did nt we get rid of debtor s prisons  i m confuse,4,
74219,i believe this happened as i heard this story from other news sources  but some info had to be left out or missing in the us if you owe money on a debt the personcompany has seven years to collect if they do nt the debt disappears if they take you to court and get a judgement they have ten years to collect and it can be renewed for ten more years the only way he could be arrested is if the loan company took him to court  won a judgement and then took further action to force the debtor to court this would not be something to come out of the blue,3,
74220,more from the professional  victim class  i guess you need something to do in between police shootings and sanders rallies,4,

74259,from what i ve read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops it looks like the taser use was justified sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca nt be deescalated otherwise  has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died,6,
74260,this is unacceptable tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are nt,7,
74261,he died 5 days later at a different hospital  clickbait headline i m sure we ll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death,6,

74270,tl  dr  apple has to provide the means to extract encrypted data from the device fbi will then try to decrypt it  i assume by brute force  would would be easy for a 4digit pin   the interesting part is that the device is owned by farook s employer  the san bernardino county department of public health had they been following proper device protocol  they would already have administrator access to it  this was literally government property used for terrorism  and now unsearchable not due to the  encryption  boogeyman but their own ineptitude,7,
74271,gt  the judge ruled tuesday that the cupertinobased company had to provide  reasonable technical assistance  to the government in recovering data from the iphone 5c  including bypassing the autoerase function and allowing investigators to submit an unlimited number of passwords in their attempts to unlock the phone apple has five days to respond to the court if it believes that compliance would be  unreasonably burdensome  so it sounds like the government does nt think apple can bypass it for them  just make it easier for them to brute force i bet judge s ruling will hold up  too,4,
74272,i have this hunch that this is all for show and that the fbi has access through the nsa to all of this stuff why would they cancel prism  it s not like your average citizen can inspect the electronic infrastructure of this country and verify that  for example  metadata collection has stopped i think after edward snowden they sat in a room and decided to keep doing it and act like they were stopping it i would  i sound like a conspiracy theorist but i really do think the risks of terrorism are so great and siphoning data so easy that they re still doing it,1,

74293,even if they wrote a program to stop the wait time or not wipe phone after a certain amount of failed attempts  you would still need to get inside the phone to implement it,3,
74294,this is what the fbi was looking for  the one terrorist case it can trumpet to prove it needs to unlock anyone s phone at any time,1,
74295,why not just dump the phones firmware and then brute force it there  learn2nsa fb,1,
74296,under what law or authority can a third party company be compelled to take some action  other than testifying  in a criminal case  can the feds order a construction company to build a house  can they order a car manufacturer to build a custom version of a car,1,
74297,this has been happening for a while now  i came to japan in 2005 for university  graduated in 2009  and i m still here i ca nt imagine ever moving back to usa life is so much better here  which i ve had a really hard time admitting until recently my fellow americans  get out if you re not appreciated there s literally a whole world out there ready to give you opportunities,9,
74302,also cars bad guys use those a lot and the internet also food,9,
74303,casinos would lobby against it a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small it would fit in a plastic shopping bag a million dollars in small bills is massive  there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash,8,
74304,how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 ,9,
74305,yeah if my big illegal bag of money was heavier  i d totally reconsider all the crime i do to obtain large bags of money it just would nt be worth the hassle,7,
74306,thank you but fuck no it s bad enough carrying around 100s to go buy cars amp  bikes on craigslist  now you want me to carry boxes of 20s   the  100 has plenty of legitimate uses  no need to make things harder for the 999  of the population that s lawabiding,9,
74307,thats why they got rid of the  500 billand it didnt work so well,8,
74308,keep marijuana and cocaine illegal  it s the 100 dollar bills that are the problem,7,
74309,i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four  5000 bills instead of two  10000 was too taxing better go straight,8,
74310,clearly  100 bills are the problem,7,
74311,people still listen to larry summers  i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008 or does cnn still think repealing glasssteagall was a good idea,7,
74312,it s not about stopping criminals it s about controlling peoples money with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically this is what done in europe to prevent  tax fraud ,7,
74313,might aswell remove any chemicals or equipment in the world that can make drugs aswell larry summers idea is stupid  it would nt just hurt criminals  it would hurt the innocent people aswell,7,
74314,in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the  100 bill it is very popular outside the us,5,
74315,the new blue  100 bills are too cool to replace,5,
74316,80  of the money supply being in  100 bills is the key statement this would likely be the first  and easiest  step to killing paper currency this is one of the initial hurdles to overcome  because they do nt give a fuck about it being tough on criminals  come on  when looking to implement negative interest rates,8,
74317,the thing about secondary labor markets  drugs  gambling  prostitution  etc  is that prohibition is what causes the main problems related to them these are black markets that will always have demand as long as the activities are forced underground by punitive policy  and that demand will always find a way around obstacles  making life marginally more difficult for the suppliers is only doing to make the products more dangerous  not less desirable,5,
74318,that is the most twisted logic   no more  100 bills  guess i ll stop dealing crack,5,
74319,okay larry last time we listened to you we deregulated the banks in 1999 nah larry  i m not gon na listen to you,5,
74320,make it illegal for poor people to ever have cash money so that you can freeze their accounts when their name shows up on the noflylist  eh  they already ca nt buy a car in cash without the dealership informing on them to the feds,6,
74321,how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds   ,4,
74322,i urge everybody here to watch inside job  it will shock you on how thoroughly corrupt this dude is  along with his buddies on wall street washington now he wants the gov to ban the  100 because of nirp  he does nt give a fuck about criminals using those or tax evasions do not listen to what this turd says,4,
74323,attention  we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash  except pennies   cash is privacy and should be a basic right,1,
74324,i wonder what larry would think about paul krugman s onetime pet project  the  trilliondollar coin   http  krugmanblogsnytimescom20130107bereadytomintthatcoin  _r  0 ,5,
74325,is something going on with all the major currencies  i saw a similar story about the euro notes too  http  wwwdailymailcoukwiresreutersarticle3448066ecbconsidersscrapping500euronotehtml also http  wwwdailymailcouknewsarticle3437590banksurgedban50notesbidendcashhandculturehelprecoupbillionstaxtreasuryhtml all these stories within a week of each other  i would nt be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency,3,
74326,currently in colorado  hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash,3,
74327,scrap larry summers  and get rid of a criminal,3,
74328,the only relevance to crime is the idea itself scam to grab more control of your money  bankster shenanigans do nt fall for it,3,
74329,the banks love this this means less people holding cash and more money that they can use to fuck us over remember folks  the rules are changing so that the money on deposit with banks is legally not yours if there s a bank failure  your money will be used to bail out the banks  the move is simply an extension of the war on cash,3,
74330,the fed stopped printing any bills higher than  100 in 1945 they began destroying the larger denominations actively in 1969  100 in 1945 is equivalent to  1300 today adjusting for inflation frankly they should be talking about issuing a  200 and  500 bill  if not also a  1000 bill,3,
74331,larry summers should be in prison  he is one of the architects of the 2008 collapse he also was instrumental in the repeal of glasssteagall the world would be better off without this fool and his dangerous ideas  http  wwwsourcewatchorgindexphp  title  larry_summer,3,
74332,does larry mean wall st criminals  of course not  white male entitlement it s what larry is all about unfortunately obama was dumb enough to bring summers into his administration where he flailed about  lamely attempting to cover upmake excuses as to why the theater burned down in 2008 with the financial  masters of the universe  still inside  larry proved his overall dumbness by predicting 2011 would be  recovery summer   based on nothing  no evidence just his  expert  opinion  there was no recovery in 2011,3,
74333,bring back the  500 and  1000 dollar bills dammit,3,
74334,larry summers  ladies and gentlemen one of the masterminds of financial deregulation is now proposing another hair brained idea summers  go clone yourself so you can go fuck yourself,3,
74335,just legalize crime everybody wins,3,
74336,fuk this illuminati puppe,4,
74337,the bulk of the value of cash in circulation is from  100 s get rid of cash and the fed can do any crazy policy it wants this is a necessary step towards negative interest rates nobody believes the government gives two shits about money laundering  florida real estate laws and hsbc getting zero criminal charges shows that is not the case,3,
74338,banksters do nt even use cash oh wait you re talking about the little criminals carry on,4,
74339,another attempt by the wealthy to outlaw cash our money is nt our money  according to the elite,5,
74340,then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination ,3,
74341,scrap the two  the single  the penny  half dollar and nickel instead,3,
74342,scrap the drugs too  make them illegal  oh wait,1,
74343,but they just click buttons on a computer and create and move money around  wait  what,1,
74344,than how will our government and cia function,1,
74345,interning theory main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks,1,
74346,singapore has had the 10000 singapore dollar bill for some time it is still legal tender  but is going to be phased out slowly old notes will not be replaced  this is a calculated strategy by the sg government to comply with international counterterrorism and anti money laundering efforts  but minimising their own vulnerability to regulatory arbitrage,1,
74347,is nt the  100 bill the staple of american foreign trade  i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like  interestfree  loans  though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ,1,
74348,politicians do nt use  100s so how could it harm criminals,1,
74349,what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then,1,
74350,gt  the  100 bill is actually the second most common us bill in circulation  behind the  1 bill  gt  nearly 80  of the  14 trillion of us currency in circulation is in  100 bills much of it is held outside the united states  i m no math magician  but this does nt seem to fit,1,
74351,yeah  just watch  they will scrap it right down to the 20  anyone who wants to make largeish purchases will have to use electronic accounts that can be tracked  oh yeah   because crime  not  because government needs to track your every move,1,
74352,this is one of those ideas that seems silly at first but the more you think of it  the more it makes some sense,1,
74353,this is stupid  criminals will make due with what ever currency there is  they do nt fucking care and any one who thinks otherwise is a desk jocky looking for something to do,1,
74354,switch to all coins while you re at it if  100 weighed an ounce   1600 would weigh a pound  1 mil would weigh 625 lbs,1,
74355,larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone,1,
74356,how would this effect the bitcoin market,1,
74357,this is about getting rid of cash  not making life tougher for criminals that way  when the fed institutes negative interest rates  you the lowly consumer will be forced to spend your savings to avoid being charged for saving,1,
74358,funny thing  today also the eu central bank ceo emanuele prodi announced that 500 euro bills are to be outphased for the same reason apparently american criminals manage to launder money with a bill that s 6 times less in value  is nt this just a global banking scheme to rob us the power over our own money,1,
74359,yes those evil people in government would love to get rid of cash and make everyone just use electronic money because then  the bank has your money and you only have an iou which they may  or may not  pay you back in the future  look at cyprus in 2013 where people did nt get their full deposited funds back because of the financial crisis  also they can charge you negative interest rateswhich means you have to pay for the bank to hold your funds  and of course if the govt has your money  then they have a great deal more power over you in deciding whether they should be nice and give it back to you or not  this is another reason why bitcoin is good  although they will ban that long before they ban cash,1,
74360,now  whatchall wan na do  wan na be ballers  shotcallers  brawlers  who be dippin in the benz wit tha spawlers,,
74361,hmm sounds like portable bitcoin exchange devices would be cool carry a bitcoin wallet in a little  5 raspberry pilike thing with an lcd display  hook it up to another  punch in transfer codes  both devices show  are you sure   both people hit yes  see the verification displayed  and bill sizes become irrelevant and everybody can keep negotiating with cash when buying motorcycles off craigslist no matter what these control freak asshats try to pull,,
74362,you can still buy silver and gold anonymously  and cash out up to  1500 worth at one time with no tax penalty,,
74363,but  but  how will weezy and drizzy write raps now if they ca nt talk about dem big faces,,
74368,can you tell florida house that please ,1,
74370, every  prepackaged shredded cheese has it it s the most common anticlumping agent used around the world the argument is that the labels said 100  cheese,9,
74371,labels should be accurate end of story if the product inside does not match the label ingredients  it is fraud and should be prosecuted as such,8,
74372,that s why you buy a little wedge of parm and use a microplane grater on it to shave cheese onto your pasta the wedge lasts a very long time  and in the end it s cheaper than the nasty jars,7,
74373,cellulose is the actual substance you ll find it in all pregrated cheeses these guys were just busted putting too much in to save    lettuce is also made of cellulose where commercial outfits get it for cheese  i guess could be just about any plant judged edible  including  sure  trees  also who knows what kind of cheese you re supposedly getting much nicer to get a hunk of the real stuff and a crank grater  my knuckles hate box graters with a passion ,8,
74374,so my penne has wood,7,
74375,so the correct labeling is 92  cheese and 8  wood filler  i think that s right,6,
74376,solution  buy your parmesan  domestic or real  and grate it yourself tastes better too if you re really lazy  grate it and freeze until you need it,7,
74377,damn were becoming like china  next will have faked food,6,
74378,what kind of wood   are we talking the high quality organic stuff  or factory processed scrap wood  because goddamnit if they ve been slipping cheap wood shavings into my welfarecheese  we re going to have an fucking issue on our hands,4,
74379,lol  wood it is cellulose trying to get clicks,6,
74380,i m safe  source  only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti,3,
74381,i shred my own parmesan cheese  it makes worlds differenc,3,
74382,this is why i do nt buy nasty sargento cheese ever taste it  it tastes like wood  i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better,3,
74383,hmm i am pretty sure i misread that title,1,
74384,it s cheaper by the chunk anyways,1,
74385,similar to olive oil  most parmesan cheese is nt even parmesan cheese,1,
74386,my parents always called it cardboard chees,1,
74387,it still taste oh so goooooooood,1,
74388,if it tastes good  i do nt care,1,
74389,pene means weiner in spanish that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood,1,
74390,maybe they are just trying to get people to eat a whole door over the course of a year,1,
74391,just buy the blockwedge and grate your own,1,
74392,gt  she faces up to a year in prison  so  what re you in for blondie    just beat me up and get it over with,1,
74393,cellulose is indeed an anti clumping agent if they use more and it does not change taste  i am ok with it at least it has less calories  ,,
74394,if you buy preshredded or grated cheese  you deserve to eat wood,,
74396,at least the guy was honest,4,
74397,i would nt be mad if it was my wallet,1,
74398,how do they know the guy was homeless,1,
74400,how screwed up would you have to be,1,
74401,i do nt understand how this happens in a state with safe surrender laws,1,
74403,funny how employers get to steal from employees  and if they are caught  they simply have to repay the employee what they are owed nobody gets charged  nobody goes to jail  meanwhile  if an employee steals from an employer  they get charged  fined  and probably spend some time in jail ditto for customers who steal  i wonder why people hate the government and rich people,8,
74404,hopefully australia has a similar thing to the usa where prisoners are paid like 47 cents per day,6,
74405,not as bad as actual slaves that work in unpaid internships,5,
74406,well  when the tpp goes through we ll all get to enjoy such working conditions  the fact of the matter is that this occurs constantly  the authorities refuse to investigate and the workers lack the leverage to bring the employers to court,1,
74407,here in the us the government would go after ahmed and not see an issue with what was going on monetarily  edit  some of you really need to step away from the computer and not take this place so seriously,,
74408,seriously why are we  the usa  importing workers on visas to work at 711s,,
74410,well  that ought to take care of the problem,1,
74411,i like that guy after all  i would only do it for the money with minimal violence  and would never want to kill people so  if i ever decide to go and work for a cartel  i m  definitely  working for el jesus,1,
74412,is he hiring mercenaries  or he has enough already  it s also not a problem to join any military  as they re all doing god s work,1,
74413,well  if their since could nt be instantly forgiven  that might have had weight,1,

74423,gt  the judge who refused to dismiss the case this month has denied cosby s appeal of that decision  so is that like asking your parents if they are really really sure that you are grounded,4,
74424,good  the prosecution seems to have a solid basis for a case this is one that should definitely go to trial the defense is going to have a tough time with all the press coverage cosby s been getting over these allegations,1,
74425,kanye tweeted cosby is innocen,1,
74427,how enforceable is this really  what do we do when we find tons of food that turns out to be from an illicit source  destroy it,6,

74540,for those of you incapable of rtfa before making racist comments  the bride and groom are actors hired by a charity to raise awareness and the 37000day statistic refers to child marriages estimated worldwide not specifically in this local area,9,
74541,gt  nearly 15 million girls  some as young as eight or nine so  some as young as eight,9,
74542,37000 child marriages every day  if that s the case why are these people shocked  surely they must see these pedo photoshoots on the reg,9,
74543,these statistics seem unreliable estimated 12 billion new child marriages by 2050  even taking the 37000 a day estimate at face value that would only get you to 500 million by 2050  i mean seriously  assuming population growth rates remain unchanged  unlikely as the rate is slowing significantly  there will only be  47 billion women born under the age of 8 by 2050 is it truly believable that a quarter of women born in the next 34 years are going to be placed into a child marriage,8,

74596,have done some research in saudi echoing similar things everybody wants government jobs  but the government is trying to push private sector employment  so you end up with many saudis who do nt do anything showing up on payrolls and there s a somewhat true perception that most companies would prefer to hire foreigners  who will work harder  over citizens  not sure what the longterm solution is for the employment problems  but crashing oil revenue is definitely going to make things worse will be interesting to see if government is going to start shrinking public sector employment more heavily,5,

74675,driving drunk is not easy,1,
74676,what is 10 day weekend work release,1,
74677,at first i thought this was a reasonable charge  but when i read the article it said that she was actually driving with a flat tire most drunks are smart enough to avoid driving on a flat  this woman is an idiot and deserves a harsh punishment she was intoxicated enough to seriously endanger the lives of others  if an officer had nt pulled her over i m sure she would have caused some serious damage,,
74678,that s cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work releas,,
74679,well it s not like you can prove that she was actually intoxicated  so the fact that she was nt punished seems appropriate,,
74680,and my mom wonders why i m not married,,
74683,thats bad news for all the 711 in our town that take the,8,
74684,does nt this just translate into fewer places for poor people to buy food,7,
74685, 711 cashiers will now have to ring up cigarettes as organic kale instead of hot pockets,7,
74686,on the other hand  if the business stops taking food stamps entirely  not only can they not get the kale you want to make them eat  but they also ca nt get a loaf of bread or gallon of milk unless they start selling their food stamps to get cash to buy the milk and bread so the business still makes their money  the amount of food stamp fraud goes up  and the poor that you claim to be helping are getting even less food  healthy or otherwise  because of the food stampcash exchange rate,4,
74687,why are nt food stamps like wic  with wic you get vouchers for specific food items these items cover the basic food groups and align with a certain amount of nutritional value  meanwhile  you can buy friggin monster energy drinks with food stamps that makes no sense  regardless if you are looking at it from a healthy standpoint or a taxpayer standpoint,6,
74688,if obesity and other nutrition related issues are such a problem among the poor  would nt it be more cost effective to do away with food stamps and implement something like a food box program instead  in other words would the cost of labor to package and ship prepared food boxes in bulk to grocery stores and distribution centers be offset by what would be saved in reduced healthcare costs  imagine a program where you list the people in your household  any allergies or specific requirements and a box is prepared to supplement your family for a week it could contain things like rice  beans  canned or pouched goods like meats  vegetables and fruits  dried oatmeal and cereals  powdered milk  cooking oil every month they could receive a selection of 5 spices  salt and pepper and even a recipe pamphlet if in addition to the box  they started a program where grocery stores and produce growers could drop off older or bruised produce  people could pick some up for free when they picked up their boxes,7,
74689,what if the healthy foods do nt sell  are they still forced to stock them  would nt you think the actual grocers in the neighborhood would have a better sense of what their customers want than the federal government,4,

74693,honestly this will be great  the state  should  be very involved in what people eat for free,1,
74694,another  good intention  bad policy,1,
74695,this is the dark side of welfare  the constitution is completely circumvented the government has the power to cajole and pressure when it is putting stipulations on the money it gave out the government is capable of doing things it would never have the power of doing otherwise  like forcing a business to carry certain products  or forcing a person to apply for jobs or eventually  forcing people to work at government labor jobs,1,

74721,interesting though   since 2005  texas has prosecuted 38 juveniles for intoxication manslaughter or intoxication assault only three were sent to the adult system  and half of all cases resulted in probation of some kind  i think this is more telling of the justice system  and accessibility to competent  quality counsel it s clear money buys better legal counsel  but if the government subsidized public defense more heavily  the outcomes would clearly be different,9,
74722,cash is king in the world of corruption,9,
74723,i said this somwhere else  but it s also pertinent here  everyone is equal under the law and money is how we measure that equality,9,
74724,the difference  money,9,
74725,it s almost like the rich live under different rules,8,
74726,this is standard practice in the us judicial system outcomes will vary from case to case depending on financial status there s actually a legal term for it  it s called   cream ,9,
74727,my mom has always said guilty until proven rich,8,

74729,and liberty and justice for all  who can afford it ,5,
74730,i love how this article just glosses over the fact that arellano had previous dui convictions which is why he did nt receive the same sentence  this was couch s first dui case which is why he got probation  as texas takes the rehab route  but whatever lets rage and ignore the fact,8,
74731,is everyone here honestly  seriously shocked that money gets you out of trouble  am i taking crazy pills,5,
74732,going beyond the dae legal system is corrupt  circlejerk in this thread  there are certainly some differences in these cases firstly  the arellano case  the other one in the article  happened in 2007  six years before couch s trial likewise  the article says that arellano had driven while intoxicated and drank underage before  which means that he would ve had a greater chance of being moved to an adult trial meanwhile  couch had no prior violations of the law  meaning that he could nt be moved to an adult court,6,
74733,i understand what you are trying to do with your anecdotal case comparisons however  they are nt comparable cases when you consider all the factors  including criminal history  but  even if you ignore all the other factors  i know of a white 20 yo male from a fairly wealthy family in my area who was sent to prison for a year based on a drunk driving accident so my anecdotal evidence shows similar punishment to your anecdotal case thereby anecdotally refuting your point,8,
74734,the real crime here those eyebrow,6,
74735,gee  it s almost like different judges and prosecutors in different areas with separate cases can lead to different verdicts or something,6,
74736,that s why the case became famous because he got away while guilty that was autocorrect capitalization,4,
74737,affluenza is just a fake term that means the following  if you are rich  you do nt go to jail if you are not  you will spend 10 years like 95  of americans,4,
74738,let s be clear what happened to the poor kid was what s supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone you fucking go to prison couch was the exception,7,
74739,he did nt go free he was on probation and then he violated that  so he s going to jail,8,
74740,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,3,
74741,if someone is brought up too rich to not know the difference between right and wrong  why can the same argument not be used for poor people who commit crimes  people who are brought up in poverty do nt really know right from wrong just as much as a kid who has rich parents,3,

74746,i fucking hate ethan couch  i mean look at that look on his face disgusting i mean even his name is stupid,5,
74747,horrible headline  38 cases of dui manslaughter in texas since 2005 and only 3 of them went to adult court  that tells you the vast majority of these cases are handled with kid glovesso picking out one of 3 that went the other route and comparing it to the affluenza case is disingenuous  but fuck it  that is what the media does today god forbid they instead do an article focusing on how in texas if you are a drunk driving kid that kills people you will get away with it 35 out of 38 time,4,
74748,it did nt seem to mention how they had the same judge  we ve already established this same judge would have been open to giving a similar sentence to a poor minority because she tried to do just that keep making this a race issue  though lord knows the media loves to stir up ignorant poor folks  also  anyone who comes to the us illegally and kills is citizens deserves little sympathy he was a juvenile  so it would be appropriate to release him and deport him  i do nt understand the need to distort issues to make tbem about race we already have enough problems it s already an established fact that those with the means to afford a lawyer fair better than those who do nt,3,

74759,no shit  i mean was nt the entire outrage that similar cases normally lead to prison in the first place,1,
74760,seriously  the rich kid,1,
74761,that s what  affluenza  means literally the entire point of this case and why it s been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich,1,
74762,i say it like my grandma used to  money talks  bullshit walks,1,
74763,he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows wtf,1,

74766,biggest problem in the universe  vote it up  http  thebiggestproblemintheuniversecomepisode8,1,
74769,this is why a lot of former cops are setting up companies where they transport the cash for it it s also a huge motivation for the stores to keep 2 separate sets of books  a real one and one the irs gets to see,9,
74770,this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day,9,
74771,gt  one of the three men who escaped from a california jail last month had been charged with kidnapping a marijuana dispensary owner that they suspected had hidden large amounts of cash in the desert the man and his accomplices are accused of driving the dispensary owner out to the desert  torturing him and cutting off his penis  sheesh i m not carrying more than  10 in my wallet from now on  and that has nothing to do with the fact that i m broke,9,
74772,this is why they get robbed all the time out here no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys,7,
74773,ca nt these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us,8,
74774,there s a great documentary on netflix called  high profits  about a business in breckenridge  co right before full legalization took effect  one of the big issues was exactly this only being able to do business in cash from payroll to paying city taxes they had  120k in cash they had to just walk into the front of the city building with and that was just the first month alone  some of the people that make the drops to the shops are walking out with  10k in their pockets and no security at all it s terrifying,8,
74775,civil forfeiture time,6,
74776,ironically  it s also just flat out illegal to own large sums of money anything over a few hundred bucks  and the government can sieze that money  because the money committed the crime of intent to purchase narcotics,9,
74777,time to start using gold,6,
74778,so the tax man will gladly take cannadollars  but the banks will not this is ridiculously stupid,6,
74779,same deal in washington still have to buy my shit with cash oh but i can buy cigs and alcohol with a card no problem  if you want to pick up a gram here or there it s no problem  but i buy in bulk  since it s cheaper that means i need to stop by the bank to get  140 that s the only time i carry that much money on me  it s like requiring a personal check to get a passport no cashier s check  no card wtf it s 2016,8,
74780,are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money,4,
74781,this war on cash is such bullshit  people carried cash until 12 years ago and it was perfectly fine  now they are trying to restrict flying with cash  purchasing with cash  seizing cash   the only problem is that the money is due on one day  they need to have the tax office take payment on any day of the week  so it s stacked,6,
74782,i wonder how negative interest rates  if implemented  would effect the marijuana business these value of the business would probably increase as they had large sums of cash on hand their credit worthiness would increase because they had something of value  cash  but they would be penalized for depositing that cash according to the recent imf working paper i wonder if they would become attractive targets for some banks to help capitalize their weak balance sheets,3,
74783,oh well let you do business  but you just wo nt be able to use any banks what a backwards ass countr,3,

74801,it s the same way in washington and colorado it s still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed,1,
74802,since the money cant be deposited into a bank would a good option to take be converting it into precious metals such as gold  you would still need to store the gold but that could be easily done in a safety deposit however unless you know where to go  getting that much gold could raise the attention of people you dont want raised to begin with it s not like in china or india  if you show up with a briefcase of cash and walk out with a smaller case of gold  no one really cares,1,

74847,not really too much context given here  so it s hard to guess at the actual situation  but federal student loans  at least direct loans and the majority of those older loans passed back to fsa as they phased out the guarantee programs  do nt get sold to private collection agencies at this time maybe that part happened a while back  before current policies went into place and the collectors are taking advantage of the protections that federallyoriginated loans have  anyway  for people who are interested in learning more about how defaulted federal student loans are being collected today   check this out   https  wwwfbogovindex  s  opportunityamp  mode  formamp  id  216a8418f8e71f0c9c3475946ab100f8amp  tab  coreamp  _cview  1  they re currently in the middle of contracting new private collection agencies to service defaulted loans and you can see in the rfp documents how agencies are being scored and how that ties into account assignments  basically  for those who do nt feel like running through all of it  the big emphasis for student loan collections now is getting people through affordable rehabilitation options and into incomedriven repayment plans placements look like they re going to be based about 50  on careful regulatory compliance and borrower satisfaction surveys  which would make it extremely difficult for high pressure collections tactics to work out in the long run  none of that changes this story  just thought it was interesting in light of some of the comments i ve read that indicate people believe strongarm collection tactics for student loans will always be the norm  tldr  they re at least trying to throw a friendly paint job over the horribly broken federal student loan system these days,9,
74848,if you dont show up to court after you have been served this is what happens he has been ignoring collection attempts  he got served and ignored that too im not in favor of this man being arrested but you cant ignore court summons if you get served you have to go,9,
74849,upconwell said it best  gt  you are reading way to much into the article no one said they were violent no one said they had their guns drawn they are us marshals  they carry guns  every god damn day   gt  they probably went to his door  knocked he answered and they said  hey  we have a warrant for you for failing to appear in a federal court   he probably said  oh shit let me get some pants  gt  no violence  no guns drawn  everything was pretty standard and nonviolent  gt  plus  it should be noted that he was not arrested for failing to pay student loans  he was arrested for violating a court order,9,
74850,how do you not pay a  1500 loan after 30 friggin years,9,
74851,gt  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  this almost reads like satire,9,
74852,i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors,9,
74853,where in this article did it say  guns drawn  as most people are stating here  it says  with guns   every on duty us marshal goes through their day  with guns   someone signed a contract for a loan  and then spends almost three decades not paying it i agree that a police force should nt have been used there are financial measures that can be taken upon default of a loan rather than criminal  but i m really surprised by the circle jerk that s happening over a fox news article,9,
74854,can i get a misleading title please,8,
74855,you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day,6,
74856,lol  you guys are so gullible the guy dodged this debt and refused to engage the proper authorities for 25 years this is nt a new college graduate that missed one payment then you have the cascade of predictable posts stating  boot lickers    debtors prison  and how in 30 years this will be the watershed moment we all look back to as we are enslaved by the government this is a statement case the feds took an extreme example and made an extreme example of this putz the goal of this action is compliance and to get folks to not ignore their obligations the money spent on this will scare the other million folks that are past due to actually pick up the phone and engage them to resolve the debt no one held a gun to this guy s head to sign up for the student loans and no one was stopping him for 25 years from making a payment plan for the remaining  1500 this guy deserved it and as a tax payer this is ok by me,9,
74857,real story here dude was sued by the united state of america  he refused to appear  a default judgment was issued against him  he refused to appear for postjudgment depositions  judge issued an order directing him to appear in court  he ignored it and then the judge issued an arrest warrantincareration order and federal judges use us marshalls to enforce their orders  so he was nt arrested for having old student loans he was arrested for refusing to comply with a direct order from the judge  http  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386htm,8,
74858,that dude could not come up with  1500 in 29 years,8,
74859, a few years ago congress allowed the private sector to contract for student loan collections and so you have these private companies who are doing this  i find this scary  even though i have no student loans to pay off they dragged this dude to court and made him sign an agreement in front of their private attorney he had no attorney present  and was nt read any rights  edit  quote is from the video,9,
74860,forever grateful i graduated with minimal student loans ca nt ignore bills for 25 years though  regardless of what those payments stem from from reading through the comments here  it seems like incomebased payment option is the smartest option,6,
74861,i wish my student loan balance was  1500,6,
74862,i knew this story was light on facts turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies  source   yahoo finance   https  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386html,6,
74863,gt  our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is nt the first and wo nt be the last  this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least,8,
74864,he was nt arrested for not paying his loan  he was arrested for not showing up in court  and the marshals did nt storm his house guns blazing they had guns  with them   like every other cop in the entire country,7,
74865,if you take money and have no plans on paying it back  it s called stealing,9,
74866,right the debt collectors just bought the debt  payed the filing fees to bring the case to court  threatened the man with their now official   pay us or else  and when he did not they used their settlement to have him arrested by the marshals nope  no government officers for hire here  just good old debt collection paid and serviced through the courts,5,
74867,til that most people have no understanding how the court system works  yes  civil attorneys can issue subpoenas  yes  a court can hold you in contempt if you fail to appear yes  a potential punishment for contempt is a bench warrant for your arrest  tl  dr  you can not simply ignore subpoenas you may go to jail,5,
74868,writing and publishing articles like this is dangerous the author offered a sensationalist angle on the  story  while leaving out key elements of why they were there in the first place ie missing court summons this is highly unethical and paints the federal government into a larger narrative that fox has been going for basically  rallying people by emotion not logic,5,
74869,this just in  there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government film at 1,5,
74870,student loans were made with certain assumptions about the future of the economy  both on the part of the schools  the tuition they charge   the lenders  and the student people should be required to pay their student loans but they should be adjusted downward  edit  this guy had a loan for  1500 measly bucks and did nt make any payments in 30 years  i would like to know if he was destitute  or just decided  fuck you everyone  i want to keep my money ,8,
74871,misleading title the marshals service will  arrest  you if you fail to show up for a court appearance you are not being tossed in jail  you are being hauled into court when you refused to answer a summons  from the article   paul aker says he was arrested at his home last week for a  1500 federal student loan he received in 1987  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  does anyone feel sorry for this man   1500  be serious,7,
74872,if i did nt pay back a federal loan for 29 years  i d kind of expect for there to be negative effects this dude did nt pay his loan  including when he was taken to court over it and received a judgment from the court specifically telling him to pay it if you ignore a court order  you re gon na have a bad time  i mean yes  the financial aid system needs to be fixed  but they re going after people who purposely are nt paying their loans which is a surprising amount of people  given how many refund chasers there are in the world for anyone else  there are programs like deferment options  sliding payscales  and whatever else along with loan forgiveness after 20 years  it s a shitty system  but this guy s case is not going to be the one to change it because he does nt deserve to have people dying on his hill for his particular cause,7,
74873,i m socialist and firmly believe that education and medical care should be paid for by federal government out of contributions that we make  however with that said  if you are contributing member of society you have to be a special kind of asshole not to repay  1500 loan over the period of 29 years no matter what was that loan used for,8,
74874,why is this news,3,
74875,dude got letters in his mail for months to pay and appear in court  this doesnt just come out of the blue he refused to show up to court multiple times thats a criminal offense,5,

74995,not news to me i have a 3 hour outage at least once a month with comcast a 1020 minute outage daily around 56 am  and at least 34 10 minute outages sprinkled throughout the week  i know this because 2 out of every 5 or 6 dvr recorded shows are fucked up during the middle   absolutely awful i live in a moderate city  too  so it s not like i m in the middle of fucking nowhere,7,
74996,and then they wonder why people are ready to go to google fibe,7,
74997,loss of internet and television access for 3 days would cause mass panic and riot,8,
74998,my bad people i went over my 300gb and used way too much of an infinite resource,7,
74999,wow  17k outages nationwide for as much as 3 hours  obama needs to step in and fix this for sure ,9,
75000,gt  across us i bet i could find thousands who are angry at comcast  in my town alone ,5,
75001,i m fully expecting to get downvoted to hell here  but what the heck  i m not particularly fond of comcast  but unless i missed something here  which is entirely possible   this does nt actually sound like it was particularly horrific for people in general it sounds like a very small fraction of their nationwide customer base  had an outage of parts of their service for about 3 or 4 hours  not even all of their service  but things like they could nt access their hd channels  or their internet did nt work for a few hours  i understand for businesses  an internet outage can be a big deal  so some outrage on their part would be justified  but for the general consumer  come on  get a grip go read a book for a while  or go outside for a bit  or  gasp  go do something with your family  i m just not getting what the huge deal was here  what am i missing,7,
75002,i was part of the outage did nt have internet and only had access to about 8 sd channels i ll be honest  3 hours where i have to use my phone for internetsi could nt care less had to go out and shovel anyway  edit  couldgt  could n,7,
75003,not a fan of comcast  but with this outage they probably still provide 9999  uptime bunch of whiners  yes  i work in it,6,
75004,i like how this is news in this country,7,
75005,comcast angers me even without outages,7,
75006,the words  anger  and  comcast  come up often,4,
75007,there needs to be legally mandated uptime and speed requirements  95  of the time your connection must reach the  advertised  speed  no more  up to xmbps  allowed  and 99  of the time it must reach 14 of that speed if this is nt met then customers must be completely refunded for that month,4,
75008,is anyone else still completely fucking down  just everything  been down for 15 hours here,4,
75009,quote from the article   comcast has more than 27 million customers  and 89000 of those are new cable subscribers the company signed on last quarter that was its best performance in eight years  correct me if i m wrong but are nt there 2 choices for most people  sign up with comcast or do nt have high speed internet  it s like bragging because people choose to eat food from the only supplier rather than starve to death,4,
75010,comcast seems to be an isp that people love to hate  charter got so bad for so many years that i loved to hate them in all honesty  the past three to four years or so they have been great,7,
75011,customer service replied   working as intended,3,
75012,i ve had comcast xfinity for almost 2 years now and i ve never had an issue,5,
75013,fun story i was at a friend s place watching the superbowl in denver comcast blacked out cbs with 1 minute 26 seconds left on the clock in second quarter  and service was nt restored till about 15 seconds before 3rd quarter kicked off  idk how widespread this was but lots of denverites did nt get to see the super bowl halftime show i d imagine comcast would lose a lot of money if their advertisers paid to have a certain amount of views and one of the biggest markets  since denver was participating in the super bowl  cut out all views during the entire halftime show idk how their whole contract with that stuff goes though  i hear i did nt miss much though,1,
75014,that s what happens things go out sometimes,3,
75015,friend of mine called to ask why he couldnt connect  he obviously cant check if there are outages in his neighborhood without the internet  he calls them and they offer to send a tech to his house for like  80  they didnt tell him the price  but you know itd be up there  he spends an hour checking all his connections  digging through paperwork to find his modem settings page  finally calls back about 8hrs later hoping to talk to someone else and theyre like   oh yeah  there s an outage in your area   idiots,1,
75016,when i called  i was disconnected 3 times this is great customer nonservice beside the lack of tv thanks comcast for helping me make my change from you  easier,1,
75017,it s nothing new that comcast absolutely sucks,1,
75018,when you deal with technology  there is only one thing i can guarantee you it will get down at the worst possible time,1,
75019, compact angers thousands across the us for something other than just being comcast for once  ftf,1,
75020,they just put a data cap on my home internet how fucked is that  pretty fucked if you ask me,1,
75021,what is the most troubling about comcast is that when there is an outtage  it doesnt effect just a small region  but instead downs multiple states that seems so rediculous,1,
75022,once they fix the outage you re left with  comcast anger thousands across us,1,
75023,now only 1000 years to lrrr ruler of the planet omicron persei 8 comes to destroy earth,1,
75024,it s not like we re losing  that  much more bandwidth it s only like 20 megs less than what we had before which was only 80 megs less than what we re paying for,1,
75025,so  i had to get comcast recently because i moved and noticed something weird about my bill the letter in the mail has a different due date than the due date that shows up on the online account just saying folks make sure to pay 2 days before your date at least,1,
75026,just having comcast in general makes them angry,1,
75027, nsfw how comcast really feels   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  kmcny_pixdw,1,
75028,once in a while fios is out for a few hours hard to get too pissed  these things do happen i do nt think comcast needs an outage to be hated honestly though for me they were a decent provider  i never had a single issue with them except for the occasional outage,1,
75029,wow now that s comcastic,1,
75030,it was out for like 3 hours jesus christ,1,
75031,my comcast service  for the first time in years  has actually been pretty good lately but i d like to pay less  so i m rooting for google fiber to come to boston simply so i can reap the benefits of competition  i mean  that s what we really want  right  we do nt want yet another monopoly  no matter how  altruistic  we think google will be  we want the existing monopolies to be forced into providing quality service for a reasonable price  along with other choices,1,
75032,it probably still worked better than my centurylink ds,1,
75033,comcast s response   it pays the restoration fee  or else it gets the hose again,1,
75034,my case  as in many others  boils down to this  you can pay triple the amount for the same throughput speeds or you can curse comcast and wait for google fiber,1,
75035,at the same time  i would nt want to be on the other end and get screamed at from 10k  people experiencing the outage i just went out instead of being at home it s aggregating that it happens so often  at the same time there are other things to d,1,
75036,they should just switch providers if they are nt satisfied  see what i did there ,1,
75037,after this comcast will just be turning off their services everywhere after all  they could save a ton of money that way,1,
75038,for comcast  it was tuesday,1,
75039,spread your cheeks  most of you wo nt even complain or ask for a billing credit,1,
75040,title should just be  comcast angers thousands across us   i fucking hate comcast with every fiber of my being  reasons  i  paying top dollar for slow as shit internet  ii  a modemrouter combo that broadcasts an unsecured public network from your home which has to be manually deactivated  iib  said modem has to be forced reset once a week  and doing so undoes the manual changes you made to get rid of the second network  iii  arbitrary data caps  iv  live television that freezes  v  ondemand that works infrequently  and turns into minecraft porn when it crashes  vi  customer  service  that refuses to listen to what your problem is  but instead tries to upsell you on a more advanced package  one of my dreams is to live long enough to see this shit stain regional monoploy of a company implode upon itself  or be run straight into the fucking grave by google fiber,1,
75041,i always laugh at this shit until i remember i m with twc  the   second   worst rated isp in america,1,
75042,where i live i would love to have this proble,1,
75045,gt   the order is vague and because it imposes disproportionate  intrusive  and punitive measures against households and businesses with   no due process     did nt see that one coming,9,
75046,isps do nt actually want to spy on their customers like that it costs more money to put systems in place to do so and to maintain and operate those systems on top of that  it will only bring them bad press that could piss off customers  cox is basically saying  fuck you i m not taking a significant financial hit to spy on our customers so you can sue them and make money for yourself  they are doing the right thing  and the right thing also happens to be in their best business interest,9,
75047,good guy cox  not selling out their customers  they actually have super reliable internet no outages in any of my apartments so far,9,
75048,so to sum that up we do nt have to worry about any cox blocking,9,
75049,that s nice  but i m still going to run a vpn,8,
75050,all in all i ve been pretty happy with cox as an isp i ve used them in two different cities and it s always been reliable and fast i pay for 300mbps service and always get those speeds  usually higher almost no outages they re putting in 1gbs service in many of their cities right now  including mine  my biggest gripe with them is they have a soft data cap of 2 tb for my tier they do not enforce the caps at all but the fact that they exist means they are probably toying with the idea and there would be nothing to stop them from going evil since they are a monopoly like every other major isp it s like a benevolent dictatorship  http  wwwspeedtestnetmyresult5089441276 that s with a netflix stream going on in another room right now,9,
75051,this must be a new thing many a year s ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did nt even know what that was  none of us knew what that even was and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi,7,
75052,i ve been really happy with cox for an isp both personally and professionally here in okc personally  out of nowhere they bumped my at home connection from 15mbit to 100mbit and my bill  went down  30  all out of nowhere  without me saying a word internet is always up  not throttled  and they have decent support if it s needed  professionally at my job i ran in ip phone deployment with them for our main office  3 satellite offices they were there 100  of the way i have personal names and numbers to call in the event of issues outside of the scope of my support as the companies it admin  and when we ve needed someone on site to climb a pole for instance their longest response time was 45 minutes  i know this sounds like rhailcorporate but the fact is out of all the isps i ve had  comcast  qwest  charter  etc  they ve been the best that s not saying they should nt and could nt be better  but they re angels next to the others  in fact they proactively contact me at work every once and awhile to check on things which i greatly appreciate and they bring us cookies every month yes  our isp brings yes cookies no  we re not a big company 9 employees they re just nice,8,
75053,basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum,8,
75054,i used to work for cox in the field and inside cox did have a department that would monitor massive down loading and uploading but they did away with it shortly after i got there  within a year cox ca nt afford to lose customers right now so it s no surprise they are nt allowing this if they did then they would go out of business from customer loss i survived their huge layoff and realignment,5,
75055,this is nothing new from cox i have had cox internet for over 10 years and worked for them a few years ago they have always had this attitude toward it s customers the customer pays for internet access  cox provides internet access they do nt even enforce data caps  at least in oklahoma   i have received a few emails due to using so much data suggesting that i switch to a business plan to maximize my speed  but have never been charged extra or cut off due to exceeding a data cap,7,
75056,gt  last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers  what the actual fucking fuck,6,
75057,as a customer this is the first good thing i ve ever heard from cox,4,
75058,not true from my experience,3,
75059,i ve had them as an isp for several years and they re excellent i did have one month where i went over my allowed bandwidth limit  300 gb on a 50 mbps down plan   and all i got was an email saying  do nt do that again   no throttling or charges or anything on 100 mbps down plan right now and i usually get 110 at least they re great  come out to me if i m having internet trouble that s not solved by online support  etc pretty good basically  i love cox and i m very satisfied with how much i get,3,
75060,unrelated but i could nt stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox,3,
75061,i am a proud supporter of cox,3,
75062,where are all the penis jokes,3,
75063,not as nice as it sounds if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do nt catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status  eg that they do nt have any liabilityresponsibility for what people use their pipe for   most carriers are  very  vested in not being the internet police,3,
75064,i m guessing that if they had a way to monetize it and add to the bottom line  they d be very supportive,3,
75065,when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battl,5,
75066,cox is actually a familyowned business one of the major interest holders is a 96 year old woman who inherited from her father  she had been running it with her sister until her death in 2007   i happen to think they re one of the leastshady isp and cable providers out there  they also own the travel channel  which is a pretty great channel,5,
75067,i thought this was talking about jesse cox,4,
75068,i work for cox corporate in a startup tech company  and this makes me so happy  btw  they re just as decent an employer as they are an isp compan,3,
75069,cox is spying like a champ  rest assured you have to be quite innocent or high on meth to think they have nt supplied info to big brother and his little brothers  and will not in the future,3,
75070,yells loudly  i will not    whispers  if you need me too,1,
75071,on that headline alone  i thought jessie cox was asked to spy on his youtube subs  was very confused for a little bit,1,
75072,i knew he was my favorite eagl,1,
75073,well that s one bit of good news from cox now if they d stop raising my rates every few months,1,
75074,damn  i wish i had cox i have time warner and i m on my 3rd notice to stop torrenting i do nt know if they ll actually pull the plug  they re charging me out the ass already since they re the only provider in my area,1,
75075,fuck yea cox   comcast   1  co,1,
75076,cox  and to some extent time warner  are cable companies all cable companies fuck you in the ass  these two have the decency to spit on it first i at the very least get what i pay for with both of them,1,
75077,they sent me a few emails in the past  so i got a vpn i will still use it  but good on cox for not being dickbags,1,
75078,they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jone,1,
75079,i had cox for 3 years service was good  and over that 3 years  doubled my download speeds twice no extra cost upload was still garbage  but hey 10015 internet for  65 a month was still pretty killer i have 7575 fios now,1,
75080,almost every single person in my area that has gone to atamp  t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable  they have some shit with them but it s far less shit than others,1,
75081,they re my isp and even though they re the only isp in my city besides att and verizon  they ve been awesome,1,
75082,the shifting of blame to continue  going after johns and endusers has never worked,1,
75083,ho yeah  today is a good day to have cox  teehee,1,
75084,horseshit they cut off our internet because someone was downloading something like a year ago they re the best isp i ve ever used  but they absolutely do exactly what the mpaa et al want,1,
75085,between cox and cable one in both places i live  i actually like our midwest internet providers i feel bad for people getting rammed by twc and comcast we ve paid  45 for 100mbps for several years  which sounds way better than the horror stories i hear from you guys,1,
75086,cause they love internet freedom  or because it costs an extra 30 cents to have an extra indian screen data at the call center for 70 an hour,1,

75090,colleges really need to stop expelling students due to these kangaroo courts  i m fine with them if it s from breaking a school infraction like alcohol on a dry campus or something of that sort but  if a student is accused of a criminal offense  let the courts deal with it and decide from there  schools are nt equipped to deal with these kinds of cases  nor should they be expected to be these are lifechanging accusations and need to be treated as such  for the benefit of both parties involved,9,
75091,gt  ut investigators later decided  that the evidence supported a finding that  he  had sexually assaulted ms roe  the opposite of the conclusion reached by the more experienced detectives of the police department   the lawsuit says the dean of students then recommended he be expelled  ah but the police are looking for evidence that he did it  college tribunals assume he did and require he provide evidence that he did nt  which  typically  the accused is not allowed to present,9,
75092,gt  one plaintiff is a 24yearold recent graduate  the other is a 21yearold student who is one semester away from graduating with a bachelor  s degree in physics  their lawsuits say   in the graduate  s case  he faces being banned from any ut system campus  being denied a shot at a ut graduate degree and having a notation put on his transcript   the undergrad faces expulsion in addition to the same punishments  that does nt make any sense to me why would an institution retroactively amend the transcript of someone  who already graduated  to say this person violated school policy  after graduating   this seems to be more evidence that they re trying to scapegoat the plaintiffs here i mean  if they were concerned with the alleged victim s wellbeing more than trying to look  tough on sexual assault   what is the point of amending the transcript,9,
75093,who s the idiot who decided that kangaroo courts were a good idea,9,
75094,are we to the point where  sexual assaultrape  almost no longer have a meaning    you getting hammered and hooking up with a hammered guy is not rape  nor is it assault he should sue her for the exact same thing,8,
75095,i once saw a swedish movie called ondskan   evil  that drove me to become a lawyer today  here  https  enwikipediaorgwikievil_  2003_film   plot one of the key issues that caught my attention in this movie is the disregard of the law the school had to the protagonist s rights when he hired a lawyer  because of some grievance he had with the school  it backed off immediatly when the lawyer lay down the letter of the law to the headmaster of that educational institution in front of all his guests  in this university of texas sexual assault case  i believe imhlo  l is for legal   that the constitution sets a foundation of rules for everyone inside it s jurisdiction  and no internal policy that ut may have can go against the rules set by the us constitution everyone should enjoy the right of being innocent until proven guilty  and time and time again people are being layed off their jobs  students expelled  lives ruined because of yettobeproven  accusations  the right thing that any institution  like ut  should always do is address all cases of criminal behavior by always recognizing first the accused innocence until proven guilty in a court of law  edit  grammar,8,
75096,gt  the friend said she thought the woman was conscious because  when she saw her kissing this man  she was awake and talking  the lawsuit says  so intentionally or not the woman who claimed to be assaulted is not telling the truth  editand they decided to expel him without even talking to the student his first chance to give his side was an appeal for his expulsion this is a fucking kangaroo court  edit2  the second lawsuit claims expulsion against a student was recommended without the alleged victim ever personally making a sex assault accusation  http  kxancom20160205lawsuitsagainstutallegebiasagainstmalesinsexassaultcase,9,
75097,gt  the undergrad  s lawsuit says he had sex with a woman who was not a ut student after leaving a house party near campus sometime after midnight on march 6  2015 about a month later  the woman  s father called ut police and accused the man of sexually assaulting his daughter  fuck this i understand that if a woman is  actually  rapedmolestedassaulted it could be hard to come forward  but waiting a month or longer and  then  reporting it is bullshit you get raped  you report it immediately the longer you wait  the more i m going to doubt your accusation,7,
75098,gt  university police never spoke to the woman the undergrad was accused of assaulting and no criminal charges were ever pursued  his lawsuit says the father  s report was referred to the ut dean of students  okay what the hell  seriously  though its this sort of thing that makes me really hate schools handling sexual assault cases on their own the police did nt even talk to the accused victim  but decided to tell the dean instead  it feels like it happens all the time when we have these alternate systems of punishment we stop treating crimes like crimes and treat them like rule infractions a rule infraction is cheating on a test an alleged assault is a crime treat it like one,7,
75099,eli5 kangaroo courts thanks,8,
75100,activist administrators  check lack of due process  check prohibited from legal council or cross examination of the accuser  check nothin to see here  move along people,6,
75101,well  they are probably right these school kangaroo courts have demonstrated they have no respect for the privacy and rights of the accused  and are only interested in demonstrating how seriously they take sexual assault accusations,6,
75102,male privilege,8,

75104,reddit is nt okay with witch hunts  but the university of texas and 1600s salem encourage them,7,
75105,stay away from liberal colleges  they are cesspools of tumblrina ideals  i could barely stand the required diversity classes from my public university nothing but priviledge  patriarchy  and man hatin,8,
75106,it seems to me that a public institution has to follow the sixth amendment  which grants  the right to a public trial without unnecessary delay  the right to a lawyer  the right to an impartial jury  and the right to know who your accusers are and the nature of the charges and evidence against you,6,
75107,jane roe because jane doe would be incest,4,
75108,so these students that are expelled do they have to still pay back their loans even though they do nt get a degree now and can they carry their credits over to another school or are they now worthless,5,
75109,i love how at the end she implies that if there were a person punching people randomly on campus they would choose to not involve the police presumably so that the assault victims could  control their own destiny,3,
75110,30 year old here  and planning on returning to school with all this insanity about social values exploding everywhere  i may just hold off a few more years and wait for school to become a profitable idea again,3,
75111,gt  the university has been placed under enormous political pressure to appear tough on those accused of sexual assault  there s your problem right there how about be tough on those convicted of sexual assault and those whom the law decides are innocent be treated as such,3,
75112,umso expel the drunken slut too  right  i could get behind that they both got drunk and made bad choices that reflect poorly on the school kick em both out  why only the male  did he conspire in some way to get her drunk  if they re both adults that got drunk and fucked then they re both equally guilty,7,
75113,considering that almost every case of a rape accusation that s come out massively public has been shown to be fraudulent  i m reserving judgement on this one,3,

75175,this makes sense a lot of people in science fields relating to cancer formation  such as radiology and medicinal biology  are of the opinion that most cancerous tumors are actually quietly killed by the body before they can reach critical mass to defend themselves  and the ones that prove dangerous are the ones that either do nt register to t cells or which grow too quickly to be snuffed to simplify  the reasons for this are simple  not everyone dies from cancer  and everyone gets exposed to carcinogens given the rate of mutation  the influence of radiation  the amount of background radiation  etc  that everyone is unavoidably exposed to  we should all develop tumors if there is a true casual relationship if you simply say that the body is helpless against them naturally  we would all die from cancer the body  must  be defending itself from them given that we do nt  in fact  it s basically accepted as scientific truth cancer is nt simply the presence of cancerous tumors  it s the presence of cancerous tumors that have the right surrounding cells  in the right quantity  that do nt die from immune system intervention and which have favorable growth conditions most small tumors simply do nt have the right conditions  and die studies have confirmed that the ones that register as cancer are a subset of all tumors that might form  because this subset avoids the usual limiting factors  so  going back to the article  this is simply taking the bodies natural process for fighting tumors and guiding it to specific cancers it might normally miss and saying  go get it   then praying you did nt just kill the poor sap with his now manically overenthusiastic immune system,6,

75248,the entitlement attitude of so many americans  gt  if it was me  i would have probably escorted this procession to the burial  your funeral escort was driving without a valid license the chp was correct to pull him over and cite him the rest of the funeral procession was free to continue on but you chose to pull over instead that was your own decision that caused you to be late the funeral  what is so aggravating to me about this is the family will file a lawsuit and probably win they will get to think they are right but they will milk the taxpayers of thousands of dollars,1,

75257,i have my own super secret private social network site that only i know about,6,
75258,so  i read the article and it appears the site was not created by anonymous but anonymous advocates the site  i believe facebook could use some healthy competition  though i question how private anyone s information can be on the internet  even with encryption it seems no matter how much you try to protect someone s information online  there is always someone who  with enough time and ingenuity  can obtain it,5,
75259,anyone else get the feeling this was an ad,4,
75260, doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  i have watched criminal minds penelope can do it,6,
75261,given the propensity of anonymous for leaking confidential and private information of people who do nt share their viewpoints  i do nt know how super private it would stay if someone expressed a contrary opinion would my belief that kanye is an immature narcissist result in release of the name and location of my virginity loss  or my 2nd grade teacher  btw  not the same person ,6,
75262,i bet tom from facebook is already a membe,3,
75263,gt  but unlike its competitors it doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  so how does it make money to pay for development  management  support  bandwidth  and servers  i do nt know how this shit gets reported slow news day  remember that stupid  social network  diaspora  they got global coverage about their facebook alternative i do nt think they ever even finished the product  let alone had anyone use it  must be built by the son of some important news editor who can drum up publicity this is likely the same,3,

75285,i know it is a reach but why do these people need to make high salaries it is a charity you are supposed to be doing something good for other people if pay is needed then just like congress no more than 80k you are performing a service for people  10 of those charities involve the police the nickel tin mafia have their hands in all kinds of money making rackets,1,
75287,if you need to call a suicide hotline the va is garbage i ve used the military one source when i was having a mental breakdown one of the ladies sat on the phone with me and just talked for almost an hour here is their number 8003429647 i highly recommend it these arent va employees they are licenced counselors and dont get paid by how many calls they answer so they will take there time and make sure you are stable if you are still active duty or even reserves i believe they still do one on one counseling sessions that will not be documented in anyway so no fear of reprisal  here is another one you can call  text  or message https  wwwveteranscrisislinenetmobile  this one connects you to contracted va employees so not the ones you get normally although the same thing happens if its full  it will reroute you  that s the mobile link sorry if you need something else do nt settle for poor service get help  military crisis line through the military crisis line  a person in need can talk or chat confidentially with a trained counselor in as quickly and easily as a single phone call or click of a mouse the military crisis line  is available 247 and free for activeduty  guard and reserve members  their families and friends can be reached in the united states at 8002738255  then press 1 can be reached in europe at 0080012738255 or dsn 118  the tollfree service in europe may not be available through all carriers or in all countries  can be reached in korea at 0808 555 118 or dsn 118 can be reached in afghanistan at 00 1 800 273 8255 or dsn 111 offers confidential online chat at the military crisis line website or by texting to 838255 another edit  if anyone needs to talk please feel free to contact me shit  send me a pm and i ll give you my number and we can talk i ve lost too many friends to suicide and hate how this cycle perpetuates itself,8,
75288,because america loves her servicemen and women so she wants them to help themselve,8,
75289,i have been calling the helpline everyday for 2 weeks it is a recorded message saying call back later we are busy just then general va helpline,7,
75290,the problem with the va  like most other government agencies  is that there is no accountability when you ca nt fire workers who are lazy  negligent  or worthless  you end up with a disfunctional organization filled with lazy  negligent  and worthless people,7,
75291,yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country,4,
75292,i have a pretty easy solution  why do nt overflow suicide calls just get forwarded to the regular suicide hotline  s   sure its probably better to deal with someone specifically trained to deal with service men and women but anyone is better then a voicemail,6,
75293,that vm box is gon na get overloaded quic,3,
75294,pissing off trained military personnel seems like a dumb idea in the long ru,3,
75295,and sanders wants to make this available for everyone it s not the money that causes this agency to be this way it s the nature of the federal government,4,
75296,it is nt a secret that the va is understaffed that is the biggest issue with the va and if they had more funding for labor costs  they would be in a far better spot,1,
75297,i ve been getting this for over a month the one time i did connect  the estimated wait time was 55 minutes,1,
75298,started up telepsyche again trying to make some progress a pending appointment looms  and i am very much looking forward to it  until she calls me and tells me they re cancelling it  i get a couple of appoints out of them  and then someone is sick  or changes positions there s no way for me to develop a healthy trusting relationship with my therapist  this is not an effective way to heal  so fuck it i ll go till i burn out in a glorious explosion of give a fucks and poop,1,
75299,remember when the va story broke it was really big news and everyone was talking about it and it was front page on reddit  nothing s changed  stories keep coming out about how nothing s changed  but no one cares either because it s not new anymore  or because of politics  or maybe both i do nt know,1,
75300,can anyone explain why the va is so dysfunctional  in short  i do nt get it it seems like they have tons of money but ca nt get their shit together,1,

75310,seriously why are we  the usa  importing workers on visas to work at 711s,,
75312,if the proposal came from a doctor or scientist  i would be 100  on the side of this bill but it comes from a senator  which makes me want to question it  scientific papers require peer review from the most qualified people to call bullshit on an idea before you can get it published as legitimate i m not saying i m questioning the idea  but i do nt know enough about the process of bills and laws to give it my automatic seal of approval  i think it s a good idea to administer anesthesia to an unborn human that can feel pain whether or not it increases the cost of abortion but the cost is still a talking point all i can do is hope that the people in charge of the decision in the end have the same concerns that i do,8,
75313,i mean  we already use anesthesia on fetuses when performing surgery in the womb for exactly this reason  so it s hardly surprising  http  wwwdoctorsonfetalpaincomfetalpaintheevidence5documentatio,7,
75314,wether a fetus is under anesthesia is completely dependent on the type of anesthetic being performed any general anesthetic also anesthetizes the fetus while other types like spinal or local do not even then  there is no accurate way to quantify or measure awareness in fetuses  much less adults undergoing anesthesia the body also still responds to pain under anesthesia  as its an autonomic response  so the definition of  feeling pain  is not something that should be measured i feel like awareness  which is impossible to measure in a fetus regardless  is a real idicator of humanity an easy solution would be to simply do all elective abortions under general anesthesia  which may cost more  but is easily doable i have no idea what the preferred method of anesthesia is  if any  for elective abortions  source  i do anesthesia in a catholic hospital,5,
75315,i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them,7,
75316,they have nt decided at what point of gestation this would happen  gt  montana lawmakers passed a similar law in 2015 requiring fetal anesthesia before surgeries  including abortion  after 20 or more gestational weeks  so  4 months the general consensus for viability outside the womb is around 6 monthsish for some the concept of consciousness coincides with viability outside the womb,6,
75317, this is a review on fetal pain   http  jamajamanetworkcomarticleaspx  articleid  201429amp  resultclick  1  from clinical review  although it is 10 years old it says  gt  evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques similarly  limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion,5,
75318,is nt this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor s office  would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder,5,
75319,ignorant people propose bill based on said ignorance,,
75320,i m going to talk about this as delicately as possible i  genuinely  want thoughts and opinions on this subject  i am asking that no one become immediately offended by what i m about to say rather than respond with your opinion telling me why you believe that my view should change i am childfree i do nt want kids  i m 35  so it s pretty much set in stone at this juncture in my life i do nt see myself as a prolife or prochoice supporter and the reason for that is because i kind of agree with both sides on one hand i firmly believe that the destruction of a human being  born or not  is murder it fits the definition  of  murder before you downvote me into oblivion  let me be clear it s not the votes i care about it s that you understand where i m coming from even though i have that belief  i also believe that some people were just not meant to be children but therein lies another debate  why do nt they place it in adoption  because most of the time unwanted children are kept  they re not placed into adoption and when they re kept their chances of being neglected as children  whether it be mentally  emotionally  or physically  rise exponentially i certainly would nt want to have a child and resent it i  do nt  have children because frankly i m mean as a damn snake i do nt see any part of me that could ever have a child and not lose my temper with it and i would nt put a kid through that  because  i  was put through that i would be a horrible parent  anyway  i have a point i swear if you re going to have an abortion  why anesthetize it first  do i believe that it can feel  absolutely  but you re killing it i mean it s not like you re putting it to sleep and saying   here  fight for your life  you re fucking killing it so why have a crisis of conscience about it  again  i m sorry if i offend anyone  that s not my intention i m just a realistic person and it is what it is sugarcoating it does nt change it the bill seems like a waste of time and tax dollars  edit  i do nt understand why this is being downvoted so  please  give me your views instead of leaving me wondering because if there s something i m not understanding it needs to be made clear again this is absolutely not about the votes rather than having a discussion,,
75321,if you pinch a fetus it will cry so that pretty much proves they feel pai,,
75322,because that makes it okay  smh,,
75324, every  prepackaged shredded cheese has it it s the most common anticlumping agent used around the world the argument is that the labels said 100  cheese,9,
75325,labels should be accurate end of story if the product inside does not match the label ingredients  it is fraud and should be prosecuted as such,8,
75326,that s why you buy a little wedge of parm and use a microplane grater on it to shave cheese onto your pasta the wedge lasts a very long time  and in the end it s cheaper than the nasty jars,7,
75327,cellulose is the actual substance you ll find it in all pregrated cheeses these guys were just busted putting too much in to save    lettuce is also made of cellulose where commercial outfits get it for cheese  i guess could be just about any plant judged edible  including  sure  trees  also who knows what kind of cheese you re supposedly getting much nicer to get a hunk of the real stuff and a crank grater  my knuckles hate box graters with a passion ,8,
75328,so my penne has wood,7,
75329,so the correct labeling is 92  cheese and 8  wood filler  i think that s right,6,
75330,solution  buy your parmesan  domestic or real  and grate it yourself tastes better too if you re really lazy  grate it and freeze until you need it,7,
75331,damn were becoming like china  next will have faked food,6,
75332,what kind of wood   are we talking the high quality organic stuff  or factory processed scrap wood  because goddamnit if they ve been slipping cheap wood shavings into my welfarecheese  we re going to have an fucking issue on our hands,4,
75333,lol  wood it is cellulose trying to get clicks,6,
75334,i m safe  source  only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti,3,
75335,i shred my own parmesan cheese  it makes worlds differenc,3,
75336,this is why i do nt buy nasty sargento cheese ever taste it  it tastes like wood  i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better,3,
75337,hmm i am pretty sure i misread that title,1,
75338,it s cheaper by the chunk anyways,1,
75339,similar to olive oil  most parmesan cheese is nt even parmesan cheese,1,

75470,colleges really need to stop expelling students due to these kangaroo courts  i m fine with them if it s from breaking a school infraction like alcohol on a dry campus or something of that sort but  if a student is accused of a criminal offense  let the courts deal with it and decide from there  schools are nt equipped to deal with these kinds of cases  nor should they be expected to be these are lifechanging accusations and need to be treated as such  for the benefit of both parties involved,9,
75471,gt  ut investigators later decided  that the evidence supported a finding that  he  had sexually assaulted ms roe  the opposite of the conclusion reached by the more experienced detectives of the police department   the lawsuit says the dean of students then recommended he be expelled  ah but the police are looking for evidence that he did it  college tribunals assume he did and require he provide evidence that he did nt  which  typically  the accused is not allowed to present,9,
75472,gt  one plaintiff is a 24yearold recent graduate  the other is a 21yearold student who is one semester away from graduating with a bachelor  s degree in physics  their lawsuits say   in the graduate  s case  he faces being banned from any ut system campus  being denied a shot at a ut graduate degree and having a notation put on his transcript   the undergrad faces expulsion in addition to the same punishments  that does nt make any sense to me why would an institution retroactively amend the transcript of someone  who already graduated  to say this person violated school policy  after graduating   this seems to be more evidence that they re trying to scapegoat the plaintiffs here i mean  if they were concerned with the alleged victim s wellbeing more than trying to look  tough on sexual assault   what is the point of amending the transcript,9,
75473,who s the idiot who decided that kangaroo courts were a good idea,9,
75474,are we to the point where  sexual assaultrape  almost no longer have a meaning    you getting hammered and hooking up with a hammered guy is not rape  nor is it assault he should sue her for the exact same thing,8,
75475,i once saw a swedish movie called ondskan   evil  that drove me to become a lawyer today  here  https  enwikipediaorgwikievil_  2003_film   plot one of the key issues that caught my attention in this movie is the disregard of the law the school had to the protagonist s rights when he hired a lawyer  because of some grievance he had with the school  it backed off immediatly when the lawyer lay down the letter of the law to the headmaster of that educational institution in front of all his guests  in this university of texas sexual assault case  i believe imhlo  l is for legal   that the constitution sets a foundation of rules for everyone inside it s jurisdiction  and no internal policy that ut may have can go against the rules set by the us constitution everyone should enjoy the right of being innocent until proven guilty  and time and time again people are being layed off their jobs  students expelled  lives ruined because of yettobeproven  accusations  the right thing that any institution  like ut  should always do is address all cases of criminal behavior by always recognizing first the accused innocence until proven guilty in a court of law  edit  grammar,8,
75476,gt  the friend said she thought the woman was conscious because  when she saw her kissing this man  she was awake and talking  the lawsuit says  so intentionally or not the woman who claimed to be assaulted is not telling the truth  editand they decided to expel him without even talking to the student his first chance to give his side was an appeal for his expulsion this is a fucking kangaroo court  edit2  the second lawsuit claims expulsion against a student was recommended without the alleged victim ever personally making a sex assault accusation  http  kxancom20160205lawsuitsagainstutallegebiasagainstmalesinsexassaultcase,9,
75477,gt  the undergrad  s lawsuit says he had sex with a woman who was not a ut student after leaving a house party near campus sometime after midnight on march 6  2015 about a month later  the woman  s father called ut police and accused the man of sexually assaulting his daughter  fuck this i understand that if a woman is  actually  rapedmolestedassaulted it could be hard to come forward  but waiting a month or longer and  then  reporting it is bullshit you get raped  you report it immediately the longer you wait  the more i m going to doubt your accusation,7,
75478,gt  university police never spoke to the woman the undergrad was accused of assaulting and no criminal charges were ever pursued  his lawsuit says the father  s report was referred to the ut dean of students  okay what the hell  seriously  though its this sort of thing that makes me really hate schools handling sexual assault cases on their own the police did nt even talk to the accused victim  but decided to tell the dean instead  it feels like it happens all the time when we have these alternate systems of punishment we stop treating crimes like crimes and treat them like rule infractions a rule infraction is cheating on a test an alleged assault is a crime treat it like one,7,
75479,eli5 kangaroo courts thanks,8,
75480,activist administrators  check lack of due process  check prohibited from legal council or cross examination of the accuser  check nothin to see here  move along people,6,
75481,well  they are probably right these school kangaroo courts have demonstrated they have no respect for the privacy and rights of the accused  and are only interested in demonstrating how seriously they take sexual assault accusations,6,

75486,it seems to me that a public institution has to follow the sixth amendment  which grants  the right to a public trial without unnecessary delay  the right to a lawyer  the right to an impartial jury  and the right to know who your accusers are and the nature of the charges and evidence against you,6,
75487,jane roe because jane doe would be incest,4,
75488,so these students that are expelled do they have to still pay back their loans even though they do nt get a degree now and can they carry their credits over to another school or are they now worthless,5,
75489,i love how at the end she implies that if there were a person punching people randomly on campus they would choose to not involve the police presumably so that the assault victims could  control their own destiny,3,

75491,gt  the university has been placed under enormous political pressure to appear tough on those accused of sexual assault  there s your problem right there how about be tough on those convicted of sexual assault and those whom the law decides are innocent be treated as such,3,
75492,umso expel the drunken slut too  right  i could get behind that they both got drunk and made bad choices that reflect poorly on the school kick em both out  why only the male  did he conspire in some way to get her drunk  if they re both adults that got drunk and fucked then they re both equally guilty,7,
75493,considering that almost every case of a rape accusation that s come out massively public has been shown to be fraudulent  i m reserving judgement on this one,3,
75494, ut investigates more than 100 allegations of sexual assault a year  and that number is growing  liebman said   how the hell are there hundreds of allegations a year that s insane this reminds me of the play the crucible  i saw you with the devilcommunistscapitalists  homo raptorus,1,
75495,damned if you do damned if you dont,1,
75496,seems like the girl was so hammered that she could nt remember the sex figured it would be less shameful if she accused him of assault,1,

75511,i moved away from california at the end of december this helps reinforce my decision as a good idea,,
75513,fucking sad how this was nt described as an act of terrorism i guess that title is reserved for nonchristians,9,
75514,it is sad that it closed even for a short time people like fiorina do nt give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time,8,
75515,definitely not terrorism though  just a little rampage  you know he was probably having a bad day or something,8,
75516,good for them  dont let those freedom hating assholes scare you away from your job,8,

75518,is carly out of the race yet  i do nt think that rightwing  fringe conartist is done riling up her terrorist sect,6,
75519,deadly rampage  was  terrorist attack  a little too onthenose,6,

75524,so  someone went on a shooting rampage and killed people in order to stop planned parenthood from killing people  but now planned parenthood is open again  and proudly killing people  well  i am glad that worked out the entire thing makes tons of sense,,
75525,pp is where there is regular deadly rampages against unborn babies,,
75526,planned parenthood is basically condoms and the oklahoma city bombing,,
75528,i lived 200yds from a burn pit when i was there in 04 i had some skin disease for about 2 years after iraq and some kind of asthma the va did nt give a shit then and they still do nt care  so  i got that goin for me,9,
75529,i was in tikrit  cob speicher  from 08 to 09 i lived a few hundred feet from the  burn pit  it was basically a huge junk yard with 3 huge constantly burning rectangular pits they were about 75 feet long and 50 feet across iirc you could see black or white smoke billowing from the area all the time i had to go there at least once a week to dump trash imagine standing over a red hot fire throwing junk off the back of a flatbed truck while it was 130 degrees outside sometimes the smog was so thick driving through the junk yard  that you could nt see 50 feet in front of you the smoke would almost always linger around the base and it smelled awful olfactory fatigue did not apply here it always smelled no matter how long you d be  exposed  you never got used to it never mind that they burned our shit right next door i remember one day we had to do a pt test the 2 mile run was on the same road as the burn pit smoke everywhere nobody passed that day some people were puking at the end i usually ran a 13  45 2 mile and i remember getting over 17 minutes i was gasping for air at the end we all thought the course was marked out incorrectly  but when we measured it later that day it was exactly 2 miles needless to say  nobody ever had any respiratory protection around these things  ever nor were we ever told we needed them i mean we had our gas masks in our gear  but nobody wanted to be  that guy  damn  we used to joke about it all the time whenever someone would start spewing some  war story   or when some freshoutabasic private would try to tell us about  that one time my drill sergeant made us do this  story   at the end we d say   yeah  but have you ever been to the burn pit    then we d laugh it off i guess it s not so funny anymore,8,
75530,my husband  half  jokes about the cancer he s going to get from the burn pits in afghanistan from what he described  they were horrible,7,
75531,this hits close to home we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight i really need to get this checked out,7,
75532,i can understand why burning trash and human waste may be unavoidable in certain military circumstances like in those remote outposts in afghanistan that might house 1520 people  there really are nt any good alternatives  however it seems less defensible to not have invested in better infrastructure once you had permanent bases the size of small cities  once you re at the point where soldiers had their own little airconditioned houses made out of cargo containers with air conditioning  satellite television  and onbase burger king it seems like you can probably invest in some proper trash incinerators instead of open burn pits,7,
75533,gt  though the us government disputes it well  color me surprised,8,
75534,a tsgt i know died recently from cancer he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family he was 32 his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer,7,
75535, support our troops with a ribbon sticker   that will definitely make up for all the fucked up shit the government puts them through,7,
75536,not surprised saw a guy in the va who used to jog through the base with his unitteam  not sure of the terminology   breathing in the smoke from one of these every day for 4 years he had some chronic lung condition we were working up  and said a couple of his buddies also have lung problems now otherwise perfectly healthy 40 years old  completely unnecessary illness due to stupidity andor apathy,6,
75537,http  wwwpublichealthvagovexposurescamplejeune for decades  the government knowingly allowed service members and their dependents to consume contaminated tap water fifteen diseases are recognized to have a direct relation to the contamination but many more are cropping up yet the government wo nt recognize those  yet   and they re filing motions to have claims tossed out based on statute of limitations  even though the government did nt even announce the contamination until over a decade after the wells were closed  this is nt just an agent orange or iraq war contamination where soldiers were exposed and have problems babies born at the base hospital hadhave an alarmingly high rate of birth defects but nothing is being done about it and the va continues to deny claims we ll just go ahead and add this one to the list,6,
75538,uhh i ve had a severe cough for 34 years now  since coming back from afghanistan  it ll get so bad  that i ll cough until i throw up  and then cough more  the va said it was normal i m sure they know what they re talking about i feel fine,6,
75539,i remember having to sit through a 2 hour briefing the first week i arrived in iraq  back in 2008 we were told that scientists verified that the burn pit on base was not a detriment to our health  then we had to sign forms when i returned stateside  there were quite a few reports of people having respiratory issues after returning from deployment  the va also denied that any illnesses were related to desert storm it took a long time for anyone other than veterans to admit that desert storm syndrome was a real thing  and then said veterans had to go through the gauntlet of proving their illnesses were related to their deployment,7,
75540,goddamn  it s unbelievable the way vets are treated shame,6,
75541,government does nt give a fuck about veterans,5,
75542,my 36yo buddy was just diagnosed with nonhodgkens lymphoma when he visited the va to do the paperwork they asked what bases he served at overseas  and literally had a list of diseases to reference per base just got a  yep  here it is probably from the burn pit  from the clerk thumbing down the list when he told me i was blown away  why is nt there any followup with soldiers who served at these bases    even a simple  you may want to get screened  when he returned from service would have given us some hope of getting in front of it it s incredibly irritating,5,
75543,the us lying about iraq and afghanistan  nah  never happen,7,
75544,do nt worry guys we ll take care of your medical needs when you come home oh wait,5,
75545,do nt forget area 51 they had burn pits like you would nt believe stealth materiels that had top secret components in them the poor guys that were exposed to all of this could nt even go for help  many died in secrecy  i know i was exposed to vaporized depleted uranium and who knows what else i have a sort of bet with my self that i ll die an early death,5,
75546,so  the dod did nt learn any lessons from previous burn pits  i mean  when you have to declassify area 51 because of workers health decline due to burn pits  you d think you d remember this shit is wrong,5,
75547, though he returned home safely in september 2009  he woke up one day a few months later with an inexplicable headache  numbness in his limbs and paralysis on one side of his body beau had suffered a mild stroke his health deteriorated  and he was diagnosed with brain cancer less than two years later  he died at the age of 46  holy fuck    fuck wars and politicians that start them,4,

75552,holy shit  my friend who was on the poop burning detail a bunch of times died of throat cancer earlier this year my first thought was it was the poop burning that did it  and i m concerned as well because i did my fair share of that as well,4,
75553,where we lived there was a burn pit that was nearby and the smoke would always float over to where we were  as of yet i dont have any symptoms but i do have a begine growth in my head  i have had it checked but i am paranoid that it could become bad ,4,
75554,little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did nt have to bother to actually lob chemicalbio weapons at us we d send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chembio bomb themselves  did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney,4,
75555,every time i allow myself a shred of regret for not enlisting  i remind myself that this kind of shit is what the us does to its soldiers fuck that i respect your service and all that  but fuck that shit,1,

75614,i have spent some time among the government arab workers of these nations and i have no pity for the trials that lie ahead of them in the real world  they wielded their unearned wealth with a brash arrogance  putting themselves above other races with a disgusting assumption that they were somehow favored by god  and therefore inherently better than others in fact  it was equally distasteful for them when an american did  not  wield their racenationality with a pompous arrogance because this undermined their own claim to legitimacy  this was not some single unpleasant person i dealt with it was the overwhelming majority out of 100 citizens  there were maybe 5 people who had enough wisdom and openmindedness to question such an absurd world view  for example  on a hot day i was supervising pakistani and indian workers doing our manual labor for us  as it would have been unbecoming for an arab and an american to be doing manual labor i took some of our cold water bottles we had in our cooler and offered them to the workers  but was stopped by one of the head guys  do nt do that   he warned me shaking his head his message was clear  he did nt want the workers to get used to that treatment  i witnessed minorities berated and even physically accosted at times only americans and british were spared from the cruel racism that pervades the arab world it seeps into your daily life and if you live in it long enough you even start to internalize it ugh  i am looking forward to the cold splash of reality to wash over that region and wake many of those intolerant people up from their slumber,7,

75618,have done some research in saudi echoing similar things everybody wants government jobs  but the government is trying to push private sector employment  so you end up with many saudis who do nt do anything showing up on payrolls and there s a somewhat true perception that most companies would prefer to hire foreigners  who will work harder  over citizens  not sure what the longterm solution is for the employment problems  but crashing oil revenue is definitely going to make things worse will be interesting to see if government is going to start shrinking public sector employment more heavily,5,

75632,from the regressive left s perspective  by censoring and silencing opposing opinions  especially those from sources merely  perceived  as not being   progressive   regressive enough  they are allowing for  traditionally oppressed groups  to   be used as a mouthpiece that ca nt be challenged because of cries of racism   speak  just as long as they say the correct    progressive   regressive things ,,

75679,this hits close to home we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight i really need to get this checked out,7,
75680,i can understand why burning trash and human waste may be unavoidable in certain military circumstances like in those remote outposts in afghanistan that might house 1520 people  there really are nt any good alternatives  however it seems less defensible to not have invested in better infrastructure once you had permanent bases the size of small cities  once you re at the point where soldiers had their own little airconditioned houses made out of cargo containers with air conditioning  satellite television  and onbase burger king it seems like you can probably invest in some proper trash incinerators instead of open burn pits,7,
75681,gt  though the us government disputes it well  color me surprised,8,
75682,a tsgt i know died recently from cancer he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family he was 32 his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer,7,
75683, support our troops with a ribbon sticker   that will definitely make up for all the fucked up shit the government puts them through,7,
75684,not surprised saw a guy in the va who used to jog through the base with his unitteam  not sure of the terminology   breathing in the smoke from one of these every day for 4 years he had some chronic lung condition we were working up  and said a couple of his buddies also have lung problems now otherwise perfectly healthy 40 years old  completely unnecessary illness due to stupidity andor apathy,6,
75685,http  wwwpublichealthvagovexposurescamplejeune for decades  the government knowingly allowed service members and their dependents to consume contaminated tap water fifteen diseases are recognized to have a direct relation to the contamination but many more are cropping up yet the government wo nt recognize those  yet   and they re filing motions to have claims tossed out based on statute of limitations  even though the government did nt even announce the contamination until over a decade after the wells were closed  this is nt just an agent orange or iraq war contamination where soldiers were exposed and have problems babies born at the base hospital hadhave an alarmingly high rate of birth defects but nothing is being done about it and the va continues to deny claims we ll just go ahead and add this one to the list,6,
75686,uhh i ve had a severe cough for 34 years now  since coming back from afghanistan  it ll get so bad  that i ll cough until i throw up  and then cough more  the va said it was normal i m sure they know what they re talking about i feel fine,6,
75687,i remember having to sit through a 2 hour briefing the first week i arrived in iraq  back in 2008 we were told that scientists verified that the burn pit on base was not a detriment to our health  then we had to sign forms when i returned stateside  there were quite a few reports of people having respiratory issues after returning from deployment  the va also denied that any illnesses were related to desert storm it took a long time for anyone other than veterans to admit that desert storm syndrome was a real thing  and then said veterans had to go through the gauntlet of proving their illnesses were related to their deployment,7,
75688,goddamn  it s unbelievable the way vets are treated shame,6,
75689,government does nt give a fuck about veterans,5,
75690,my 36yo buddy was just diagnosed with nonhodgkens lymphoma when he visited the va to do the paperwork they asked what bases he served at overseas  and literally had a list of diseases to reference per base just got a  yep  here it is probably from the burn pit  from the clerk thumbing down the list when he told me i was blown away  why is nt there any followup with soldiers who served at these bases    even a simple  you may want to get screened  when he returned from service would have given us some hope of getting in front of it it s incredibly irritating,5,
75691,the us lying about iraq and afghanistan  nah  never happen,7,
75692,do nt worry guys we ll take care of your medical needs when you come home oh wait,5,
75693,do nt forget area 51 they had burn pits like you would nt believe stealth materiels that had top secret components in them the poor guys that were exposed to all of this could nt even go for help  many died in secrecy  i know i was exposed to vaporized depleted uranium and who knows what else i have a sort of bet with my self that i ll die an early death,5,
75694,so  the dod did nt learn any lessons from previous burn pits  i mean  when you have to declassify area 51 because of workers health decline due to burn pits  you d think you d remember this shit is wrong,5,
75695, though he returned home safely in september 2009  he woke up one day a few months later with an inexplicable headache  numbness in his limbs and paralysis on one side of his body beau had suffered a mild stroke his health deteriorated  and he was diagnosed with brain cancer less than two years later  he died at the age of 46  holy fuck    fuck wars and politicians that start them,4,
75696,the us govt so cares about its troops,7,
75697,i ve known military to have permanent letters added to their medical records saying they have been exposed to the worst man made hazarddisaster since chernobyl,4,
75698,does kaf still have the shit pond  on another note  im going to have this checked out the va has this on their website somewhere  they sent an email,4,
75699,there are so many things wrong with this i do nt even know what to say  let s just purposefully burn hazardous material  petroleum products  chemicals  and batteries next to our camp oh  and throw some explosives in there while you re at it and vaporizes all that shit so we can breath it in are you kidding me,4,
75700,holy shit  my friend who was on the poop burning detail a bunch of times died of throat cancer earlier this year my first thought was it was the poop burning that did it  and i m concerned as well because i did my fair share of that as well,4,
75701,where we lived there was a burn pit that was nearby and the smoke would always float over to where we were  as of yet i dont have any symptoms but i do have a begine growth in my head  i have had it checked but i am paranoid that it could become bad ,4,
75702,little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did nt have to bother to actually lob chemicalbio weapons at us we d send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chembio bomb themselves  did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney,4,
75703,every time i allow myself a shred of regret for not enlisting  i remind myself that this kind of shit is what the us does to its soldiers fuck that i respect your service and all that  but fuck that shit,1,
75704,every goddamn war the military has to do something that exposes troops to dangerous chemicals,3,
75705,makes me wonder  i was at camp addertallil back in 2010  2011  what was i exposed to,3,
75706,i was in taji in 2011 2 people got cancer after our deployment  lots of people were having breathing problems we were right next to the tank graveyard and the burn pit was constantly going in our rush to shut down theater i ve gotten lung infections every year since then,3,
75707,just like at area 51  same shit never changes,3,

75739,i hope they get it right and protest the us department of education if student loans are your issue  go straight to the source of your ills ironically enough  the only way to end student debt is to scale down and eventually eliminate the student loan program,7,
75740, protesters lose jobs for not showing up to work  arrested for nonpayment,7,
75741,i see payday loans taking this route soon,5,
75742,did nt we get rid of debtor s prisons  i m confuse,4,
75743,i believe this happened as i heard this story from other news sources  but some info had to be left out or missing in the us if you owe money on a debt the personcompany has seven years to collect if they do nt the debt disappears if they take you to court and get a judgement they have ten years to collect and it can be renewed for ten more years the only way he could be arrested is if the loan company took him to court  won a judgement and then took further action to force the debtor to court this would not be something to come out of the blue,3,

75748,good  the prosecution seems to have a solid basis for a case this is one that should definitely go to trial the defense is going to have a tough time with all the press coverage cosby s been getting over these allegations,1,
75749,kanye tweeted cosby is innocen,1,
75751,just wait until they get their   1495 outage restoration surcharge  on the next bill,9,
75752,comcast   so what  it s not like you can leave me,9,
75753,comcast is used to pissing people off they wo nt give a fuck,9,
75754,you could probably just sticky this post  have no link from it or replies available that is how permanent of an issue this is,9,
75755,we want google fiber and we want it now,9,
75756,if a telephone company has this large a problem  they have to meet with the fcc and show cause most likely there would also be a hefty fine but  not cable networks because they are deemed nonessential,7,
75757,not news to me i have a 3 hour outage at least once a month with comcast a 1020 minute outage daily around 56 am  and at least 34 10 minute outages sprinkled throughout the week  i know this because 2 out of every 5 or 6 dvr recorded shows are fucked up during the middle   absolutely awful i live in a moderate city  too  so it s not like i m in the middle of fucking nowhere,7,
75758,and then they wonder why people are ready to go to google fibe,7,
75759,loss of internet and television access for 3 days would cause mass panic and riot,8,
75760,my bad people i went over my 300gb and used way too much of an infinite resource,7,
75761,wow  17k outages nationwide for as much as 3 hours  obama needs to step in and fix this for sure ,9,
75762,gt  across us i bet i could find thousands who are angry at comcast  in my town alone ,5,
75763,i m fully expecting to get downvoted to hell here  but what the heck  i m not particularly fond of comcast  but unless i missed something here  which is entirely possible   this does nt actually sound like it was particularly horrific for people in general it sounds like a very small fraction of their nationwide customer base  had an outage of parts of their service for about 3 or 4 hours  not even all of their service  but things like they could nt access their hd channels  or their internet did nt work for a few hours  i understand for businesses  an internet outage can be a big deal  so some outrage on their part would be justified  but for the general consumer  come on  get a grip go read a book for a while  or go outside for a bit  or  gasp  go do something with your family  i m just not getting what the huge deal was here  what am i missing,7,
75764,i was part of the outage did nt have internet and only had access to about 8 sd channels i ll be honest  3 hours where i have to use my phone for internetsi could nt care less had to go out and shovel anyway  edit  couldgt  could n,7,
75765,not a fan of comcast  but with this outage they probably still provide 9999  uptime bunch of whiners  yes  i work in it,6,
75766,i like how this is news in this country,7,
75767,comcast angers me even without outages,7,
75768,the words  anger  and  comcast  come up often,4,
75769,there needs to be legally mandated uptime and speed requirements  95  of the time your connection must reach the  advertised  speed  no more  up to xmbps  allowed  and 99  of the time it must reach 14 of that speed if this is nt met then customers must be completely refunded for that month,4,
75770,is anyone else still completely fucking down  just everything  been down for 15 hours here,4,
75771,quote from the article   comcast has more than 27 million customers  and 89000 of those are new cable subscribers the company signed on last quarter that was its best performance in eight years  correct me if i m wrong but are nt there 2 choices for most people  sign up with comcast or do nt have high speed internet  it s like bragging because people choose to eat food from the only supplier rather than starve to death,4,
75772,comcast seems to be an isp that people love to hate  charter got so bad for so many years that i loved to hate them in all honesty  the past three to four years or so they have been great,7,
75773,customer service replied   working as intended,3,
75774,i ve had comcast xfinity for almost 2 years now and i ve never had an issue,5,
75775,fun story i was at a friend s place watching the superbowl in denver comcast blacked out cbs with 1 minute 26 seconds left on the clock in second quarter  and service was nt restored till about 15 seconds before 3rd quarter kicked off  idk how widespread this was but lots of denverites did nt get to see the super bowl halftime show i d imagine comcast would lose a lot of money if their advertisers paid to have a certain amount of views and one of the biggest markets  since denver was participating in the super bowl  cut out all views during the entire halftime show idk how their whole contract with that stuff goes though  i hear i did nt miss much though,1,
75776,that s what happens things go out sometimes,3,
75777,friend of mine called to ask why he couldnt connect  he obviously cant check if there are outages in his neighborhood without the internet  he calls them and they offer to send a tech to his house for like  80  they didnt tell him the price  but you know itd be up there  he spends an hour checking all his connections  digging through paperwork to find his modem settings page  finally calls back about 8hrs later hoping to talk to someone else and theyre like   oh yeah  there s an outage in your area   idiots,1,
75778,when i called  i was disconnected 3 times this is great customer nonservice beside the lack of tv thanks comcast for helping me make my change from you  easier,1,
75779,it s nothing new that comcast absolutely sucks,1,
75780,when you deal with technology  there is only one thing i can guarantee you it will get down at the worst possible time,1,
75781, compact angers thousands across the us for something other than just being comcast for once  ftf,1,
75782,they just put a data cap on my home internet how fucked is that  pretty fucked if you ask me,1,
75783,what is the most troubling about comcast is that when there is an outtage  it doesnt effect just a small region  but instead downs multiple states that seems so rediculous,1,
75784,once they fix the outage you re left with  comcast anger thousands across us,1,
75785,now only 1000 years to lrrr ruler of the planet omicron persei 8 comes to destroy earth,1,
75786,it s not like we re losing  that  much more bandwidth it s only like 20 megs less than what we had before which was only 80 megs less than what we re paying for,1,
75787,so  i had to get comcast recently because i moved and noticed something weird about my bill the letter in the mail has a different due date than the due date that shows up on the online account just saying folks make sure to pay 2 days before your date at least,1,
75788,just having comcast in general makes them angry,1,
75789, nsfw how comcast really feels   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  kmcny_pixdw,1,
75790,once in a while fios is out for a few hours hard to get too pissed  these things do happen i do nt think comcast needs an outage to be hated honestly though for me they were a decent provider  i never had a single issue with them except for the occasional outage,1,
75791,wow now that s comcastic,1,
75792,it was out for like 3 hours jesus christ,1,
75793,my comcast service  for the first time in years  has actually been pretty good lately but i d like to pay less  so i m rooting for google fiber to come to boston simply so i can reap the benefits of competition  i mean  that s what we really want  right  we do nt want yet another monopoly  no matter how  altruistic  we think google will be  we want the existing monopolies to be forced into providing quality service for a reasonable price  along with other choices,1,
75794,it probably still worked better than my centurylink ds,1,
75795,comcast s response   it pays the restoration fee  or else it gets the hose again,1,
75796,my case  as in many others  boils down to this  you can pay triple the amount for the same throughput speeds or you can curse comcast and wait for google fiber,1,
75797,at the same time  i would nt want to be on the other end and get screamed at from 10k  people experiencing the outage i just went out instead of being at home it s aggregating that it happens so often  at the same time there are other things to d,1,
75798,they should just switch providers if they are nt satisfied  see what i did there ,1,
75799,after this comcast will just be turning off their services everywhere after all  they could save a ton of money that way,1,
75800,for comcast  it was tuesday,1,
75801,spread your cheeks  most of you wo nt even complain or ask for a billing credit,1,
75802,title should just be  comcast angers thousands across us   i fucking hate comcast with every fiber of my being  reasons  i  paying top dollar for slow as shit internet  ii  a modemrouter combo that broadcasts an unsecured public network from your home which has to be manually deactivated  iib  said modem has to be forced reset once a week  and doing so undoes the manual changes you made to get rid of the second network  iii  arbitrary data caps  iv  live television that freezes  v  ondemand that works infrequently  and turns into minecraft porn when it crashes  vi  customer  service  that refuses to listen to what your problem is  but instead tries to upsell you on a more advanced package  one of my dreams is to live long enough to see this shit stain regional monoploy of a company implode upon itself  or be run straight into the fucking grave by google fiber,1,
75803,i always laugh at this shit until i remember i m with twc  the   second   worst rated isp in america,1,
75804,where i live i would love to have this proble,1,
75807,has nt he already had  like  two years to prevent this in the first place,7,
75808,lansing has actually dealt with this problem and their civil engineers have a solution which is both fast and more costeffective than traditional measures they connect the end of the new pipe to the old pipes so when they pull out the old pipe they simultaneously thread the new pipes into the existing space this speeds up the process and the people in lansing estimate with adequate training  involving them with the process in flint  and hiring enough crews it can be completed for flint in one year,7,
75809,this whole situation is a national embarrassment  and it makes my blood boil  but what does naacp have to do with city water  is it a race issue as well  i ve never seen the demographics on flint  come to think of it  maybe aspca should get involved  too i bet people are still feeding their pets city water no matter what  edit  i just think it should be about officials   doing their fucking jobs    framing it as a race issue might just come back to bite us  who knows how many towns are discreetly checking for  and finding  elevated lead  should it matter how many african americans live there  if so  how should officials proceed differently  will it result in a process of public relations triage  that prioritizes black communities  public officials just need to do their fucking jobs for the public they serve there s no need to complicate this with race,5,
75810,that s like threatening to get one of those online white house petitions going it does nt matter,1,
75811,fix flint s water pipes or they ll burn flint to the ground,3,
75812,i m all for getting this fixed as quickly as possible but i also do nt want something rushed either figure it out figure it out right,1,
75813,okayand then what  all of the protesting has nt done jack so far what s one more protest going to do  it s not going to make the state government move any faster  it s very clear that the government  at every level  is more concerned about covering itself a protest is nt going to change that,,
75814,sooooo glad i do nt live in flint  that place sounds like a complete disaster,,

75843,friend of mine called to ask why he couldnt connect  he obviously cant check if there are outages in his neighborhood without the internet  he calls them and they offer to send a tech to his house for like  80  they didnt tell him the price  but you know itd be up there  he spends an hour checking all his connections  digging through paperwork to find his modem settings page  finally calls back about 8hrs later hoping to talk to someone else and theyre like   oh yeah  there s an outage in your area   idiots,1,
75844,when i called  i was disconnected 3 times this is great customer nonservice beside the lack of tv thanks comcast for helping me make my change from you  easier,1,
75845,it s nothing new that comcast absolutely sucks,1,
75846,when you deal with technology  there is only one thing i can guarantee you it will get down at the worst possible time,1,
75847, compact angers thousands across the us for something other than just being comcast for once  ftf,1,
75848,they just put a data cap on my home internet how fucked is that  pretty fucked if you ask me,1,
75849,what is the most troubling about comcast is that when there is an outtage  it doesnt effect just a small region  but instead downs multiple states that seems so rediculous,1,
75850,once they fix the outage you re left with  comcast anger thousands across us,1,
75851,now only 1000 years to lrrr ruler of the planet omicron persei 8 comes to destroy earth,1,
75852,it s not like we re losing  that  much more bandwidth it s only like 20 megs less than what we had before which was only 80 megs less than what we re paying for,1,
75853,so  i had to get comcast recently because i moved and noticed something weird about my bill the letter in the mail has a different due date than the due date that shows up on the online account just saying folks make sure to pay 2 days before your date at least,1,
75854,just having comcast in general makes them angry,1,
75855, nsfw how comcast really feels   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  kmcny_pixdw,1,
75856,once in a while fios is out for a few hours hard to get too pissed  these things do happen i do nt think comcast needs an outage to be hated honestly though for me they were a decent provider  i never had a single issue with them except for the occasional outage,1,
75857,wow now that s comcastic,1,
75858,it was out for like 3 hours jesus christ,1,
75859,my comcast service  for the first time in years  has actually been pretty good lately but i d like to pay less  so i m rooting for google fiber to come to boston simply so i can reap the benefits of competition  i mean  that s what we really want  right  we do nt want yet another monopoly  no matter how  altruistic  we think google will be  we want the existing monopolies to be forced into providing quality service for a reasonable price  along with other choices,1,
75860,it probably still worked better than my centurylink ds,1,
75861,comcast s response   it pays the restoration fee  or else it gets the hose again,1,
75862,my case  as in many others  boils down to this  you can pay triple the amount for the same throughput speeds or you can curse comcast and wait for google fiber,1,
75863,at the same time  i would nt want to be on the other end and get screamed at from 10k  people experiencing the outage i just went out instead of being at home it s aggregating that it happens so often  at the same time there are other things to d,1,
75864,they should just switch providers if they are nt satisfied  see what i did there ,1,
75865,after this comcast will just be turning off their services everywhere after all  they could save a ton of money that way,1,
75866,for comcast  it was tuesday,1,
75867,spread your cheeks  most of you wo nt even complain or ask for a billing credit,1,
75868,title should just be  comcast angers thousands across us   i fucking hate comcast with every fiber of my being  reasons  i  paying top dollar for slow as shit internet  ii  a modemrouter combo that broadcasts an unsecured public network from your home which has to be manually deactivated  iib  said modem has to be forced reset once a week  and doing so undoes the manual changes you made to get rid of the second network  iii  arbitrary data caps  iv  live television that freezes  v  ondemand that works infrequently  and turns into minecraft porn when it crashes  vi  customer  service  that refuses to listen to what your problem is  but instead tries to upsell you on a more advanced package  one of my dreams is to live long enough to see this shit stain regional monoploy of a company implode upon itself  or be run straight into the fucking grave by google fiber,1,
75869,i always laugh at this shit until i remember i m with twc  the   second   worst rated isp in america,1,

75899,i think it s great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about what i do nt like is that there should nt even be an issue with funding for our monuments,4,
75900,if we re committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i m all for it,1,
75901,i wonder how many huge donations like this  maybe smaller  in the hundreds of thousands  have been made for national monuments pretty awesome someone did this wo reading the article  i have to imagine there s a good amount of rigmarole on the donor s end to ensure the donation goes to where the donor actually wanted govt accountability on any level in the us seems kind of weak lately,1,
75902,all right  a 15000sqft exhibit room underneathkind of like the one in fallout ,3,

75904,oh cool thanks  philanthropist guy,3,
75905,wow  what an honorable thing to do  while 99  of people in his position would spend the money on useless crap  this guy chooses to spend his money on something so selfless and so much bigger than himself  this guy is a good 1  e,,

75911,i certainly appreciate what david has done here but  with all due respect to david  most americans would rather not see financial industry groups  like the carlyle group  suck economic resources out ofaway from most americans instead  we d prefer to pay for these efforts through widespread  robust economic opportunities and the tax contributions they make possible millions of americans and this nation have been greatly diminished as a result of the business activities of groups  like the carlyle group  over several decades  because of grotesque incomewealth inequality  the odds of seeing successful businesspeople like david rubinstein are greatly diminished he only got where he was because of the social ladder that used to exist in this nation,,
75912,how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions,,
75913,it s gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface themfight to take them down,,

75960,one of these videos was sent to me many years ago  forwarded on a myspace page  yeah  many  years ago   they were trying to  raise awareness  when they sent it to me to help the people get caught  but all they really ended up doing was spreading that ghastly thing to more points of the internet i wo nt describe a single second of it  but suffice it to say that it s horrifying i ve never been able to remove the memory i ve been through a lot in my military career  and yet seeing a 2minute version of one of those videos was easily the most horrible thing i have ever witnessed,9,

75996,did nt we get rid of debtor s prisons  i m confuse,4,
75997,i believe this happened as i heard this story from other news sources  but some info had to be left out or missing in the us if you owe money on a debt the personcompany has seven years to collect if they do nt the debt disappears if they take you to court and get a judgement they have ten years to collect and it can be renewed for ten more years the only way he could be arrested is if the loan company took him to court  won a judgement and then took further action to force the debtor to court this would not be something to come out of the blue,3,

76019,the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison,5,
76020,are they only being killed for food  that s slaughter  if they are being killed for management purposes  that s called culling,7,
76021,it s population control  hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use,6,

76038,this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day,9,
76039,gt  one of the three men who escaped from a california jail last month had been charged with kidnapping a marijuana dispensary owner that they suspected had hidden large amounts of cash in the desert the man and his accomplices are accused of driving the dispensary owner out to the desert  torturing him and cutting off his penis  sheesh i m not carrying more than  10 in my wallet from now on  and that has nothing to do with the fact that i m broke,9,
76040,this is why they get robbed all the time out here no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys,7,
76041,ca nt these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us,8,
76042,there s a great documentary on netflix called  high profits  about a business in breckenridge  co right before full legalization took effect  one of the big issues was exactly this only being able to do business in cash from payroll to paying city taxes they had  120k in cash they had to just walk into the front of the city building with and that was just the first month alone  some of the people that make the drops to the shops are walking out with  10k in their pockets and no security at all it s terrifying,8,
76043,civil forfeiture time,6,
76044,ironically  it s also just flat out illegal to own large sums of money anything over a few hundred bucks  and the government can sieze that money  because the money committed the crime of intent to purchase narcotics,9,

76048,are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money,4,
76049,this war on cash is such bullshit  people carried cash until 12 years ago and it was perfectly fine  now they are trying to restrict flying with cash  purchasing with cash  seizing cash   the only problem is that the money is due on one day  they need to have the tax office take payment on any day of the week  so it s stacked,6,
76050,i wonder how negative interest rates  if implemented  would effect the marijuana business these value of the business would probably increase as they had large sums of cash on hand their credit worthiness would increase because they had something of value  cash  but they would be penalized for depositing that cash according to the recent imf working paper i wonder if they would become attractive targets for some banks to help capitalize their weak balance sheets,3,
76051,oh well let you do business  but you just wo nt be able to use any banks what a backwards ass countr,3,

76069,it s the same way in washington and colorado it s still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed,1,
76070,since the money cant be deposited into a bank would a good option to take be converting it into precious metals such as gold  you would still need to store the gold but that could be easily done in a safety deposit however unless you know where to go  getting that much gold could raise the attention of people you dont want raised to begin with it s not like in china or india  if you show up with a briefcase of cash and walk out with a smaller case of gold  no one really cares,1,

76100,they do not care what police do with them  they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them  edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create  that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all  they do not care about you you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle,8,

76117,gt  luckie  s new role will entail working with media organizations  as well as government organizations  to understand how they  re currently using reddit and what their needs are from the platform  luckie told me he  ll then take that feedback and build it into reddit  s product  with the goal of making reddit more accessible to a broader community of people  so reddit will listen to what they like and dislike and then hand feed us whaat they want us to hear no longer will it be us posting what we find interesting and up or down voting it for exposure as much as it is meant to be  that s what i am hearing just another nail,9,
76118,gt  the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do nt we have that subreddit already ,8,

76127,aka manipulator in chief,5,
76128,so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming and this was the great marketing that is killing them,6,

76131,it s about ethics in reddi,3,
76132,just read about how twitter is filtering political content of a particular kind good news for reddit  they re on their way to being another propaganda wing of the left,1,
76133,great  a news manager  amp  head of journalism  with the attention span of one sentence  and the intellectual depth of a drunk on a 24 hour train ride  note  reddit is a whore for anything that emanates out of the roman catholic ponzi generating pope s pie hole perhaps the new head of journalism  could find another criminal organization to support on reddit instead of the catholic church criminal empire,,
76135,gt  90 percent of government revenues are from oil  70 percent of working saudis are employed by the government  and even the private sector remains heavily dependent on government spending  haha that about sums up the structural problem right there,8,

76139,i have spent some time among the government arab workers of these nations and i have no pity for the trials that lie ahead of them in the real world  they wielded their unearned wealth with a brash arrogance  putting themselves above other races with a disgusting assumption that they were somehow favored by god  and therefore inherently better than others in fact  it was equally distasteful for them when an american did  not  wield their racenationality with a pompous arrogance because this undermined their own claim to legitimacy  this was not some single unpleasant person i dealt with it was the overwhelming majority out of 100 citizens  there were maybe 5 people who had enough wisdom and openmindedness to question such an absurd world view  for example  on a hot day i was supervising pakistani and indian workers doing our manual labor for us  as it would have been unbecoming for an arab and an american to be doing manual labor i took some of our cold water bottles we had in our cooler and offered them to the workers  but was stopped by one of the head guys  do nt do that   he warned me shaking his head his message was clear  he did nt want the workers to get used to that treatment  i witnessed minorities berated and even physically accosted at times only americans and british were spared from the cruel racism that pervades the arab world it seeps into your daily life and if you live in it long enough you even start to internalize it ugh  i am looking forward to the cold splash of reality to wash over that region and wake many of those intolerant people up from their slumber,7,

76142,gt  our main issue is that our university did not prepare us for the job market  gt  they  d get out of university and get a government job now you need an advanced degree  til us millennials are not the only ones that got a kick in the pants by the generation before them  however  the saudis did get their education for free  edit  punctuatio,7,
76143,have done some research in saudi echoing similar things everybody wants government jobs  but the government is trying to push private sector employment  so you end up with many saudis who do nt do anything showing up on payrolls and there s a somewhat true perception that most companies would prefer to hire foreigners  who will work harder  over citizens  not sure what the longterm solution is for the employment problems  but crashing oil revenue is definitely going to make things worse will be interesting to see if government is going to start shrinking public sector employment more heavily,5,

76154,i have been calling the helpline everyday for 2 weeks it is a recorded message saying call back later we are busy just then general va helpline,7,
76155,the problem with the va  like most other government agencies  is that there is no accountability when you ca nt fire workers who are lazy  negligent  or worthless  you end up with a disfunctional organization filled with lazy  negligent  and worthless people,7,
76156,yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country,4,
76157,i have a pretty easy solution  why do nt overflow suicide calls just get forwarded to the regular suicide hotline  s   sure its probably better to deal with someone specifically trained to deal with service men and women but anyone is better then a voicemail,6,
76158,that vm box is gon na get overloaded quic,3,
76159,pissing off trained military personnel seems like a dumb idea in the long ru,3,
76160,and sanders wants to make this available for everyone it s not the money that causes this agency to be this way it s the nature of the federal government,4,
76161,it is nt a secret that the va is understaffed that is the biggest issue with the va and if they had more funding for labor costs  they would be in a far better spot,1,
76162,i ve been getting this for over a month the one time i did connect  the estimated wait time was 55 minutes,1,
76163,started up telepsyche again trying to make some progress a pending appointment looms  and i am very much looking forward to it  until she calls me and tells me they re cancelling it  i get a couple of appoints out of them  and then someone is sick  or changes positions there s no way for me to develop a healthy trusting relationship with my therapist  this is not an effective way to heal  so fuck it i ll go till i burn out in a glorious explosion of give a fucks and poop,1,
76164,remember when the va story broke it was really big news and everyone was talking about it and it was front page on reddit  nothing s changed  stories keep coming out about how nothing s changed  but no one cares either because it s not new anymore  or because of politics  or maybe both i do nt know,1,
76165,can anyone explain why the va is so dysfunctional  in short  i do nt get it it seems like they have tons of money but ca nt get their shit together,1,
76166,tell me more about how universal healthcare will be awesome for the rest of us,,
76167,socialized healthcare no thanks,,
76168,governmentrun anything is a disaster,,
76170,interesting though   since 2005  texas has prosecuted 38 juveniles for intoxication manslaughter or intoxication assault only three were sent to the adult system  and half of all cases resulted in probation of some kind  i think this is more telling of the justice system  and accessibility to competent  quality counsel it s clear money buys better legal counsel  but if the government subsidized public defense more heavily  the outcomes would clearly be different,9,
76171,cash is king in the world of corruption,9,
76172,i said this somwhere else  but it s also pertinent here  everyone is equal under the law and money is how we measure that equality,9,
76173,the difference  money,9,
76174,it s almost like the rich live under different rules,8,
76175,this is standard practice in the us judicial system outcomes will vary from case to case depending on financial status there s actually a legal term for it  it s called   cream ,9,
76176,my mom has always said guilty until proven rich,8,
76177,i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law this is the american dream,8,
76178,and liberty and justice for all  who can afford it ,5,
76179,i love how this article just glosses over the fact that arellano had previous dui convictions which is why he did nt receive the same sentence  this was couch s first dui case which is why he got probation  as texas takes the rehab route  but whatever lets rage and ignore the fact,8,
76180,is everyone here honestly  seriously shocked that money gets you out of trouble  am i taking crazy pills,5,
76181,going beyond the dae legal system is corrupt  circlejerk in this thread  there are certainly some differences in these cases firstly  the arellano case  the other one in the article  happened in 2007  six years before couch s trial likewise  the article says that arellano had driven while intoxicated and drank underage before  which means that he would ve had a greater chance of being moved to an adult trial meanwhile  couch had no prior violations of the law  meaning that he could nt be moved to an adult court,6,
76182,i understand what you are trying to do with your anecdotal case comparisons however  they are nt comparable cases when you consider all the factors  including criminal history  but  even if you ignore all the other factors  i know of a white 20 yo male from a fairly wealthy family in my area who was sent to prison for a year based on a drunk driving accident so my anecdotal evidence shows similar punishment to your anecdotal case thereby anecdotally refuting your point,8,
76183,the real crime here those eyebrow,6,
76184,gee  it s almost like different judges and prosecutors in different areas with separate cases can lead to different verdicts or something,6,
76185,that s why the case became famous because he got away while guilty that was autocorrect capitalization,4,
76186,affluenza is just a fake term that means the following  if you are rich  you do nt go to jail if you are not  you will spend 10 years like 95  of americans,4,
76187,let s be clear what happened to the poor kid was what s supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone you fucking go to prison couch was the exception,7,
76188,he did nt go free he was on probation and then he violated that  so he s going to jail,8,
76189,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,3,
76190,if someone is brought up too rich to not know the difference between right and wrong  why can the same argument not be used for poor people who commit crimes  people who are brought up in poverty do nt really know right from wrong just as much as a kid who has rich parents,3,
76191,that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time,3,
76192,  sees title   probably not a rich white kid   clicks article   and yuuuuuuuuuup sm,3,
76193,prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win,3,
76194,obviously as white god intended,4,
76195,i fucking hate ethan couch  i mean look at that look on his face disgusting i mean even his name is stupid,5,
76196,horrible headline  38 cases of dui manslaughter in texas since 2005 and only 3 of them went to adult court  that tells you the vast majority of these cases are handled with kid glovesso picking out one of 3 that went the other route and comparing it to the affluenza case is disingenuous  but fuck it  that is what the media does today god forbid they instead do an article focusing on how in texas if you are a drunk driving kid that kills people you will get away with it 35 out of 38 time,4,
76197,it did nt seem to mention how they had the same judge  we ve already established this same judge would have been open to giving a similar sentence to a poor minority because she tried to do just that keep making this a race issue  though lord knows the media loves to stir up ignorant poor folks  also  anyone who comes to the us illegally and kills is citizens deserves little sympathy he was a juvenile  so it would be appropriate to release him and deport him  i do nt understand the need to distort issues to make tbem about race we already have enough problems it s already an established fact that those with the means to afford a lawyer fair better than those who do nt,3,
76198,the difference  money,1,
76199,did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window,1,
76200,by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time,1,
76201,excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did,1,
76202,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,1,
76203,lemmeguess ethnic  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they re ethnic,1,
76204,cash rules everything around me they have  and very good lawyers,1,
76205,well  on one hand you have a kid that killed 3 adults and a child in a crash  and on the other a kid who killed a mother and her  unborn child  in a crash in a conservative state so he could have mowed down 10 born people and probably got less than what he gets for  accidentally  killing 1 unborn baby,1,
76206,free public defender vs 2000  an hour lawyer,1,
76207,this affluenza thing still baffles me  doing bad things because money  with that sort of logic hobos must be saints and not the crack heads living under bridges,1,
76208,no shit  i mean was nt the entire outrage that similar cases normally lead to prison in the first place,1,
76209,seriously  the rich kid,1,
76210,that s what  affluenza  means literally the entire point of this case and why it s been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich,1,
76211,i say it like my grandma used to  money talks  bullshit walks,1,
76212,he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows wtf,1,
76213,there s actually a legal question that you asked,1,
76214,you do nt automatically get a dui in fact,1,
76215,biggest problem in the universe  vote it up  http  thebiggestproblemintheuniversecomepisode8,1,
76218,this is why a lot of former cops are setting up companies where they transport the cash for it it s also a huge motivation for the stores to keep 2 separate sets of books  a real one and one the irs gets to see,9,
76219,this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day,9,
76220,gt  one of the three men who escaped from a california jail last month had been charged with kidnapping a marijuana dispensary owner that they suspected had hidden large amounts of cash in the desert the man and his accomplices are accused of driving the dispensary owner out to the desert  torturing him and cutting off his penis  sheesh i m not carrying more than  10 in my wallet from now on  and that has nothing to do with the fact that i m broke,9,
76221,this is why they get robbed all the time out here no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys,7,
76222,ca nt these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us,8,
76223,there s a great documentary on netflix called  high profits  about a business in breckenridge  co right before full legalization took effect  one of the big issues was exactly this only being able to do business in cash from payroll to paying city taxes they had  120k in cash they had to just walk into the front of the city building with and that was just the first month alone  some of the people that make the drops to the shops are walking out with  10k in their pockets and no security at all it s terrifying,8,
76224,civil forfeiture time,6,
76225,ironically  it s also just flat out illegal to own large sums of money anything over a few hundred bucks  and the government can sieze that money  because the money committed the crime of intent to purchase narcotics,9,
76226,time to start using gold,6,
76227,so the tax man will gladly take cannadollars  but the banks will not this is ridiculously stupid,6,
76228,same deal in washington still have to buy my shit with cash oh but i can buy cigs and alcohol with a card no problem  if you want to pick up a gram here or there it s no problem  but i buy in bulk  since it s cheaper that means i need to stop by the bank to get  140 that s the only time i carry that much money on me  it s like requiring a personal check to get a passport no cashier s check  no card wtf it s 2016,8,
76229,are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money,4,
76230,this war on cash is such bullshit  people carried cash until 12 years ago and it was perfectly fine  now they are trying to restrict flying with cash  purchasing with cash  seizing cash   the only problem is that the money is due on one day  they need to have the tax office take payment on any day of the week  so it s stacked,6,
76231,i wonder how negative interest rates  if implemented  would effect the marijuana business these value of the business would probably increase as they had large sums of cash on hand their credit worthiness would increase because they had something of value  cash  but they would be penalized for depositing that cash according to the recent imf working paper i wonder if they would become attractive targets for some banks to help capitalize their weak balance sheets,3,
76232,oh well let you do business  but you just wo nt be able to use any banks what a backwards ass countr,3,
76233,this is a perfect storm for evil doers who seize this unfortunate opportunity all they would have to to do is steak out a caregiver facility i would hope something changes soon this is absurd and the last word of that article  like my post  is penis,3,
76234,they should accept bitcoin problem solved,3,

76333,arizona   republican   legislators want to subvert the will of the people ftf,7,
76334,sounds reasonable to me  more easily  is such a loaded headline current law states ballot measures need 34th of both chambers of legislature to overturn ballot measures no matter how narrowly they pass mesnard wants to amend the law so that the amount needed to overturn is proportional to the margin the measure passed  people want to sit here and think this is some republican ploy on the grounds of marijuana measures  but what happens if some sleazy right wing john kavanagh inspired measure gets through at 51   there are certainly 15 az senators who ll support it and thus it ca nt be changed  this bill gives parity to both sides of the aisle,,

76426,gt  luckie  s new role will entail working with media organizations  as well as government organizations  to understand how they  re currently using reddit and what their needs are from the platform  luckie told me he  ll then take that feedback and build it into reddit  s product  with the goal of making reddit more accessible to a broader community of people  so reddit will listen to what they like and dislike and then hand feed us whaat they want us to hear no longer will it be us posting what we find interesting and up or down voting it for exposure as much as it is meant to be  that s what i am hearing just another nail,9,
76427,gt  the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do nt we have that subreddit already ,8,

76468,so this guy is innocent until proven guilty right  why is this investigation so short  we do nt know the details  why does it take a year to investigate an officer for shooting someone  and this takes a couple of days to charge this guy  is that disconnect enough to make anyone here question things enough to accept that there is a massive encompassing problem with our legal system  i always have to wonder because we see many of the same people calling for people to wait for details after an officer shoots someone  telling us not to be monday morning quarterbacks then stories like this pop up and we have those same people frothing at the mouth in this situation where it has nt been given the year plus of investigation that an officer who shoots someone would be given the guy is already guilty despite the cries to give officers the benefit of the doubt because of the innocent until proven principle,,

76479,good for him  football does nt have to be a concussion prone sport it started as the american version of rugby  and evolved into the form we see today  and can just as properly evolve into something that is nt effectively a form of human sacrifice  part of how it evolved is the career of pop warner  the coach of the carlisle indian school he kept  how to put it  coaching like a lawyer  and coming up with clever ways to get an edge  that would then eb slapped down with rule changes  surely concussions justify rule changes too,7,
76480,i played football for 4 years in highschool started all 4 years i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fu,3,

76504,i have spent some time among the government arab workers of these nations and i have no pity for the trials that lie ahead of them in the real world  they wielded their unearned wealth with a brash arrogance  putting themselves above other races with a disgusting assumption that they were somehow favored by god  and therefore inherently better than others in fact  it was equally distasteful for them when an american did  not  wield their racenationality with a pompous arrogance because this undermined their own claim to legitimacy  this was not some single unpleasant person i dealt with it was the overwhelming majority out of 100 citizens  there were maybe 5 people who had enough wisdom and openmindedness to question such an absurd world view  for example  on a hot day i was supervising pakistani and indian workers doing our manual labor for us  as it would have been unbecoming for an arab and an american to be doing manual labor i took some of our cold water bottles we had in our cooler and offered them to the workers  but was stopped by one of the head guys  do nt do that   he warned me shaking his head his message was clear  he did nt want the workers to get used to that treatment  i witnessed minorities berated and even physically accosted at times only americans and british were spared from the cruel racism that pervades the arab world it seeps into your daily life and if you live in it long enough you even start to internalize it ugh  i am looking forward to the cold splash of reality to wash over that region and wake many of those intolerant people up from their slumber,7,

76508,have done some research in saudi echoing similar things everybody wants government jobs  but the government is trying to push private sector employment  so you end up with many saudis who do nt do anything showing up on payrolls and there s a somewhat true perception that most companies would prefer to hire foreigners  who will work harder  over citizens  not sure what the longterm solution is for the employment problems  but crashing oil revenue is definitely going to make things worse will be interesting to see if government is going to start shrinking public sector employment more heavily,5,

76539,compassionate side of me  fuuuuuuuck that s horrific  reddit side of me  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  sduux5fdys,,
76541,if the proposal came from a doctor or scientist  i would be 100  on the side of this bill but it comes from a senator  which makes me want to question it  scientific papers require peer review from the most qualified people to call bullshit on an idea before you can get it published as legitimate i m not saying i m questioning the idea  but i do nt know enough about the process of bills and laws to give it my automatic seal of approval  i think it s a good idea to administer anesthesia to an unborn human that can feel pain whether or not it increases the cost of abortion but the cost is still a talking point all i can do is hope that the people in charge of the decision in the end have the same concerns that i do,8,
76542,i mean  we already use anesthesia on fetuses when performing surgery in the womb for exactly this reason  so it s hardly surprising  http  wwwdoctorsonfetalpaincomfetalpaintheevidence5documentatio,7,
76543,wether a fetus is under anesthesia is completely dependent on the type of anesthetic being performed any general anesthetic also anesthetizes the fetus while other types like spinal or local do not even then  there is no accurate way to quantify or measure awareness in fetuses  much less adults undergoing anesthesia the body also still responds to pain under anesthesia  as its an autonomic response  so the definition of  feeling pain  is not something that should be measured i feel like awareness  which is impossible to measure in a fetus regardless  is a real idicator of humanity an easy solution would be to simply do all elective abortions under general anesthesia  which may cost more  but is easily doable i have no idea what the preferred method of anesthesia is  if any  for elective abortions  source  i do anesthesia in a catholic hospital,5,
76544,i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them,7,
76545,they have nt decided at what point of gestation this would happen  gt  montana lawmakers passed a similar law in 2015 requiring fetal anesthesia before surgeries  including abortion  after 20 or more gestational weeks  so  4 months the general consensus for viability outside the womb is around 6 monthsish for some the concept of consciousness coincides with viability outside the womb,6,
76546, this is a review on fetal pain   http  jamajamanetworkcomarticleaspx  articleid  201429amp  resultclick  1  from clinical review  although it is 10 years old it says  gt  evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques similarly  limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion,5,
76547,is nt this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor s office  would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder,5,
76548,ignorant people propose bill based on said ignorance,,
76549,i m going to talk about this as delicately as possible i  genuinely  want thoughts and opinions on this subject  i am asking that no one become immediately offended by what i m about to say rather than respond with your opinion telling me why you believe that my view should change i am childfree i do nt want kids  i m 35  so it s pretty much set in stone at this juncture in my life i do nt see myself as a prolife or prochoice supporter and the reason for that is because i kind of agree with both sides on one hand i firmly believe that the destruction of a human being  born or not  is murder it fits the definition  of  murder before you downvote me into oblivion  let me be clear it s not the votes i care about it s that you understand where i m coming from even though i have that belief  i also believe that some people were just not meant to be children but therein lies another debate  why do nt they place it in adoption  because most of the time unwanted children are kept  they re not placed into adoption and when they re kept their chances of being neglected as children  whether it be mentally  emotionally  or physically  rise exponentially i certainly would nt want to have a child and resent it i  do nt  have children because frankly i m mean as a damn snake i do nt see any part of me that could ever have a child and not lose my temper with it and i would nt put a kid through that  because  i  was put through that i would be a horrible parent  anyway  i have a point i swear if you re going to have an abortion  why anesthetize it first  do i believe that it can feel  absolutely  but you re killing it i mean it s not like you re putting it to sleep and saying   here  fight for your life  you re fucking killing it so why have a crisis of conscience about it  again  i m sorry if i offend anyone  that s not my intention i m just a realistic person and it is what it is sugarcoating it does nt change it the bill seems like a waste of time and tax dollars  edit  i do nt understand why this is being downvoted so  please  give me your views instead of leaving me wondering because if there s something i m not understanding it needs to be made clear again this is absolutely not about the votes rather than having a discussion,,
76550,if you pinch a fetus it will cry so that pretty much proves they feel pai,,
76551,because that makes it okay  smh,,
76553,this makes sense a lot of people in science fields relating to cancer formation  such as radiology and medicinal biology  are of the opinion that most cancerous tumors are actually quietly killed by the body before they can reach critical mass to defend themselves  and the ones that prove dangerous are the ones that either do nt register to t cells or which grow too quickly to be snuffed to simplify  the reasons for this are simple  not everyone dies from cancer  and everyone gets exposed to carcinogens given the rate of mutation  the influence of radiation  the amount of background radiation  etc  that everyone is unavoidably exposed to  we should all develop tumors if there is a true casual relationship if you simply say that the body is helpless against them naturally  we would all die from cancer the body  must  be defending itself from them given that we do nt  in fact  it s basically accepted as scientific truth cancer is nt simply the presence of cancerous tumors  it s the presence of cancerous tumors that have the right surrounding cells  in the right quantity  that do nt die from immune system intervention and which have favorable growth conditions most small tumors simply do nt have the right conditions  and die studies have confirmed that the ones that register as cancer are a subset of all tumors that might form  because this subset avoids the usual limiting factors  so  going back to the article  this is simply taking the bodies natural process for fighting tumors and guiding it to specific cancers it might normally miss and saying  go get it   then praying you did nt just kill the poor sap with his now manically overenthusiastic immune system,6,
76554,gt  the treatment involves removing the tcells from patients  tagging them with  receptor  molecules that target cancer  and putting them back into the body in an infusionthe targeting molecules  known as chimeric antigen receptors or cars  came from specially bred genetically engineered mice   gt  in one study  94 percent of participants suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia  all  said their symptoms vanished completely after they were treated with the modified blood cells  known as tcells  it looks like this could be a very  very big deal i m surprised that  as of this comment  this post is not getting much attention,7,
76555,now they just need to find a way to reverse liver cirrhosis and i can live forever,1,
76556,this is a breakthrough right up until the pharmaceutical companies buy the process and tuck it away forever  there s no money to be made in curing a disease,1,
76557,i m rather hopeful that we ll be able to cure most cancers within the next 20 years or so  and hopefully before that we ll have something that wo nt cure it but will reliably halt cancer so that a patient can just wait for the actual cure to be found  as with we do with hiv i believe  maybe i m being too optimistic  but you got ta be optimistic about something in this miserable world,1,
76559,thats bad news for all the 711 in our town that take the,8,
76560,does nt this just translate into fewer places for poor people to buy food,7,
76561, 711 cashiers will now have to ring up cigarettes as organic kale instead of hot pockets,7,
76562,on the other hand  if the business stops taking food stamps entirely  not only can they not get the kale you want to make them eat  but they also ca nt get a loaf of bread or gallon of milk unless they start selling their food stamps to get cash to buy the milk and bread so the business still makes their money  the amount of food stamp fraud goes up  and the poor that you claim to be helping are getting even less food  healthy or otherwise  because of the food stampcash exchange rate,4,
76563,why are nt food stamps like wic  with wic you get vouchers for specific food items these items cover the basic food groups and align with a certain amount of nutritional value  meanwhile  you can buy friggin monster energy drinks with food stamps that makes no sense  regardless if you are looking at it from a healthy standpoint or a taxpayer standpoint,6,
76564,if obesity and other nutrition related issues are such a problem among the poor  would nt it be more cost effective to do away with food stamps and implement something like a food box program instead  in other words would the cost of labor to package and ship prepared food boxes in bulk to grocery stores and distribution centers be offset by what would be saved in reduced healthcare costs  imagine a program where you list the people in your household  any allergies or specific requirements and a box is prepared to supplement your family for a week it could contain things like rice  beans  canned or pouched goods like meats  vegetables and fruits  dried oatmeal and cereals  powdered milk  cooking oil every month they could receive a selection of 5 spices  salt and pepper and even a recipe pamphlet if in addition to the box  they started a program where grocery stores and produce growers could drop off older or bruised produce  people could pick some up for free when they picked up their boxes,7,
76565,what if the healthy foods do nt sell  are they still forced to stock them  would nt you think the actual grocers in the neighborhood would have a better sense of what their customers want than the federal government,4,

76569,honestly this will be great  the state  should  be very involved in what people eat for free,1,
76570,another  good intention  bad policy,1,
76571,this is the dark side of welfare  the constitution is completely circumvented the government has the power to cajole and pressure when it is putting stipulations on the money it gave out the government is capable of doing things it would never have the power of doing otherwise  like forcing a business to carry certain products  or forcing a person to apply for jobs or eventually  forcing people to work at government labor jobs,1,
76572,because dontravious demands fresh cilantro,3,
76573,i wonder how much crime in a store would go down if the store was no longer food stamp approved,1,

76594,gt  across us i bet i could find thousands who are angry at comcast  in my town alone ,5,
76595,i m fully expecting to get downvoted to hell here  but what the heck  i m not particularly fond of comcast  but unless i missed something here  which is entirely possible   this does nt actually sound like it was particularly horrific for people in general it sounds like a very small fraction of their nationwide customer base  had an outage of parts of their service for about 3 or 4 hours  not even all of their service  but things like they could nt access their hd channels  or their internet did nt work for a few hours  i understand for businesses  an internet outage can be a big deal  so some outrage on their part would be justified  but for the general consumer  come on  get a grip go read a book for a while  or go outside for a bit  or  gasp  go do something with your family  i m just not getting what the huge deal was here  what am i missing,7,
76596,i was part of the outage did nt have internet and only had access to about 8 sd channels i ll be honest  3 hours where i have to use my phone for internetsi could nt care less had to go out and shovel anyway  edit  couldgt  could n,7,
76597,not a fan of comcast  but with this outage they probably still provide 9999  uptime bunch of whiners  yes  i work in it,6,
76598,i like how this is news in this country,7,
76599,comcast angers me even without outages,7,
76600,the words  anger  and  comcast  come up often,4,
76601,there needs to be legally mandated uptime and speed requirements  95  of the time your connection must reach the  advertised  speed  no more  up to xmbps  allowed  and 99  of the time it must reach 14 of that speed if this is nt met then customers must be completely refunded for that month,4,
76602,is anyone else still completely fucking down  just everything  been down for 15 hours here,4,
76603,quote from the article   comcast has more than 27 million customers  and 89000 of those are new cable subscribers the company signed on last quarter that was its best performance in eight years  correct me if i m wrong but are nt there 2 choices for most people  sign up with comcast or do nt have high speed internet  it s like bragging because people choose to eat food from the only supplier rather than starve to death,4,
76604,comcast seems to be an isp that people love to hate  charter got so bad for so many years that i loved to hate them in all honesty  the past three to four years or so they have been great,7,
76605,customer service replied   working as intended,3,
76606,i ve had comcast xfinity for almost 2 years now and i ve never had an issue,5,
76607,fun story i was at a friend s place watching the superbowl in denver comcast blacked out cbs with 1 minute 26 seconds left on the clock in second quarter  and service was nt restored till about 15 seconds before 3rd quarter kicked off  idk how widespread this was but lots of denverites did nt get to see the super bowl halftime show i d imagine comcast would lose a lot of money if their advertisers paid to have a certain amount of views and one of the biggest markets  since denver was participating in the super bowl  cut out all views during the entire halftime show idk how their whole contract with that stuff goes though  i hear i did nt miss much though,1,
76608,that s what happens things go out sometimes,3,
76609,friend of mine called to ask why he couldnt connect  he obviously cant check if there are outages in his neighborhood without the internet  he calls them and they offer to send a tech to his house for like  80  they didnt tell him the price  but you know itd be up there  he spends an hour checking all his connections  digging through paperwork to find his modem settings page  finally calls back about 8hrs later hoping to talk to someone else and theyre like   oh yeah  there s an outage in your area   idiots,1,
76610,when i called  i was disconnected 3 times this is great customer nonservice beside the lack of tv thanks comcast for helping me make my change from you  easier,1,
76611,it s nothing new that comcast absolutely sucks,1,
76612,when you deal with technology  there is only one thing i can guarantee you it will get down at the worst possible time,1,
76613, compact angers thousands across the us for something other than just being comcast for once  ftf,1,
76614,they just put a data cap on my home internet how fucked is that  pretty fucked if you ask me,1,
76615,what is the most troubling about comcast is that when there is an outtage  it doesnt effect just a small region  but instead downs multiple states that seems so rediculous,1,
76616,once they fix the outage you re left with  comcast anger thousands across us,1,
76617,now only 1000 years to lrrr ruler of the planet omicron persei 8 comes to destroy earth,1,
76618,it s not like we re losing  that  much more bandwidth it s only like 20 megs less than what we had before which was only 80 megs less than what we re paying for,1,
76619,so  i had to get comcast recently because i moved and noticed something weird about my bill the letter in the mail has a different due date than the due date that shows up on the online account just saying folks make sure to pay 2 days before your date at least,1,
76620,just having comcast in general makes them angry,1,
76621, nsfw how comcast really feels   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  kmcny_pixdw,1,
76622,once in a while fios is out for a few hours hard to get too pissed  these things do happen i do nt think comcast needs an outage to be hated honestly though for me they were a decent provider  i never had a single issue with them except for the occasional outage,1,
76623,wow now that s comcastic,1,
76624,it was out for like 3 hours jesus christ,1,
76625,my comcast service  for the first time in years  has actually been pretty good lately but i d like to pay less  so i m rooting for google fiber to come to boston simply so i can reap the benefits of competition  i mean  that s what we really want  right  we do nt want yet another monopoly  no matter how  altruistic  we think google will be  we want the existing monopolies to be forced into providing quality service for a reasonable price  along with other choices,1,
76626,it probably still worked better than my centurylink ds,1,
76627,comcast s response   it pays the restoration fee  or else it gets the hose again,1,
76628,my case  as in many others  boils down to this  you can pay triple the amount for the same throughput speeds or you can curse comcast and wait for google fiber,1,
76629,at the same time  i would nt want to be on the other end and get screamed at from 10k  people experiencing the outage i just went out instead of being at home it s aggregating that it happens so often  at the same time there are other things to d,1,
76630,they should just switch providers if they are nt satisfied  see what i did there ,1,
76631,after this comcast will just be turning off their services everywhere after all  they could save a ton of money that way,1,
76632,for comcast  it was tuesday,1,
76633,spread your cheeks  most of you wo nt even complain or ask for a billing credit,1,
76634,title should just be  comcast angers thousands across us   i fucking hate comcast with every fiber of my being  reasons  i  paying top dollar for slow as shit internet  ii  a modemrouter combo that broadcasts an unsecured public network from your home which has to be manually deactivated  iib  said modem has to be forced reset once a week  and doing so undoes the manual changes you made to get rid of the second network  iii  arbitrary data caps  iv  live television that freezes  v  ondemand that works infrequently  and turns into minecraft porn when it crashes  vi  customer  service  that refuses to listen to what your problem is  but instead tries to upsell you on a more advanced package  one of my dreams is to live long enough to see this shit stain regional monoploy of a company implode upon itself  or be run straight into the fucking grave by google fiber,1,
76635,i always laugh at this shit until i remember i m with twc  the   second   worst rated isp in america,1,
76636,where i live i would love to have this proble,1,
76639,that article is really light on details  does anyone know why this happened  did the guy not respond to a court summons or something along those lines  is nt a default the judgement the usual result in that situation,9,
76640,this happened in feb  2003 in minnesota as well  article   http  wwwmndailycom20030214usmarshalsarreststudentloandebtorstwincities,9,
76641,what happens if you literally ca nt pay your loans  asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11  just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job  edit  something a lot of you do nt seem to realize is that these were private loans there s no forgiveness with those,9,
76642,not really too much context given here  so it s hard to guess at the actual situation  but federal student loans  at least direct loans and the majority of those older loans passed back to fsa as they phased out the guarantee programs  do nt get sold to private collection agencies at this time maybe that part happened a while back  before current policies went into place and the collectors are taking advantage of the protections that federallyoriginated loans have  anyway  for people who are interested in learning more about how defaulted federal student loans are being collected today   check this out   https  wwwfbogovindex  s  opportunityamp  mode  formamp  id  216a8418f8e71f0c9c3475946ab100f8amp  tab  coreamp  _cview  1  they re currently in the middle of contracting new private collection agencies to service defaulted loans and you can see in the rfp documents how agencies are being scored and how that ties into account assignments  basically  for those who do nt feel like running through all of it  the big emphasis for student loan collections now is getting people through affordable rehabilitation options and into incomedriven repayment plans placements look like they re going to be based about 50  on careful regulatory compliance and borrower satisfaction surveys  which would make it extremely difficult for high pressure collections tactics to work out in the long run  none of that changes this story  just thought it was interesting in light of some of the comments i ve read that indicate people believe strongarm collection tactics for student loans will always be the norm  tldr  they re at least trying to throw a friendly paint job over the horribly broken federal student loan system these days,9,
76643,if you dont show up to court after you have been served this is what happens he has been ignoring collection attempts  he got served and ignored that too im not in favor of this man being arrested but you cant ignore court summons if you get served you have to go,9,
76644,upconwell said it best  gt  you are reading way to much into the article no one said they were violent no one said they had their guns drawn they are us marshals  they carry guns  every god damn day   gt  they probably went to his door  knocked he answered and they said  hey  we have a warrant for you for failing to appear in a federal court   he probably said  oh shit let me get some pants  gt  no violence  no guns drawn  everything was pretty standard and nonviolent  gt  plus  it should be noted that he was not arrested for failing to pay student loans  he was arrested for violating a court order,9,
76645,how do you not pay a  1500 loan after 30 friggin years,9,
76646,gt  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  this almost reads like satire,9,
76647,i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors,9,
76648,where in this article did it say  guns drawn  as most people are stating here  it says  with guns   every on duty us marshal goes through their day  with guns   someone signed a contract for a loan  and then spends almost three decades not paying it i agree that a police force should nt have been used there are financial measures that can be taken upon default of a loan rather than criminal  but i m really surprised by the circle jerk that s happening over a fox news article,9,
76649,can i get a misleading title please,8,
76650,you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day,6,
76651,lol  you guys are so gullible the guy dodged this debt and refused to engage the proper authorities for 25 years this is nt a new college graduate that missed one payment then you have the cascade of predictable posts stating  boot lickers    debtors prison  and how in 30 years this will be the watershed moment we all look back to as we are enslaved by the government this is a statement case the feds took an extreme example and made an extreme example of this putz the goal of this action is compliance and to get folks to not ignore their obligations the money spent on this will scare the other million folks that are past due to actually pick up the phone and engage them to resolve the debt no one held a gun to this guy s head to sign up for the student loans and no one was stopping him for 25 years from making a payment plan for the remaining  1500 this guy deserved it and as a tax payer this is ok by me,9,
76652,real story here dude was sued by the united state of america  he refused to appear  a default judgment was issued against him  he refused to appear for postjudgment depositions  judge issued an order directing him to appear in court  he ignored it and then the judge issued an arrest warrantincareration order and federal judges use us marshalls to enforce their orders  so he was nt arrested for having old student loans he was arrested for refusing to comply with a direct order from the judge  http  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386htm,8,
76653,that dude could not come up with  1500 in 29 years,8,
76654, a few years ago congress allowed the private sector to contract for student loan collections and so you have these private companies who are doing this  i find this scary  even though i have no student loans to pay off they dragged this dude to court and made him sign an agreement in front of their private attorney he had no attorney present  and was nt read any rights  edit  quote is from the video,9,
76655,forever grateful i graduated with minimal student loans ca nt ignore bills for 25 years though  regardless of what those payments stem from from reading through the comments here  it seems like incomebased payment option is the smartest option,6,
76656,i wish my student loan balance was  1500,6,
76657,i knew this story was light on facts turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies  source   yahoo finance   https  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386html,6,
76658,gt  our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is nt the first and wo nt be the last  this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least,8,
76659,he was nt arrested for not paying his loan  he was arrested for not showing up in court  and the marshals did nt storm his house guns blazing they had guns  with them   like every other cop in the entire country,7,
76660,if you take money and have no plans on paying it back  it s called stealing,9,
76661,right the debt collectors just bought the debt  payed the filing fees to bring the case to court  threatened the man with their now official   pay us or else  and when he did not they used their settlement to have him arrested by the marshals nope  no government officers for hire here  just good old debt collection paid and serviced through the courts,5,
76662,til that most people have no understanding how the court system works  yes  civil attorneys can issue subpoenas  yes  a court can hold you in contempt if you fail to appear yes  a potential punishment for contempt is a bench warrant for your arrest  tl  dr  you can not simply ignore subpoenas you may go to jail,5,
76663,writing and publishing articles like this is dangerous the author offered a sensationalist angle on the  story  while leaving out key elements of why they were there in the first place ie missing court summons this is highly unethical and paints the federal government into a larger narrative that fox has been going for basically  rallying people by emotion not logic,5,
76664,this just in  there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government film at 1,5,
76665,student loans were made with certain assumptions about the future of the economy  both on the part of the schools  the tuition they charge   the lenders  and the student people should be required to pay their student loans but they should be adjusted downward  edit  this guy had a loan for  1500 measly bucks and did nt make any payments in 30 years  i would like to know if he was destitute  or just decided  fuck you everyone  i want to keep my money ,8,
76666,misleading title the marshals service will  arrest  you if you fail to show up for a court appearance you are not being tossed in jail  you are being hauled into court when you refused to answer a summons  from the article   paul aker says he was arrested at his home last week for a  1500 federal student loan he received in 1987  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  does anyone feel sorry for this man   1500  be serious,7,
76667,if i did nt pay back a federal loan for 29 years  i d kind of expect for there to be negative effects this dude did nt pay his loan  including when he was taken to court over it and received a judgment from the court specifically telling him to pay it if you ignore a court order  you re gon na have a bad time  i mean yes  the financial aid system needs to be fixed  but they re going after people who purposely are nt paying their loans which is a surprising amount of people  given how many refund chasers there are in the world for anyone else  there are programs like deferment options  sliding payscales  and whatever else along with loan forgiveness after 20 years  it s a shitty system  but this guy s case is not going to be the one to change it because he does nt deserve to have people dying on his hill for his particular cause,7,
76668,i m socialist and firmly believe that education and medical care should be paid for by federal government out of contributions that we make  however with that said  if you are contributing member of society you have to be a special kind of asshole not to repay  1500 loan over the period of 29 years no matter what was that loan used for,8,
76669,why is this news,3,
76670,dude got letters in his mail for months to pay and appear in court  this doesnt just come out of the blue he refused to show up to court multiple times thats a criminal offense,5,
76671,the revolution will not be subsidize,5,
76672,the whole student loan thing is a complete disaste,6,
76673,talk is cheap  between the intelligence agencies  an the lack of marijuana decriminalizatoinlegalizatoin  obama is nt that idfferent from previous administration,5,
76674,just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to the paper really is nt worth it otherwise college is becoming a joke anyways,5,
76675,every interaction i have ever had with navient  they have done everything they can to work with me  is your payment affordable  would you like a deferment  etc  i have had to take them up on that because of divorce not saying that is everyone s experience but they have nt been the loan sharks everyone else seems to act like they are just one man s experience though,5,
76678,living in germany and studying  i m gon na pay 300   335   for the upcoming semester  these 335  also includes a public transportation ticket  which is in your student id  that allows me to take the train  bus  tram etc at any time as much as i like in my entire state  books are nt nearly as expensive as in the us  the most expensive book i bought last semester was 80   89    but  seriously  95  of the content for the majority of the courses are uploaded on the university s website  files and documents which you can download for free  also  the university canteen offers you decent food for a fair price  normally around 35   in the end my biggest expenses during my semester are the coffees i buy on campu,9,
76679,i m from the uk and have lived in germany for 6 years now i came here with a 20000 gbp student loan for a 4 year degree in computer science  now i m about to start a masters in web science that will cost me about 1000 eur for the 2 year course  parttime and remote  i m also just about to get german citizenship  most germans are happy to speak english  i have a job here and although most of the company speak english they make i point of speaking german with me  and i with them  i m not very good at german but am slowly learning now after 5 years of being very lazy about learning the language it s a very hard language to learn  screw those articles   but in time you ll get used to it  i absolutely love speaking to locals in german and being understood by them  to me it s like being on another planet and finally being accepted by the local populus  good luck to anyone who wants to come over  it is a wise move  come and see me near koblenz,9,
76680,a friends son went to college in switzerland  we are american  even though he paid additional fees as a non native  and had to travel back and forth to europe  he still paid less than kids who went to local colleges,9,
76681,come gather around the fire and listen to a tale of a spooky and simple explanation of our increasing tuition rates in the us  the government started giving student loans kids take the debt  the schools get the money tuition prices increase because they can rely on the kids to get a gov loan take away student loans  then schools ca nt rely on this money  kids ca nt afford the jacked up tuitions  enrollments drop  schools are forced to cut tuition  now more affordable again it s the same problem with mortgage crisis  just a different industry,9,
76682,it s almost as if germany sees the benefit of having a well educated work force that is not bogged down by insurmountable debt,9,
76683,my college actually sodomizes me,9,
76684,whereas here in the states  they will gladly charge you a  250semester parking fee and you will still not actually be guaranteed a space,8,
76685,maybe i should go to germany,9,
76686,currently living in germany  as an american student on an international internship  what this is nt telling you is that the uni system is significantly different my roommates  all in engineering or other sciences  study all day every day they have a month of exams coming up  and they usually have only one exam per year you fail that  you fail no assignments  projects  etc  just that exam  did i mention this was a fraternity  yeah  they do nt go to uni because everyone does it  like america they work  they get accepted  and they work even more it is nt for partying  it is nt for meeting your spouse or friends  it s for becoming the best you can be  which is how a university should be  good luck to the americans coming here thinking it s anything like the states enjoy the d  ner,9,
76687,something like this gets posted everysingleweek without fail and then a bunch of americans start making hasty decisions to just go study in germany because it s  free   oh and it has been this way for years so it is nt a new thing  the german courses that you will have to take for at least a year to reach fluency are around  300 a month and noduolingo is absolutely not enough to get you to the level you need to study at university  the fees for applications are at  75 then an additional 15  for each university you apply to after the first it can go well into the hundreds  the bank account you have to open for your student visa has to have a frozen amount of at least approx   8500 this is nt to say it is impossible but do nt expect roses and rainbows and raining beer amp  wurst to await your easy university life in germany  also american universities except the few ivy leagues or outstanding schools  baby the absolute shit outta you you can pretty much sail smoothly your first two years while you get your core courses out of the way in germany  you jump right into it in german remember  a different language a crazy  difficult language at that the high school diploma is also not equivalent to the german one that allows you to study at a university the equivalent would be a plethora of ap courses with really good grades or a high school diploma plus two years of college with really good grades and then you re equivalent to a german high school graduate  you will also most likely not be able to transfer credits  german bureaucracy  a bitch you will have to have german knowledge when applying for your visas or someone to be a translator there with you  you may have to do a prep year for certain programs as well it is also very competitive to get into even these programs  i sound like fucking scrooge but i ve been through all of it as so have many people i met along the way  it is possible but it will take a lot of hard work and dedication and time that you wo nt regret  losing  because it may not work out perfectly you may get rejected you may not be accepted for that semester a lot of the popular programs have a cap so it s very restricted in terms of amount of students accepted  do nt expect germany to be a country that is just waiting and fiddling its thumbs for the americans to come and study in their unis for  free  and think that they re gon na make it easy for you it is anything but,9,
76688,my american husband started learning german at the age of 26 a year later he was admitted to vet school here he s almost finished now we ve been paying 120 euros a semester i think he s the only foreign student to not drop out in his class though the drop out rate is high even for germans while he s happy he is debt free  the immense stress of having to learn a very hard subject in a foreign language and a foreign system  bureaucracy is insane here   have caused many panic attacks and one major case of depression and he has nt even started the huge final exam yet but at least we wo nt be  200k in debt when this is over,8,
76689,the fee is actually 150500  per semester books inclusive because of librarys and because we live in 2016 and share digitaly public transport also free  you get 600  per month plus health care  if your parents arent rich  this will be checked by government  as student  and will have to pay back   half of that   in worst conditions after you finished  also  after 3 semesters you must have passed 23 of your finals at any time to get your  baf  g  money  but this will only be checked once no money for extra semesters of course,9,
76690,in my opinion let them come here  let them study here and let them stay here if they want besides the fact that the ones who stay make up for the cost of education it is a great way of cultural exchange  it s always nice to have friends from different countries  so if you are coming to the area of n  rnberg just text me ,8,
76691,currently living in duisburg  germany and studying at the university of duisburgessen   my choice   i grew up in the us  but my parents are from germany after graduating high school it became apparent that studying in germany was an opportunity that i could not pass up i chose my current uni because it has an international studies in engineering program which allows me to pursue a bachelors degree in computer engineering with the first year taught entirely in english   costs   the costs are definitively low the semester fee  including public transport  is below 300   my total living expenses are below 700  a month and that includes health insurance   my experience so far   keep in my mind i m still in my first semester  as others have mentioned before  the majority of students quit after the first year last year  the failure rate of an exam taken by 200 students was over 95   attending lectures is completely voluntary and there is one exam at the end of each course that makes up 100  of your final course grade no homework is given and you are very much on your own forcing yourself to focus and learn everyday can be a serious challenge  feel free to comment or pm with any questions,7,
76692,many american students also come with very false expectations about what german university is like you have to be way more self organised and please do nt expect multiple choice tests,9,
76693,we need to stop this immigration because when america sends its people  it sends unskilled people and we have to spend our money on them we are going to build a wall  get america to pay for it and make germany great again,9,
76694,you can only offer something for free if you limit supply fewer germans go to college than us students   only 30  of germans ages 2534 have completed a tertiary education  which includes academic degrees and some but not all vocational programs that  s below the oecd average  and below the us 45  attainment rate for the same age group  http  wwwlatimescomlocaleducationcommunitylameedufreecollegeeducationingermanybutnotincalifornia20151029htmlstoryhtml edit  so now i am amused that many people are suggesting that fewer people should go to college in the us  presumably other people  not so much themselves they are smart   it seems like this would be a less popular proposal than promising free tuition,9,
76697,god  this pisses me off gay marriage has nothing to do with you what two gay people do in the comfort of their own homes is none of your business,6,
76698,being thrown out by supreme court in 321,5,
76699,gt  the state senate rules committee passed a sweeping  religious freedom  bill on tuesday that would allow faithbased nonprofits that receive public funds to discriminate against lgbt people  what a fucking joke tax dollars will literally be spent discriminating against gay people because of this bill jesus  without the civil rights act the south would still be embracing segregation and hiding behind a bastardized interpretation of the first amendment then as well,1,
76700,it s fun that the government has turned the words freedom and patriot in to code words for tyrannical  and selfish,1,
76701,okay  i m not american  but did nt the senate legalise homosexual marriage  so is nt this unconstitutional,1,
76702,allowing people to do what they want with their own property is nt antigay  it s profreedom and proequality the right to follow your on conscience is as fundamental as the right to follow your own gender identity equality under the law is as far as laws should go,1,
76703,can anyone say hillbilly,,
76704,i have 2 problems with this a  fair and equal treatment isnt a right hate to say it  but people are assholes would i refuse to serve someone based on some character trait  no is it still my right to refuse to serve anyone i dont like  assuming that it s my buisiness   you bet your ass it is it s not a smart buisiness plan  but the law doesnt require that i be smart b  how the fuck would someone know that youre gay  i mean  sure some people might fit every single stereotype  but that doesnt mean that they are gay unless they specifically ask  are you gay  and you reply  yes  i am homosexual   which again  is not required by law   how would they be able to destinguish your sexuality  this whole bill is just too messy for my likin,,
76705,man  why do the people who run this state have to be such major assholes,,
76706,as a citizen i propose that when every you meet someone from the state legislature  just turn around and fart at them,,

76709,funny how employers get to steal from employees  and if they are caught  they simply have to repay the employee what they are owed nobody gets charged  nobody goes to jail  meanwhile  if an employee steals from an employer  they get charged  fined  and probably spend some time in jail ditto for customers who steal  i wonder why people hate the government and rich people,8,
76710,hopefully australia has a similar thing to the usa where prisoners are paid like 47 cents per day,6,
76711,not as bad as actual slaves that work in unpaid internships,5,
76712,well  when the tpp goes through we ll all get to enjoy such working conditions  the fact of the matter is that this occurs constantly  the authorities refuse to investigate and the workers lack the leverage to bring the employers to court,1,
76713,here in the us the government would go after ahmed and not see an issue with what was going on monetarily  edit  some of you really need to step away from the computer and not take this place so seriously,,

76718,from the regressive left s perspective  by censoring and silencing opposing opinions  especially those from sources merely  perceived  as not being   progressive   regressive enough  they are allowing for  traditionally oppressed groups  to   be used as a mouthpiece that ca nt be challenged because of cries of racism   speak  just as long as they say the correct    progressive   regressive things ,,

76730, every  prepackaged shredded cheese has it it s the most common anticlumping agent used around the world the argument is that the labels said 100  cheese,9,
76731,labels should be accurate end of story if the product inside does not match the label ingredients  it is fraud and should be prosecuted as such,8,
76732,that s why you buy a little wedge of parm and use a microplane grater on it to shave cheese onto your pasta the wedge lasts a very long time  and in the end it s cheaper than the nasty jars,7,
76733,cellulose is the actual substance you ll find it in all pregrated cheeses these guys were just busted putting too much in to save    lettuce is also made of cellulose where commercial outfits get it for cheese  i guess could be just about any plant judged edible  including  sure  trees  also who knows what kind of cheese you re supposedly getting much nicer to get a hunk of the real stuff and a crank grater  my knuckles hate box graters with a passion ,8,
76734,so my penne has wood,7,
76735,so the correct labeling is 92  cheese and 8  wood filler  i think that s right,6,
76736,solution  buy your parmesan  domestic or real  and grate it yourself tastes better too if you re really lazy  grate it and freeze until you need it,7,
76737,damn were becoming like china  next will have faked food,6,
76738,what kind of wood   are we talking the high quality organic stuff  or factory processed scrap wood  because goddamnit if they ve been slipping cheap wood shavings into my welfarecheese  we re going to have an fucking issue on our hands,4,
76739,lol  wood it is cellulose trying to get clicks,6,
76740,i m safe  source  only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti,3,
76741,i shred my own parmesan cheese  it makes worlds differenc,3,
76742,this is why i do nt buy nasty sargento cheese ever taste it  it tastes like wood  i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better,3,
76743,hmm i am pretty sure i misread that title,1,
76744,it s cheaper by the chunk anyways,1,
76745,similar to olive oil  most parmesan cheese is nt even parmesan cheese,1,
76746,my parents always called it cardboard chees,1,
76747,it still taste oh so goooooooood,1,
76748,if it tastes good  i do nt care,1,
76749,pene means weiner in spanish that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood,1,
76750,maybe they are just trying to get people to eat a whole door over the course of a year,1,
76751,just buy the blockwedge and grate your own,1,
76752,gt  she faces up to a year in prison  so  what re you in for blondie    just beat me up and get it over with,1,
76753,cellulose is indeed an anti clumping agent if they use more and it does not change taste  i am ok with it at least it has less calories  ,,
76754,if you buy preshredded or grated cheese  you deserve to eat wood,,
76756,i have my own super secret private social network site that only i know about,6,
76757,so  i read the article and it appears the site was not created by anonymous but anonymous advocates the site  i believe facebook could use some healthy competition  though i question how private anyone s information can be on the internet  even with encryption it seems no matter how much you try to protect someone s information online  there is always someone who  with enough time and ingenuity  can obtain it,5,
76758,anyone else get the feeling this was an ad,4,
76759, doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  i have watched criminal minds penelope can do it,6,
76760,given the propensity of anonymous for leaking confidential and private information of people who do nt share their viewpoints  i do nt know how super private it would stay if someone expressed a contrary opinion would my belief that kanye is an immature narcissist result in release of the name and location of my virginity loss  or my 2nd grade teacher  btw  not the same person ,6,
76761,i bet tom from facebook is already a membe,3,
76762,gt  but unlike its competitors it doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  so how does it make money to pay for development  management  support  bandwidth  and servers  i do nt know how this shit gets reported slow news day  remember that stupid  social network  diaspora  they got global coverage about their facebook alternative i do nt think they ever even finished the product  let alone had anyone use it  must be built by the son of some important news editor who can drum up publicity this is likely the same,3,
76763,so if i log into reddit on the tor network and my verification email account  if i were to use one  was anonymous  would nt that be the same thing,3,
76764,facebook s shills are working overtime in this posts comments i hope this social media site becomes a viable alternative,3,
76765,private social media pick one,1,
76766,i love when people treat shit like this like news downvote it to where it belongs,,
76767,eh  with anonymous s history of doxxing people  i rather not use anything that they have a hand i,,
76768,so some social dropout  400 lb teenage hackers are going to be watching over other the private data of other people  i do nt think the anonymous group realizes how much they are despised across the internet,,
76769,i would trust this site over facebook,,
76771,the majority of colorado is not going to be happy about this,3,

76778,well shit i just read a til like last week about him still being alive,1,
76779,his fatal mistake was using that old refrigerator to play hide and seek,1,
76781,this makes sense a lot of people in science fields relating to cancer formation  such as radiology and medicinal biology  are of the opinion that most cancerous tumors are actually quietly killed by the body before they can reach critical mass to defend themselves  and the ones that prove dangerous are the ones that either do nt register to t cells or which grow too quickly to be snuffed to simplify  the reasons for this are simple  not everyone dies from cancer  and everyone gets exposed to carcinogens given the rate of mutation  the influence of radiation  the amount of background radiation  etc  that everyone is unavoidably exposed to  we should all develop tumors if there is a true casual relationship if you simply say that the body is helpless against them naturally  we would all die from cancer the body  must  be defending itself from them given that we do nt  in fact  it s basically accepted as scientific truth cancer is nt simply the presence of cancerous tumors  it s the presence of cancerous tumors that have the right surrounding cells  in the right quantity  that do nt die from immune system intervention and which have favorable growth conditions most small tumors simply do nt have the right conditions  and die studies have confirmed that the ones that register as cancer are a subset of all tumors that might form  because this subset avoids the usual limiting factors  so  going back to the article  this is simply taking the bodies natural process for fighting tumors and guiding it to specific cancers it might normally miss and saying  go get it   then praying you did nt just kill the poor sap with his now manically overenthusiastic immune system,6,
76782,gt  the treatment involves removing the tcells from patients  tagging them with  receptor  molecules that target cancer  and putting them back into the body in an infusionthe targeting molecules  known as chimeric antigen receptors or cars  came from specially bred genetically engineered mice   gt  in one study  94 percent of participants suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia  all  said their symptoms vanished completely after they were treated with the modified blood cells  known as tcells  it looks like this could be a very  very big deal i m surprised that  as of this comment  this post is not getting much attention,7,
76783,now they just need to find a way to reverse liver cirrhosis and i can live forever,1,
76784,this is a breakthrough right up until the pharmaceutical companies buy the process and tuck it away forever  there s no money to be made in curing a disease,1,
76785,i m rather hopeful that we ll be able to cure most cancers within the next 20 years or so  and hopefully before that we ll have something that wo nt cure it but will reliably halt cancer so that a patient can just wait for the actual cure to be found  as with we do with hiv i believe  maybe i m being too optimistic  but you got ta be optimistic about something in this miserable world,1,
76788,gt  barbins has been charged with  displaying obscene matter to a minor  and child pornography  police say  sounds like a molestation charge is soon to follo,3,

76799,is that typical for a first time offense in florida,8,
76800,12 months of probation plus losing your license is pretty standard,6,
76801,i mean  many states and counties do nt do mandatory jail time for first time duis,8,
76802,heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off fre,8,
76803,her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui,8,

76814,driving drunk is not easy,1,
76815,what is 10 day weekend work release,1,
76816,at first i thought this was a reasonable charge  but when i read the article it said that she was actually driving with a flat tire most drunks are smart enough to avoid driving on a flat  this woman is an idiot and deserves a harsh punishment she was intoxicated enough to seriously endanger the lives of others  if an officer had nt pulled her over i m sure she would have caused some serious damage,,
76817,that s cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work releas,,
76818,well it s not like you can prove that she was actually intoxicated  so the fact that she was nt punished seems appropriate,,

76866,sounds a lot like hitech money laundering to m,1,
76868,i lived 200yds from a burn pit when i was there in 04 i had some skin disease for about 2 years after iraq and some kind of asthma the va did nt give a shit then and they still do nt care  so  i got that goin for me,9,
76869,i was in tikrit  cob speicher  from 08 to 09 i lived a few hundred feet from the  burn pit  it was basically a huge junk yard with 3 huge constantly burning rectangular pits they were about 75 feet long and 50 feet across iirc you could see black or white smoke billowing from the area all the time i had to go there at least once a week to dump trash imagine standing over a red hot fire throwing junk off the back of a flatbed truck while it was 130 degrees outside sometimes the smog was so thick driving through the junk yard  that you could nt see 50 feet in front of you the smoke would almost always linger around the base and it smelled awful olfactory fatigue did not apply here it always smelled no matter how long you d be  exposed  you never got used to it never mind that they burned our shit right next door i remember one day we had to do a pt test the 2 mile run was on the same road as the burn pit smoke everywhere nobody passed that day some people were puking at the end i usually ran a 13  45 2 mile and i remember getting over 17 minutes i was gasping for air at the end we all thought the course was marked out incorrectly  but when we measured it later that day it was exactly 2 miles needless to say  nobody ever had any respiratory protection around these things  ever nor were we ever told we needed them i mean we had our gas masks in our gear  but nobody wanted to be  that guy  damn  we used to joke about it all the time whenever someone would start spewing some  war story   or when some freshoutabasic private would try to tell us about  that one time my drill sergeant made us do this  story   at the end we d say   yeah  but have you ever been to the burn pit    then we d laugh it off i guess it s not so funny anymore,8,
76870,my husband  half  jokes about the cancer he s going to get from the burn pits in afghanistan from what he described  they were horrible,7,
76871,this hits close to home we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight i really need to get this checked out,7,
76872,i can understand why burning trash and human waste may be unavoidable in certain military circumstances like in those remote outposts in afghanistan that might house 1520 people  there really are nt any good alternatives  however it seems less defensible to not have invested in better infrastructure once you had permanent bases the size of small cities  once you re at the point where soldiers had their own little airconditioned houses made out of cargo containers with air conditioning  satellite television  and onbase burger king it seems like you can probably invest in some proper trash incinerators instead of open burn pits,7,
76873,gt  though the us government disputes it well  color me surprised,8,
76874,a tsgt i know died recently from cancer he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family he was 32 his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer,7,
76875, support our troops with a ribbon sticker   that will definitely make up for all the fucked up shit the government puts them through,7,
76876,not surprised saw a guy in the va who used to jog through the base with his unitteam  not sure of the terminology   breathing in the smoke from one of these every day for 4 years he had some chronic lung condition we were working up  and said a couple of his buddies also have lung problems now otherwise perfectly healthy 40 years old  completely unnecessary illness due to stupidity andor apathy,6,
76877,http  wwwpublichealthvagovexposurescamplejeune for decades  the government knowingly allowed service members and their dependents to consume contaminated tap water fifteen diseases are recognized to have a direct relation to the contamination but many more are cropping up yet the government wo nt recognize those  yet   and they re filing motions to have claims tossed out based on statute of limitations  even though the government did nt even announce the contamination until over a decade after the wells were closed  this is nt just an agent orange or iraq war contamination where soldiers were exposed and have problems babies born at the base hospital hadhave an alarmingly high rate of birth defects but nothing is being done about it and the va continues to deny claims we ll just go ahead and add this one to the list,6,
76878,uhh i ve had a severe cough for 34 years now  since coming back from afghanistan  it ll get so bad  that i ll cough until i throw up  and then cough more  the va said it was normal i m sure they know what they re talking about i feel fine,6,
76879,i remember having to sit through a 2 hour briefing the first week i arrived in iraq  back in 2008 we were told that scientists verified that the burn pit on base was not a detriment to our health  then we had to sign forms when i returned stateside  there were quite a few reports of people having respiratory issues after returning from deployment  the va also denied that any illnesses were related to desert storm it took a long time for anyone other than veterans to admit that desert storm syndrome was a real thing  and then said veterans had to go through the gauntlet of proving their illnesses were related to their deployment,7,
76880,goddamn  it s unbelievable the way vets are treated shame,6,
76881,government does nt give a fuck about veterans,5,
76882,my 36yo buddy was just diagnosed with nonhodgkens lymphoma when he visited the va to do the paperwork they asked what bases he served at overseas  and literally had a list of diseases to reference per base just got a  yep  here it is probably from the burn pit  from the clerk thumbing down the list when he told me i was blown away  why is nt there any followup with soldiers who served at these bases    even a simple  you may want to get screened  when he returned from service would have given us some hope of getting in front of it it s incredibly irritating,5,
76883,the us lying about iraq and afghanistan  nah  never happen,7,
76884,do nt worry guys we ll take care of your medical needs when you come home oh wait,5,
76885,do nt forget area 51 they had burn pits like you would nt believe stealth materiels that had top secret components in them the poor guys that were exposed to all of this could nt even go for help  many died in secrecy  i know i was exposed to vaporized depleted uranium and who knows what else i have a sort of bet with my self that i ll die an early death,5,
76886,so  the dod did nt learn any lessons from previous burn pits  i mean  when you have to declassify area 51 because of workers health decline due to burn pits  you d think you d remember this shit is wrong,5,
76887, though he returned home safely in september 2009  he woke up one day a few months later with an inexplicable headache  numbness in his limbs and paralysis on one side of his body beau had suffered a mild stroke his health deteriorated  and he was diagnosed with brain cancer less than two years later  he died at the age of 46  holy fuck    fuck wars and politicians that start them,4,

76892,holy shit  my friend who was on the poop burning detail a bunch of times died of throat cancer earlier this year my first thought was it was the poop burning that did it  and i m concerned as well because i did my fair share of that as well,4,
76893,where we lived there was a burn pit that was nearby and the smoke would always float over to where we were  as of yet i dont have any symptoms but i do have a begine growth in my head  i have had it checked but i am paranoid that it could become bad ,4,
76894,little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did nt have to bother to actually lob chemicalbio weapons at us we d send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chembio bomb themselves  did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney,4,

76921,apollo  which owns protection 1 parent prime security services borrower llc will pay  42 per share of adt  a premium of nearly 56  over adt s closing share price friday of  2687  gt  tyco international  which purchased adt in 1997  spun off adt as a independent publiclytraded company in 2012,1,
76923,gt   the order is vague and because it imposes disproportionate  intrusive  and punitive measures against households and businesses with   no due process     did nt see that one coming,9,
76924,isps do nt actually want to spy on their customers like that it costs more money to put systems in place to do so and to maintain and operate those systems on top of that  it will only bring them bad press that could piss off customers  cox is basically saying  fuck you i m not taking a significant financial hit to spy on our customers so you can sue them and make money for yourself  they are doing the right thing  and the right thing also happens to be in their best business interest,9,
76925,good guy cox  not selling out their customers  they actually have super reliable internet no outages in any of my apartments so far,9,
76926,so to sum that up we do nt have to worry about any cox blocking,9,
76927,that s nice  but i m still going to run a vpn,8,
76928,all in all i ve been pretty happy with cox as an isp i ve used them in two different cities and it s always been reliable and fast i pay for 300mbps service and always get those speeds  usually higher almost no outages they re putting in 1gbs service in many of their cities right now  including mine  my biggest gripe with them is they have a soft data cap of 2 tb for my tier they do not enforce the caps at all but the fact that they exist means they are probably toying with the idea and there would be nothing to stop them from going evil since they are a monopoly like every other major isp it s like a benevolent dictatorship  http  wwwspeedtestnetmyresult5089441276 that s with a netflix stream going on in another room right now,9,
76929,this must be a new thing many a year s ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did nt even know what that was  none of us knew what that even was and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi,7,
76930,i ve been really happy with cox for an isp both personally and professionally here in okc personally  out of nowhere they bumped my at home connection from 15mbit to 100mbit and my bill  went down  30  all out of nowhere  without me saying a word internet is always up  not throttled  and they have decent support if it s needed  professionally at my job i ran in ip phone deployment with them for our main office  3 satellite offices they were there 100  of the way i have personal names and numbers to call in the event of issues outside of the scope of my support as the companies it admin  and when we ve needed someone on site to climb a pole for instance their longest response time was 45 minutes  i know this sounds like rhailcorporate but the fact is out of all the isps i ve had  comcast  qwest  charter  etc  they ve been the best that s not saying they should nt and could nt be better  but they re angels next to the others  in fact they proactively contact me at work every once and awhile to check on things which i greatly appreciate and they bring us cookies every month yes  our isp brings yes cookies no  we re not a big company 9 employees they re just nice,8,
76931,basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum,8,
76932,i used to work for cox in the field and inside cox did have a department that would monitor massive down loading and uploading but they did away with it shortly after i got there  within a year cox ca nt afford to lose customers right now so it s no surprise they are nt allowing this if they did then they would go out of business from customer loss i survived their huge layoff and realignment,5,
76933,this is nothing new from cox i have had cox internet for over 10 years and worked for them a few years ago they have always had this attitude toward it s customers the customer pays for internet access  cox provides internet access they do nt even enforce data caps  at least in oklahoma   i have received a few emails due to using so much data suggesting that i switch to a business plan to maximize my speed  but have never been charged extra or cut off due to exceeding a data cap,7,
76934,gt  last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers  what the actual fucking fuck,6,
76935,as a customer this is the first good thing i ve ever heard from cox,4,
76936,not true from my experience,3,
76937,i ve had them as an isp for several years and they re excellent i did have one month where i went over my allowed bandwidth limit  300 gb on a 50 mbps down plan   and all i got was an email saying  do nt do that again   no throttling or charges or anything on 100 mbps down plan right now and i usually get 110 at least they re great  come out to me if i m having internet trouble that s not solved by online support  etc pretty good basically  i love cox and i m very satisfied with how much i get,3,
76938,unrelated but i could nt stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox,3,
76939,i am a proud supporter of cox,3,
76940,where are all the penis jokes,3,
76941,not as nice as it sounds if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do nt catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status  eg that they do nt have any liabilityresponsibility for what people use their pipe for   most carriers are  very  vested in not being the internet police,3,
76942,i m guessing that if they had a way to monetize it and add to the bottom line  they d be very supportive,3,
76943,when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battl,5,
76944,cox is actually a familyowned business one of the major interest holders is a 96 year old woman who inherited from her father  she had been running it with her sister until her death in 2007   i happen to think they re one of the leastshady isp and cable providers out there  they also own the travel channel  which is a pretty great channel,5,
76945,i thought this was talking about jesse cox,4,
76946,i work for cox corporate in a startup tech company  and this makes me so happy  btw  they re just as decent an employer as they are an isp compan,3,
76947,cox is spying like a champ  rest assured you have to be quite innocent or high on meth to think they have nt supplied info to big brother and his little brothers  and will not in the future,3,
76948,yells loudly  i will not    whispers  if you need me too,1,
76949,on that headline alone  i thought jessie cox was asked to spy on his youtube subs  was very confused for a little bit,1,
76950,i knew he was my favorite eagl,1,
76951,well that s one bit of good news from cox now if they d stop raising my rates every few months,1,
76952,damn  i wish i had cox i have time warner and i m on my 3rd notice to stop torrenting i do nt know if they ll actually pull the plug  they re charging me out the ass already since they re the only provider in my area,1,
76953,fuck yea cox   comcast   1  co,1,
76954,cox  and to some extent time warner  are cable companies all cable companies fuck you in the ass  these two have the decency to spit on it first i at the very least get what i pay for with both of them,1,
76955,they sent me a few emails in the past  so i got a vpn i will still use it  but good on cox for not being dickbags,1,
76956,they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jone,1,
76957,i had cox for 3 years service was good  and over that 3 years  doubled my download speeds twice no extra cost upload was still garbage  but hey 10015 internet for  65 a month was still pretty killer i have 7575 fios now,1,
76958,almost every single person in my area that has gone to atamp  t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable  they have some shit with them but it s far less shit than others,1,
76959,they re my isp and even though they re the only isp in my city besides att and verizon  they ve been awesome,1,
76960,the shifting of blame to continue  going after johns and endusers has never worked,1,
76961,ho yeah  today is a good day to have cox  teehee,1,
76962,horseshit they cut off our internet because someone was downloading something like a year ago they re the best isp i ve ever used  but they absolutely do exactly what the mpaa et al want,1,
76963,between cox and cable one in both places i live  i actually like our midwest internet providers i feel bad for people getting rammed by twc and comcast we ve paid  45 for 100mbps for several years  which sounds way better than the horror stories i hear from you guys,1,
76964,cause they love internet freedom  or because it costs an extra 30 cents to have an extra indian screen data at the call center for 70 an hour,1,
76965,protected pirate plan from cox   7500month,1,
76968,they need stricter gun control,1,
76970,this is why a lot of former cops are setting up companies where they transport the cash for it it s also a huge motivation for the stores to keep 2 separate sets of books  a real one and one the irs gets to see,9,
76971,this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day,9,
76972,gt  one of the three men who escaped from a california jail last month had been charged with kidnapping a marijuana dispensary owner that they suspected had hidden large amounts of cash in the desert the man and his accomplices are accused of driving the dispensary owner out to the desert  torturing him and cutting off his penis  sheesh i m not carrying more than  10 in my wallet from now on  and that has nothing to do with the fact that i m broke,9,
76973,this is why they get robbed all the time out here no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys,7,
76974,ca nt these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us,8,
76975,there s a great documentary on netflix called  high profits  about a business in breckenridge  co right before full legalization took effect  one of the big issues was exactly this only being able to do business in cash from payroll to paying city taxes they had  120k in cash they had to just walk into the front of the city building with and that was just the first month alone  some of the people that make the drops to the shops are walking out with  10k in their pockets and no security at all it s terrifying,8,
76976,civil forfeiture time,6,
76977,ironically  it s also just flat out illegal to own large sums of money anything over a few hundred bucks  and the government can sieze that money  because the money committed the crime of intent to purchase narcotics,9,
76978,time to start using gold,6,
76979,so the tax man will gladly take cannadollars  but the banks will not this is ridiculously stupid,6,
76980,same deal in washington still have to buy my shit with cash oh but i can buy cigs and alcohol with a card no problem  if you want to pick up a gram here or there it s no problem  but i buy in bulk  since it s cheaper that means i need to stop by the bank to get  140 that s the only time i carry that much money on me  it s like requiring a personal check to get a passport no cashier s check  no card wtf it s 2016,8,
76981,are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money,4,
76982,this war on cash is such bullshit  people carried cash until 12 years ago and it was perfectly fine  now they are trying to restrict flying with cash  purchasing with cash  seizing cash   the only problem is that the money is due on one day  they need to have the tax office take payment on any day of the week  so it s stacked,6,
76983,i wonder how negative interest rates  if implemented  would effect the marijuana business these value of the business would probably increase as they had large sums of cash on hand their credit worthiness would increase because they had something of value  cash  but they would be penalized for depositing that cash according to the recent imf working paper i wonder if they would become attractive targets for some banks to help capitalize their weak balance sheets,3,
76984,oh well let you do business  but you just wo nt be able to use any banks what a backwards ass countr,3,
76985,this is a perfect storm for evil doers who seize this unfortunate opportunity all they would have to to do is steak out a caregiver facility i would hope something changes soon this is absurd and the last word of that article  like my post  is penis,3,
76986,they should accept bitcoin problem solved,3,
76987,and you just made it worse by telling people thi,6,
76988,meanwhile   larry summers  it s time to kill the  100 bill   http  wwwbusinessinsidercomsummerstimetokillthe100bill20162  the banking system is corrupt anyhow its time to flush this turd system for something better,5,
76989,sell gift cards  buy them with debitcredit then use the gift card,5,
76990,so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash,3,
76991,bitcoin is the answe,4,
76992,time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins,4,
76993,that  s because it  s cash day at the collection center  when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill  and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot,4,
76994,pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california,1,
76995,its a shame they cant count on the highwayrobber police to guard the money,1,
76996,it looks like they re tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books,1,
76997,this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is,1,
76998,someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy,1,
76999,what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit  checks for those transactions  then just but the trees with the gift certificate,1,
77000,as if the banks do nt take drug money as we speak it is also not like the fbi do nt have cases on going against those banks i really do nt see why there is a problem,1,
77001,can they not employ armored trucks,1,
77002,it s the same way in washington and colorado it s still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed,1,
77003,since the money cant be deposited into a bank would a good option to take be converting it into precious metals such as gold  you would still need to store the gold but that could be easily done in a safety deposit however unless you know where to go  getting that much gold could raise the attention of people you dont want raised to begin with it s not like in china or india  if you show up with a briefcase of cash and walk out with a smaller case of gold  no one really cares,1,
77004,can they print their tax forms using hemp paper  and then turn them into the irs,1,
77005,watch out for that   cop robbery   civil asset forfeiture,1,
77006,so  did anyone else read that article right to the end  the last sentence oof,1,
77007,it would be interesting for all of the companies to announce they were bringing their taxes to the tax office on a particular day let it be known to all criminals in the state i wonder if the state might decide to put some security on the place  then,1,
77008,build your own secure fort no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building,1,
77011,yes please too big to fail means they are too big  period break them apart,8,
77012,this seems like a no brainer not saying it will be easy  but why ever have banks too large to fail even exist,9,
77013,absolutely agree  but it will likely go nowhere it really is nt any different than when the government stepped in and broke up atamp  t into the baby bells unfortunately  this is talk by those who have no power to enforce change,6,
77014,big banks and wall street bank elections for both parties not going to happen unless supreme court reverses  citizens united  ruling allowing corporations to donate unlimited amount of funds to politicians and political parties as long as such bribery is legal  no politician will bite the hand that feeds himher,4,
77015,this is a political talking point floated to make sanders look like an over reactor if andor when he loses the nomination this guy and his idea will disappear from sight,5,
77016,hopefully  his floating that idea wo nt end up with him floating in the river,4,
77017,kashkari  eh  so  how does goldman sachs make money off of this,4,
77018,eh  wake me when they actually start breaking them up for now this is just more idle talk,4,
77019,i guess they could nt find a picture that makes him look crazier,4,
77020,if there are any economists here  i have a question how do we know that this wo nt have the same results as breaking up telecoms  regional monopolies collude until one is more successful and one starts to fail the successful one buys the failing one then this process repeats until the most successful one is enormous again  but with writeoffs  layoffs and debts thanks to the less successful ones consumers get screwed by footing the bill for the whole failed experiment  if telecoms can do that  why would we assume that banks wo nt just do the same thing  to the effect of even more pain for consumers,4,
77021,oh hey  it s the guy who ran for california governor,3,
77022,news update  spontaneous fires erupt in rome,3,
77023,no if we break up banks or make them have more capital  they will invest less  and folks on reddit will say its too hard to get a loan the banks will now actually want to make sure folks can actually pay back the loan  and a lot of folks have no assets  and will cry its not fair   only the rich are getting the loans    since they already have assets   are you sure you want to hold banks accountable  personally  i think its a great idea  but not sure you all realize the banks will just push that accountability back on you,3,
77024,that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money,1,
77025,probably not that big of a problem anymore they ve plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 20 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become,1,
77026,looks as though he s beginning a political career as a goldman  fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him asshole,1,
77027,breaking up huge banks reduces the chance that banks will get the giant bailouts the did after 2008 failures  massive corporate welfare they will lobby hard against the potential loss of a free ride,1,
77028,godless commie socialism yes pleas,1,
77029, flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca nt fail  did anyone else see this   wtf  so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further,1,
77030,trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it,1,
77031,from my armchair  i d say that the entire banking sector needs to be deleveraged 301 leverage  or whatever it currently is  is too much slowly  over time  to prevent shocks from the deleveraging   deleverage the banks  and it would make it harder for a crisis to become systemic,1,
77032,kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying,1,
77033,kashkari was part of the paulson team that leveraged the american banking empire into toobigtofail and now that that leverage is proving to be dangerous for the survival of the one per cent kleptocrats he wants to break up the tbtf banks  geithner knew this would manifest when he used tbtf as a stopgap measure to save the synagogue of satan worshiping kleptocracy of fraudsters that run the federal reserve now that same kleptocracy wants to be bailed out once again because geithner s temporary solution has run it s course straight into the gutter where geithner amp  kashkari et al  belong  up yours  america the functional retard,,
77035,at least the guy was honest,4,
77036,i would nt be mad if it was my wallet,1,
77037,how do they know the guy was homeless,1,
77039,the county commissioner who spearheaded the public sales tax for the bengals and reds stadia now works for the bengals,9,
77040,let the  14 dollar beer flow,8,
77041,corruption of public officials in michigan  no way,9,
77042,i certainly do nt necessarily agree with public funds being used for a sports stadium  and i definitely do nt agree with nepotism  but i think criticizing mike illitch somehow taking advantage of detroit is a shortsighted mistake had it not been for mr illitch pretty much singlehandily reinvesting in a city everyone wanted to leave behind over the last 20 years  the city would nt even be close to back on a path to relevancy  whether you want to believe it is or not   the other thing to consider is that this new complex not only brings commerce to an area that was a combination of blight and open fields  it also brings quite a few jobs to the city  as well as some stateoftheart buildings that will bring commerce and international travelers to the area for a variety of reasons  conferences  concerts  etc   this all equals more money for the city of detroit  which is why they re willing to make the investment in the first place   and another part of a blightfilled neighborhood updated and usable for the future  this is a sticky situation that reeks of an unfortunate quidproquo  but when it comes to what is good for the city of detroit  it s hard to argue that anyone has anything on the passion and dedication of mike illitch,9,
77043,how in the fuck are there no comments about the red wings owner s hair  ,9,
77044,everyone talks about the insanity in pro sports these days  yet no one mentions  public or private  universities  which are all nonprofit  spending massive amounts of their cash on stadiums  athletic facilities  etc it s the same thing if the universities are public  and its only marginally different if they re private the reason they have that money in the first place is federallysubsidized student loans,8,
77045,lol illitch has done more for the city of detroit than any other person in the last 50 years fuck off,9,
77046,so he did a good job for the team and the owner offered him more money for a better job  happens all the time  kids,6,
77047,is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit  or ford field  most people would not step foot downtown if it was nt for those two places i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do nt bring forth revitalization like intendedbut the only article i ve read was about stadiums in la and sf,6,
77048,before you jump on the  why ca nt detroit use the money for things that actually matter  train   here s   http  wwwcrainsdetroitcomarticle20140921news309219990oncostfinancingofwingsarenahereareanswers  an article outlining the finances of this massive project  edit  s  for those not wanting to click  gt  the initial base price is  450 million problems  changes and added amenities could increase that final cost anything beyond  450 million must be paid by the ilitches  gt  the michigan strategic fund will sell  450 million in two series of bonds they will be divided into  250 million in series a bonds that will be backed by property taxes already captured by the downtown development authority the  200 million in series b bonds will be backed by the  115 million olympia development has agreed to pay the dda for bond retirement  gt  the ilitches  through olympia  will pay  200 million of the bond debt detroit s dda  via its property tax capture ability  will pay back  250 million of the bonds new yorkbased merrill lynch  a division of bank of america  which has pledged to buy all the publicly backed series a bonds in the deal it will then sell the bonds to the public dallasbased comerica bank inc will buy the series b bonds backed by olympia s money the bank  formerly based in detroit  has the naming rights to comerica park  where the ilitchowned detroit tigers play comerica intends to keep the bonds on its books rather then sell them,8,
77049, misleading title   https  wwwredditcomrhockeycomments45xs0mdetroit_contractor_who_negotiated_285_million_ind00vnke   it was state money  not detroit s also  ilitch footed most of the bill himself  or through his company   please research  the district  and see their plans for it before passing judgement,9,
77050,clickbait no one around here is remotely upset about taxpayer funds going to a new stadium for the most popular team in town we re not really unhappy about the new development for business and residences that is happening and we re not raising any concerns about the effort to revitalize the city  detroit is climbing out of a hole created by the corruption of influential individuals local business and leaders have been more beneficial in this process than any other group and this stadium  and the district surrounding it are seen as victories in this effort,8,
77051,ah  a local spin on the old  congressperson becomes lobbyist  setup,5,
77052,they are literally building new district for the city not just an arena  a whole new district development is what the city needs and frankly  detroit politics have always been just a  wee  bit corrup,4,
77053,but  guys  come on we need our circuses  what would we do with out national sports  concentrate on real issues  lol  that s no fun ,4,
77054,at ohio state  the man whole negotiated the deal to sell its parking rights to a private company  campusparc  left to work for them after it was signed,4,
77055,you think that s a wig,4,
77056,public money should never be allowed to pay for sports teams unless the team has to pay back the city directly  with interest none of this but businesses will benefit  bullsht it s my fucking money you re stealing  i do nt want to  potentially  subsidize businesses downtown,8,
77057,if you re a bernie supporter  who thinks a public funded  1 trillion dollar infrastructure package is a good deal because jobs  but is outraged by the state of michigan investing  285 million in the renovationrevitalization of its  largest city  then you might want to reexamine one of those positions,6,
77058,for all the people complaining about spending the money on the new stadium and  less mentioned  surrounding developments  all i can say is it will be more than worth it if it fixes up that area governments of all levels have been dumping money into the cass corridor since the early days of johnson s great society programs with any luck this will finally be a solution that stick,7,
77059,itt  out of staters have no fucking idea about the current state of economics in detroit and how great this project is going to be for the city  i do nt even know where to begin with this article it s clear the author did nt talk to a single person in the city or state or even try to get a feel for the public opinion on the topic including garbage clickbait phrases like the previous article titled  detroit scam city  how the red wings took hockeytown for all it had  has to be one of the dumbest fucking things i ve ever read  when detroit was at its absolute rock bottom worst  going to joe louis arena was probably the only reason suburban white people would ever go into the city and spend money now mike ilitch wants to build a gigantic urban development project including restaurants  shopping stores    apartment complexes   and oh yeah a brand new stateoftheart arena for one of the most successful hockey teams of all time  they have nt missed the playoffs since before i was born  25 years ago they are a big deal and have been for decades   oh  and it s being built at the exact time there s an influx of young people and new businesses into the the city which will create more upward momentum  yes  the city is helping pay for it the city also got a lot of input on it design  layout  and what additional projects would be built along with the arena this happens in every single city an arenastadium is built i do nt necessarily think that s how it should work but the fact of the matter is that this is how these deals are made and the city absolutely needs projects like this if it wants to continue on its upward trend  also attacks on mike ilitch in this article and this thread are disgusting illitch has been a controversial figure for a long time but his story is like example of the american dream you d see in fiction his parents were poor immigrants  he grew up in detroit joined the marines played minor league baseball for the team he now owns opens up a mom and pop pizza place and creates an empire out of it  gets rich while creating jobs and doing public works projects for the city he grew up in even though it s a complete shit hole mike ilitch has been spending  and yes  making  money in detroit for years mike ilitch was there in the 90 s and early 00 s before there was ever a housing crash in the rest of the country the man is nt a saint but if it were nt for him there would be a lot less charities and projects being invested in now he wants to build a project the city desperately needs with the city s help and input  and he s getting shit on by some dumb ass  journalist  that ca nt get their facts straight  endran,7,
77060,someone call charlie leduff,5,
77061,good old cronyism at its finest  nothing new to detroit at all,5,
77062,i wonder if journalists really think this is breaking news,3,
77063,where is my surprise face,3,
77064,a city official operating at a congressional level,3,
77065,gt  detroit contractor who negotiated  285 million in public money for the red wings now works with red wings owner so  i love how these headlines are supposed to make us feel outraged,4,
77066,same shit happened here in richardson  texas  a suburb of dallas   the mayor brought in a huge company to the city and then left office to get a job with that same company it also turns out she was having an affair with a guy from that company too,3,
77067,stop giving public money let business deal with business  not government  which can only be scammed and lead to corruption and bloated monopolies promote free market  and separation of power,3,
77068,to be fair  he was working with him then too,1,
77069,i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him,1,
77070,conflict of interests everywhere,1,
77071,this is how it worksthere is nt anything new to this story that is nt happening in nearly every major city and state across the country  i do nt like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it,1,
77072,public money  om,1,
77073,wow  you mean so someone who worked very closely with an organization and built relationships decided to work for said company later on in their career  shocking  i tell you,1,
77074,everyone from the owners to the safety and comfort of the city and everyone thinks this whole plan is going to a country that did not mainly speak my language  i would learn it,1,
77075,what a shocking surprise,1,
77076,well that s convenien,1,
77077,in other news  bears do  it turns out  shit in the woods,1,
77078,can we just start an embarrass the fuck out of these greedy punks campaign,1,
77081,while the koches paid the mob in nevada to outlaw anything similar there or so i hypothesize,1,
77083,bison burgers bison steaks bison roasts  yum,8,
77084,the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison,5,
77085,are they only being killed for food  that s slaughter  if they are being killed for management purposes  that s called culling,7,
77086,it s population control  hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use,6,
77087,cancan i help,4,
77088,npr text article and radio discussion if anyone is interested  http  mtprorgpostofficialsagreecullmany900yellowstonebison  stream,1,
77089,so are these bison the ones from the original wild flock that were decimated to almost zero  i heard there is two breeds the original and a commercial domesticated one,1,
77091,idiot drinks and drives and shares it with people over some app idiot gets arrested for drinking and driving it is the idiots first time offense and the idiot gets sentenced to standard punishment for a first time offense nothing to see here,9,
77092,is that typical for a first time offense in florida,8,
77093,12 months of probation plus losing your license is pretty standard,6,
77094,i mean  many states and counties do nt do mandatory jail time for first time duis,8,
77095,heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off fre,8,
77096,her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui,8,
77097,most people do nt go to jail for first time dui the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though,5,
77098,10 day vehicle impound  that is just a rich vs poor sorter  the poor people cant pay for ten days of impound at  80night right away  so every day they wait to pay its another  80 then they lose their car,6,
77099,calls for help  cries for attention  are getting pretty extreme these days  next i m expecting someone to periscope a skydiving jump   i m not going to pull the chute unless i get 100 facebook likes ,3,
77100,reddit   there are too many people in prison     person is treated with leniency   reddit   kill her   look  the point of prison is to rehabilitate  keep society safe  or punish maybe this lady was given a hefty amount of probation  something i often ask for because you always have time to throw someone away and put them in prison  but they do nt get that time back  so they ll lose their jobs  houses  children  etc how exactly does society benefit from that   maybe she has a lot of factors that call for mitigation,5,
77101,it was nt flordia man it was flordia woman,6,
77102,as a 40 year old  are the younger people with smart phones really this fucking stupid  i have a smart phone  and the last freaking thing i do is broadcast every life choice i make what ever happened to  if no one knows  i wo nt get caught  i can remember going to parties in the early 2000 s when digital cameras were getting popular and i would shy away from them while drunk saw lots of compromising photos that did not tell the full story now we are at a point that people are broadcasting this shit live holly hell,3,
77103,premeditated drinking and driving is that a thing because she admitted to i,3,
77104,very happy she did nt hurt anyone  or herself,1,
77105,like it or not  this is pretty standard for 1st time dwi offenses especially since there was nt a wreck or damage to property,1,
77106,this is great pr for periscop,1,
77107,driving drunk is not easy,1,
77108,what is 10 day weekend work release,1,
77109,at first i thought this was a reasonable charge  but when i read the article it said that she was actually driving with a flat tire most drunks are smart enough to avoid driving on a flat  this woman is an idiot and deserves a harsh punishment she was intoxicated enough to seriously endanger the lives of others  if an officer had nt pulled her over i m sure she would have caused some serious damage,,
77110,that s cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work releas,,
77111,well it s not like you can prove that she was actually intoxicated  so the fact that she was nt punished seems appropriate,,
77112,and my mom wonders why i m not married,,
77115,that article is really light on details  does anyone know why this happened  did the guy not respond to a court summons or something along those lines  is nt a default the judgement the usual result in that situation,9,
77116,this happened in feb  2003 in minnesota as well  article   http  wwwmndailycom20030214usmarshalsarreststudentloandebtorstwincities,9,
77117,what happens if you literally ca nt pay your loans  asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11  just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job  edit  something a lot of you do nt seem to realize is that these were private loans there s no forgiveness with those,9,
77118,not really too much context given here  so it s hard to guess at the actual situation  but federal student loans  at least direct loans and the majority of those older loans passed back to fsa as they phased out the guarantee programs  do nt get sold to private collection agencies at this time maybe that part happened a while back  before current policies went into place and the collectors are taking advantage of the protections that federallyoriginated loans have  anyway  for people who are interested in learning more about how defaulted federal student loans are being collected today   check this out   https  wwwfbogovindex  s  opportunityamp  mode  formamp  id  216a8418f8e71f0c9c3475946ab100f8amp  tab  coreamp  _cview  1  they re currently in the middle of contracting new private collection agencies to service defaulted loans and you can see in the rfp documents how agencies are being scored and how that ties into account assignments  basically  for those who do nt feel like running through all of it  the big emphasis for student loan collections now is getting people through affordable rehabilitation options and into incomedriven repayment plans placements look like they re going to be based about 50  on careful regulatory compliance and borrower satisfaction surveys  which would make it extremely difficult for high pressure collections tactics to work out in the long run  none of that changes this story  just thought it was interesting in light of some of the comments i ve read that indicate people believe strongarm collection tactics for student loans will always be the norm  tldr  they re at least trying to throw a friendly paint job over the horribly broken federal student loan system these days,9,
77119,if you dont show up to court after you have been served this is what happens he has been ignoring collection attempts  he got served and ignored that too im not in favor of this man being arrested but you cant ignore court summons if you get served you have to go,9,
77120,upconwell said it best  gt  you are reading way to much into the article no one said they were violent no one said they had their guns drawn they are us marshals  they carry guns  every god damn day   gt  they probably went to his door  knocked he answered and they said  hey  we have a warrant for you for failing to appear in a federal court   he probably said  oh shit let me get some pants  gt  no violence  no guns drawn  everything was pretty standard and nonviolent  gt  plus  it should be noted that he was not arrested for failing to pay student loans  he was arrested for violating a court order,9,
77121,how do you not pay a  1500 loan after 30 friggin years,9,
77122,gt  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  this almost reads like satire,9,
77123,i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors,9,
77124,where in this article did it say  guns drawn  as most people are stating here  it says  with guns   every on duty us marshal goes through their day  with guns   someone signed a contract for a loan  and then spends almost three decades not paying it i agree that a police force should nt have been used there are financial measures that can be taken upon default of a loan rather than criminal  but i m really surprised by the circle jerk that s happening over a fox news article,9,
77125,can i get a misleading title please,8,
77126,you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day,6,
77127,lol  you guys are so gullible the guy dodged this debt and refused to engage the proper authorities for 25 years this is nt a new college graduate that missed one payment then you have the cascade of predictable posts stating  boot lickers    debtors prison  and how in 30 years this will be the watershed moment we all look back to as we are enslaved by the government this is a statement case the feds took an extreme example and made an extreme example of this putz the goal of this action is compliance and to get folks to not ignore their obligations the money spent on this will scare the other million folks that are past due to actually pick up the phone and engage them to resolve the debt no one held a gun to this guy s head to sign up for the student loans and no one was stopping him for 25 years from making a payment plan for the remaining  1500 this guy deserved it and as a tax payer this is ok by me,9,
77128,real story here dude was sued by the united state of america  he refused to appear  a default judgment was issued against him  he refused to appear for postjudgment depositions  judge issued an order directing him to appear in court  he ignored it and then the judge issued an arrest warrantincareration order and federal judges use us marshalls to enforce their orders  so he was nt arrested for having old student loans he was arrested for refusing to comply with a direct order from the judge  http  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386htm,8,
77129,that dude could not come up with  1500 in 29 years,8,
77130, a few years ago congress allowed the private sector to contract for student loan collections and so you have these private companies who are doing this  i find this scary  even though i have no student loans to pay off they dragged this dude to court and made him sign an agreement in front of their private attorney he had no attorney present  and was nt read any rights  edit  quote is from the video,9,
77131,forever grateful i graduated with minimal student loans ca nt ignore bills for 25 years though  regardless of what those payments stem from from reading through the comments here  it seems like incomebased payment option is the smartest option,6,
77132,i wish my student loan balance was  1500,6,
77133,i knew this story was light on facts turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies  source   yahoo finance   https  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386html,6,
77134,gt  our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is nt the first and wo nt be the last  this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least,8,
77135,he was nt arrested for not paying his loan  he was arrested for not showing up in court  and the marshals did nt storm his house guns blazing they had guns  with them   like every other cop in the entire country,7,
77136,if you take money and have no plans on paying it back  it s called stealing,9,
77137,right the debt collectors just bought the debt  payed the filing fees to bring the case to court  threatened the man with their now official   pay us or else  and when he did not they used their settlement to have him arrested by the marshals nope  no government officers for hire here  just good old debt collection paid and serviced through the courts,5,
77138,til that most people have no understanding how the court system works  yes  civil attorneys can issue subpoenas  yes  a court can hold you in contempt if you fail to appear yes  a potential punishment for contempt is a bench warrant for your arrest  tl  dr  you can not simply ignore subpoenas you may go to jail,5,
77139,writing and publishing articles like this is dangerous the author offered a sensationalist angle on the  story  while leaving out key elements of why they were there in the first place ie missing court summons this is highly unethical and paints the federal government into a larger narrative that fox has been going for basically  rallying people by emotion not logic,5,
77140,this just in  there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government film at 1,5,
77141,student loans were made with certain assumptions about the future of the economy  both on the part of the schools  the tuition they charge   the lenders  and the student people should be required to pay their student loans but they should be adjusted downward  edit  this guy had a loan for  1500 measly bucks and did nt make any payments in 30 years  i would like to know if he was destitute  or just decided  fuck you everyone  i want to keep my money ,8,
77142,misleading title the marshals service will  arrest  you if you fail to show up for a court appearance you are not being tossed in jail  you are being hauled into court when you refused to answer a summons  from the article   paul aker says he was arrested at his home last week for a  1500 federal student loan he received in 1987  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  does anyone feel sorry for this man   1500  be serious,7,
77143,if i did nt pay back a federal loan for 29 years  i d kind of expect for there to be negative effects this dude did nt pay his loan  including when he was taken to court over it and received a judgment from the court specifically telling him to pay it if you ignore a court order  you re gon na have a bad time  i mean yes  the financial aid system needs to be fixed  but they re going after people who purposely are nt paying their loans which is a surprising amount of people  given how many refund chasers there are in the world for anyone else  there are programs like deferment options  sliding payscales  and whatever else along with loan forgiveness after 20 years  it s a shitty system  but this guy s case is not going to be the one to change it because he does nt deserve to have people dying on his hill for his particular cause,7,
77144,i m socialist and firmly believe that education and medical care should be paid for by federal government out of contributions that we make  however with that said  if you are contributing member of society you have to be a special kind of asshole not to repay  1500 loan over the period of 29 years no matter what was that loan used for,8,
77145,why is this news,3,
77146,dude got letters in his mail for months to pay and appear in court  this doesnt just come out of the blue he refused to show up to court multiple times thats a criminal offense,5,
77147,the revolution will not be subsidize,5,
77148,the whole student loan thing is a complete disaste,6,
77149,talk is cheap  between the intelligence agencies  an the lack of marijuana decriminalizatoinlegalizatoin  obama is nt that idfferent from previous administration,5,
77150,just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to the paper really is nt worth it otherwise college is becoming a joke anyways,5,
77151,every interaction i have ever had with navient  they have done everything they can to work with me  is your payment affordable  would you like a deferment  etc  i have had to take them up on that because of divorce not saying that is everyone s experience but they have nt been the loan sharks everyone else seems to act like they are just one man s experience though,5,
77154,if you need to call a suicide hotline the va is garbage i ve used the military one source when i was having a mental breakdown one of the ladies sat on the phone with me and just talked for almost an hour here is their number 8003429647 i highly recommend it these arent va employees they are licenced counselors and dont get paid by how many calls they answer so they will take there time and make sure you are stable if you are still active duty or even reserves i believe they still do one on one counseling sessions that will not be documented in anyway so no fear of reprisal  here is another one you can call  text  or message https  wwwveteranscrisislinenetmobile  this one connects you to contracted va employees so not the ones you get normally although the same thing happens if its full  it will reroute you  that s the mobile link sorry if you need something else do nt settle for poor service get help  military crisis line through the military crisis line  a person in need can talk or chat confidentially with a trained counselor in as quickly and easily as a single phone call or click of a mouse the military crisis line  is available 247 and free for activeduty  guard and reserve members  their families and friends can be reached in the united states at 8002738255  then press 1 can be reached in europe at 0080012738255 or dsn 118  the tollfree service in europe may not be available through all carriers or in all countries  can be reached in korea at 0808 555 118 or dsn 118 can be reached in afghanistan at 00 1 800 273 8255 or dsn 111 offers confidential online chat at the military crisis line website or by texting to 838255 another edit  if anyone needs to talk please feel free to contact me shit  send me a pm and i ll give you my number and we can talk i ve lost too many friends to suicide and hate how this cycle perpetuates itself,8,
77155,because america loves her servicemen and women so she wants them to help themselve,8,
77156,i have been calling the helpline everyday for 2 weeks it is a recorded message saying call back later we are busy just then general va helpline,7,
77157,the problem with the va  like most other government agencies  is that there is no accountability when you ca nt fire workers who are lazy  negligent  or worthless  you end up with a disfunctional organization filled with lazy  negligent  and worthless people,7,
77158,yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country,4,
77159,i have a pretty easy solution  why do nt overflow suicide calls just get forwarded to the regular suicide hotline  s   sure its probably better to deal with someone specifically trained to deal with service men and women but anyone is better then a voicemail,6,
77160,that vm box is gon na get overloaded quic,3,
77161,pissing off trained military personnel seems like a dumb idea in the long ru,3,
77162,and sanders wants to make this available for everyone it s not the money that causes this agency to be this way it s the nature of the federal government,4,
77163,it is nt a secret that the va is understaffed that is the biggest issue with the va and if they had more funding for labor costs  they would be in a far better spot,1,
77164,i ve been getting this for over a month the one time i did connect  the estimated wait time was 55 minutes,1,
77165,started up telepsyche again trying to make some progress a pending appointment looms  and i am very much looking forward to it  until she calls me and tells me they re cancelling it  i get a couple of appoints out of them  and then someone is sick  or changes positions there s no way for me to develop a healthy trusting relationship with my therapist  this is not an effective way to heal  so fuck it i ll go till i burn out in a glorious explosion of give a fucks and poop,1,
77166,remember when the va story broke it was really big news and everyone was talking about it and it was front page on reddit  nothing s changed  stories keep coming out about how nothing s changed  but no one cares either because it s not new anymore  or because of politics  or maybe both i do nt know,1,
77167,can anyone explain why the va is so dysfunctional  in short  i do nt get it it seems like they have tons of money but ca nt get their shit together,1,
77168,tell me more about how universal healthcare will be awesome for the rest of us,,
77169,socialized healthcare no thanks,,
77170,governmentrun anything is a disaster,,
77172,fucking sad how this was nt described as an act of terrorism i guess that title is reserved for nonchristians,9,
77173,it is sad that it closed even for a short time people like fiorina do nt give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time,8,
77174,definitely not terrorism though  just a little rampage  you know he was probably having a bad day or something,8,
77175,good for them  dont let those freedom hating assholes scare you away from your job,8,
77176,how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him,4,
77177,is carly out of the race yet  i do nt think that rightwing  fringe conartist is done riling up her terrorist sect,6,
77178,deadly rampage  was  terrorist attack  a little too onthenose,6,
77179,why does this headline say  deadly rampage  and not  christian terrorism ,6,
77180,now i m not a fan of abortions but who the hell can think to themselves i know how to stop babies from being aborted  i ll just shoot all the moms and their doctors  absolute lunatic,3,
77181,thank god its back open now we can get back to crushing fetus  heads and sucking their brains out like normal people,,
77182,on president s day   the gaul,,
77183,so  someone went on a shooting rampage and killed people in order to stop planned parenthood from killing people  but now planned parenthood is open again  and proudly killing people  well  i am glad that worked out the entire thing makes tons of sense,,
77184,pp is where there is regular deadly rampages against unborn babies,,
77185,planned parenthood is basically condoms and the oklahoma city bombing,,
77187,i lived 200yds from a burn pit when i was there in 04 i had some skin disease for about 2 years after iraq and some kind of asthma the va did nt give a shit then and they still do nt care  so  i got that goin for me,9,
77188,i was in tikrit  cob speicher  from 08 to 09 i lived a few hundred feet from the  burn pit  it was basically a huge junk yard with 3 huge constantly burning rectangular pits they were about 75 feet long and 50 feet across iirc you could see black or white smoke billowing from the area all the time i had to go there at least once a week to dump trash imagine standing over a red hot fire throwing junk off the back of a flatbed truck while it was 130 degrees outside sometimes the smog was so thick driving through the junk yard  that you could nt see 50 feet in front of you the smoke would almost always linger around the base and it smelled awful olfactory fatigue did not apply here it always smelled no matter how long you d be  exposed  you never got used to it never mind that they burned our shit right next door i remember one day we had to do a pt test the 2 mile run was on the same road as the burn pit smoke everywhere nobody passed that day some people were puking at the end i usually ran a 13  45 2 mile and i remember getting over 17 minutes i was gasping for air at the end we all thought the course was marked out incorrectly  but when we measured it later that day it was exactly 2 miles needless to say  nobody ever had any respiratory protection around these things  ever nor were we ever told we needed them i mean we had our gas masks in our gear  but nobody wanted to be  that guy  damn  we used to joke about it all the time whenever someone would start spewing some  war story   or when some freshoutabasic private would try to tell us about  that one time my drill sergeant made us do this  story   at the end we d say   yeah  but have you ever been to the burn pit    then we d laugh it off i guess it s not so funny anymore,8,
77189,my husband  half  jokes about the cancer he s going to get from the burn pits in afghanistan from what he described  they were horrible,7,
77190,this hits close to home we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight i really need to get this checked out,7,
77191,i can understand why burning trash and human waste may be unavoidable in certain military circumstances like in those remote outposts in afghanistan that might house 1520 people  there really are nt any good alternatives  however it seems less defensible to not have invested in better infrastructure once you had permanent bases the size of small cities  once you re at the point where soldiers had their own little airconditioned houses made out of cargo containers with air conditioning  satellite television  and onbase burger king it seems like you can probably invest in some proper trash incinerators instead of open burn pits,7,
77192,gt  though the us government disputes it well  color me surprised,8,
77193,a tsgt i know died recently from cancer he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family he was 32 his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer,7,
77194, support our troops with a ribbon sticker   that will definitely make up for all the fucked up shit the government puts them through,7,
77195,not surprised saw a guy in the va who used to jog through the base with his unitteam  not sure of the terminology   breathing in the smoke from one of these every day for 4 years he had some chronic lung condition we were working up  and said a couple of his buddies also have lung problems now otherwise perfectly healthy 40 years old  completely unnecessary illness due to stupidity andor apathy,6,
77196,http  wwwpublichealthvagovexposurescamplejeune for decades  the government knowingly allowed service members and their dependents to consume contaminated tap water fifteen diseases are recognized to have a direct relation to the contamination but many more are cropping up yet the government wo nt recognize those  yet   and they re filing motions to have claims tossed out based on statute of limitations  even though the government did nt even announce the contamination until over a decade after the wells were closed  this is nt just an agent orange or iraq war contamination where soldiers were exposed and have problems babies born at the base hospital hadhave an alarmingly high rate of birth defects but nothing is being done about it and the va continues to deny claims we ll just go ahead and add this one to the list,6,
77197,uhh i ve had a severe cough for 34 years now  since coming back from afghanistan  it ll get so bad  that i ll cough until i throw up  and then cough more  the va said it was normal i m sure they know what they re talking about i feel fine,6,
77198,i remember having to sit through a 2 hour briefing the first week i arrived in iraq  back in 2008 we were told that scientists verified that the burn pit on base was not a detriment to our health  then we had to sign forms when i returned stateside  there were quite a few reports of people having respiratory issues after returning from deployment  the va also denied that any illnesses were related to desert storm it took a long time for anyone other than veterans to admit that desert storm syndrome was a real thing  and then said veterans had to go through the gauntlet of proving their illnesses were related to their deployment,7,
77199,goddamn  it s unbelievable the way vets are treated shame,6,
77200,government does nt give a fuck about veterans,5,
77201,my 36yo buddy was just diagnosed with nonhodgkens lymphoma when he visited the va to do the paperwork they asked what bases he served at overseas  and literally had a list of diseases to reference per base just got a  yep  here it is probably from the burn pit  from the clerk thumbing down the list when he told me i was blown away  why is nt there any followup with soldiers who served at these bases    even a simple  you may want to get screened  when he returned from service would have given us some hope of getting in front of it it s incredibly irritating,5,
77202,the us lying about iraq and afghanistan  nah  never happen,7,
77203,do nt worry guys we ll take care of your medical needs when you come home oh wait,5,
77204,do nt forget area 51 they had burn pits like you would nt believe stealth materiels that had top secret components in them the poor guys that were exposed to all of this could nt even go for help  many died in secrecy  i know i was exposed to vaporized depleted uranium and who knows what else i have a sort of bet with my self that i ll die an early death,5,
77205,so  the dod did nt learn any lessons from previous burn pits  i mean  when you have to declassify area 51 because of workers health decline due to burn pits  you d think you d remember this shit is wrong,5,
77206, though he returned home safely in september 2009  he woke up one day a few months later with an inexplicable headache  numbness in his limbs and paralysis on one side of his body beau had suffered a mild stroke his health deteriorated  and he was diagnosed with brain cancer less than two years later  he died at the age of 46  holy fuck    fuck wars and politicians that start them,4,
77207,the us govt so cares about its troops,7,
77208,i ve known military to have permanent letters added to their medical records saying they have been exposed to the worst man made hazarddisaster since chernobyl,4,
77209,does kaf still have the shit pond  on another note  im going to have this checked out the va has this on their website somewhere  they sent an email,4,
77210,there are so many things wrong with this i do nt even know what to say  let s just purposefully burn hazardous material  petroleum products  chemicals  and batteries next to our camp oh  and throw some explosives in there while you re at it and vaporizes all that shit so we can breath it in are you kidding me,4,
77211,holy shit  my friend who was on the poop burning detail a bunch of times died of throat cancer earlier this year my first thought was it was the poop burning that did it  and i m concerned as well because i did my fair share of that as well,4,
77212,where we lived there was a burn pit that was nearby and the smoke would always float over to where we were  as of yet i dont have any symptoms but i do have a begine growth in my head  i have had it checked but i am paranoid that it could become bad ,4,
77213,little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did nt have to bother to actually lob chemicalbio weapons at us we d send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chembio bomb themselves  did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney,4,
77214,every time i allow myself a shred of regret for not enlisting  i remind myself that this kind of shit is what the us does to its soldiers fuck that i respect your service and all that  but fuck that shit,1,
77215,every goddamn war the military has to do something that exposes troops to dangerous chemicals,3,
77216,makes me wonder  i was at camp addertallil back in 2010  2011  what was i exposed to,3,
77217,i was in taji in 2011 2 people got cancer after our deployment  lots of people were having breathing problems we were right next to the tank graveyard and the burn pit was constantly going in our rush to shut down theater i ve gotten lung infections every year since then,3,
77218,just like at area 51  same shit never changes,3,
77219,thank god i saved my hazardous exposure memos from balad and taji if ne1 needs message privatel,3,
77220,ctrlf  kandahar poo pond  no results son  i am disappoint,3,
77221,where is this going to lead to,3,
77222,the horrors of our war in iraq seem to never en,3,
77223,i read that as  us military burns pit bulls ,3,
77224,do nt know if anyone who got sick is interested in  this   http  wwwgelmanscomreadingroomtabid65ctlarticleviewmid372articleid526burnpitsclaimsaspx  but here ya go,3,
77225,ca nt be  bush lied  right  right ,3,
77226,my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well,1,
77227,that was one messy cakewalk,5,
77228,they should turn on the masters and their supporters,3,
77229,so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them,3,
77230,i thought iraq did nt have wmd s,4,
77231,be sure and vote gop they re the gift that keeps on giving   you give cancer to the army you have  not the army you wish you had,1,
77232,such a simple solution  rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacement,,
77233,am i the only one who read that at first as burn pit bulls,,
77235,so not only are these disputed  there are now long term  long range weapons on them,1,
77237,thats bad news for all the 711 in our town that take the,8,
77238,does nt this just translate into fewer places for poor people to buy food,7,
77239, 711 cashiers will now have to ring up cigarettes as organic kale instead of hot pockets,7,
77240,on the other hand  if the business stops taking food stamps entirely  not only can they not get the kale you want to make them eat  but they also ca nt get a loaf of bread or gallon of milk unless they start selling their food stamps to get cash to buy the milk and bread so the business still makes their money  the amount of food stamp fraud goes up  and the poor that you claim to be helping are getting even less food  healthy or otherwise  because of the food stampcash exchange rate,4,
77241,why are nt food stamps like wic  with wic you get vouchers for specific food items these items cover the basic food groups and align with a certain amount of nutritional value  meanwhile  you can buy friggin monster energy drinks with food stamps that makes no sense  regardless if you are looking at it from a healthy standpoint or a taxpayer standpoint,6,
77242,if obesity and other nutrition related issues are such a problem among the poor  would nt it be more cost effective to do away with food stamps and implement something like a food box program instead  in other words would the cost of labor to package and ship prepared food boxes in bulk to grocery stores and distribution centers be offset by what would be saved in reduced healthcare costs  imagine a program where you list the people in your household  any allergies or specific requirements and a box is prepared to supplement your family for a week it could contain things like rice  beans  canned or pouched goods like meats  vegetables and fruits  dried oatmeal and cereals  powdered milk  cooking oil every month they could receive a selection of 5 spices  salt and pepper and even a recipe pamphlet if in addition to the box  they started a program where grocery stores and produce growers could drop off older or bruised produce  people could pick some up for free when they picked up their boxes,7,
77243,what if the healthy foods do nt sell  are they still forced to stock them  would nt you think the actual grocers in the neighborhood would have a better sense of what their customers want than the federal government,4,
77244,no they ll stop or pack up and leave  ahhhincentives,5,
77245,you can lead them to water  but you ca nt make them drin,5,
77246,we have jackinthebox here in phoenix that has we accept ebt  signs up all over pisses me off  same thing at the gas station when you see children without any parents around loading up on overpriced candy and soda and  sure enough  out comes the ebt card or even worse is when they are  with  the adult and loading up on dog shit  food stamps should only be foractual food,1,
77247,honestly this will be great  the state  should  be very involved in what people eat for free,1,
77248,another  good intention  bad policy,1,
77249,this is the dark side of welfare  the constitution is completely circumvented the government has the power to cajole and pressure when it is putting stipulations on the money it gave out the government is capable of doing things it would never have the power of doing otherwise  like forcing a business to carry certain products  or forcing a person to apply for jobs or eventually  forcing people to work at government labor jobs,1,
77250,because dontravious demands fresh cilantro,3,
77251,i wonder how much crime in a store would go down if the store was no longer food stamp approved,1,
77254,god  this pisses me off gay marriage has nothing to do with you what two gay people do in the comfort of their own homes is none of your business,6,

77257,it s fun that the government has turned the words freedom and patriot in to code words for tyrannical  and selfish,1,
77258,okay  i m not american  but did nt the senate legalise homosexual marriage  so is nt this unconstitutional,1,
77259,allowing people to do what they want with their own property is nt antigay  it s profreedom and proequality the right to follow your on conscience is as fundamental as the right to follow your own gender identity equality under the law is as far as laws should go,1,
77260,can anyone say hillbilly,,

77344,isps do nt actually want to spy on their customers like that it costs more money to put systems in place to do so and to maintain and operate those systems on top of that  it will only bring them bad press that could piss off customers  cox is basically saying  fuck you i m not taking a significant financial hit to spy on our customers so you can sue them and make money for yourself  they are doing the right thing  and the right thing also happens to be in their best business interest,9,
77345,good guy cox  not selling out their customers  they actually have super reliable internet no outages in any of my apartments so far,9,

77347,that s nice  but i m still going to run a vpn,8,
77348,all in all i ve been pretty happy with cox as an isp i ve used them in two different cities and it s always been reliable and fast i pay for 300mbps service and always get those speeds  usually higher almost no outages they re putting in 1gbs service in many of their cities right now  including mine  my biggest gripe with them is they have a soft data cap of 2 tb for my tier they do not enforce the caps at all but the fact that they exist means they are probably toying with the idea and there would be nothing to stop them from going evil since they are a monopoly like every other major isp it s like a benevolent dictatorship  http  wwwspeedtestnetmyresult5089441276 that s with a netflix stream going on in another room right now,9,
77349,this must be a new thing many a year s ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did nt even know what that was  none of us knew what that even was and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi,7,
77350,i ve been really happy with cox for an isp both personally and professionally here in okc personally  out of nowhere they bumped my at home connection from 15mbit to 100mbit and my bill  went down  30  all out of nowhere  without me saying a word internet is always up  not throttled  and they have decent support if it s needed  professionally at my job i ran in ip phone deployment with them for our main office  3 satellite offices they were there 100  of the way i have personal names and numbers to call in the event of issues outside of the scope of my support as the companies it admin  and when we ve needed someone on site to climb a pole for instance their longest response time was 45 minutes  i know this sounds like rhailcorporate but the fact is out of all the isps i ve had  comcast  qwest  charter  etc  they ve been the best that s not saying they should nt and could nt be better  but they re angels next to the others  in fact they proactively contact me at work every once and awhile to check on things which i greatly appreciate and they bring us cookies every month yes  our isp brings yes cookies no  we re not a big company 9 employees they re just nice,8,
77351,basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum,8,
77352,i used to work for cox in the field and inside cox did have a department that would monitor massive down loading and uploading but they did away with it shortly after i got there  within a year cox ca nt afford to lose customers right now so it s no surprise they are nt allowing this if they did then they would go out of business from customer loss i survived their huge layoff and realignment,5,
77353,this is nothing new from cox i have had cox internet for over 10 years and worked for them a few years ago they have always had this attitude toward it s customers the customer pays for internet access  cox provides internet access they do nt even enforce data caps  at least in oklahoma   i have received a few emails due to using so much data suggesting that i switch to a business plan to maximize my speed  but have never been charged extra or cut off due to exceeding a data cap,7,
77354,gt  last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers  what the actual fucking fuck,6,
77355,as a customer this is the first good thing i ve ever heard from cox,4,
77356,not true from my experience,3,
77357,i ve had them as an isp for several years and they re excellent i did have one month where i went over my allowed bandwidth limit  300 gb on a 50 mbps down plan   and all i got was an email saying  do nt do that again   no throttling or charges or anything on 100 mbps down plan right now and i usually get 110 at least they re great  come out to me if i m having internet trouble that s not solved by online support  etc pretty good basically  i love cox and i m very satisfied with how much i get,3,

77361,not as nice as it sounds if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do nt catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status  eg that they do nt have any liabilityresponsibility for what people use their pipe for   most carriers are  very  vested in not being the internet police,3,
77362,i m guessing that if they had a way to monetize it and add to the bottom line  they d be very supportive,3,

77364,cox is actually a familyowned business one of the major interest holders is a 96 year old woman who inherited from her father  she had been running it with her sister until her death in 2007   i happen to think they re one of the leastshady isp and cable providers out there  they also own the travel channel  which is a pretty great channel,5,
77365,i thought this was talking about jesse cox,4,
77366,i work for cox corporate in a startup tech company  and this makes me so happy  btw  they re just as decent an employer as they are an isp compan,3,
77367,cox is spying like a champ  rest assured you have to be quite innocent or high on meth to think they have nt supplied info to big brother and his little brothers  and will not in the future,3,

77391,i certainly do nt necessarily agree with public funds being used for a sports stadium  and i definitely do nt agree with nepotism  but i think criticizing mike illitch somehow taking advantage of detroit is a shortsighted mistake had it not been for mr illitch pretty much singlehandily reinvesting in a city everyone wanted to leave behind over the last 20 years  the city would nt even be close to back on a path to relevancy  whether you want to believe it is or not   the other thing to consider is that this new complex not only brings commerce to an area that was a combination of blight and open fields  it also brings quite a few jobs to the city  as well as some stateoftheart buildings that will bring commerce and international travelers to the area for a variety of reasons  conferences  concerts  etc   this all equals more money for the city of detroit  which is why they re willing to make the investment in the first place   and another part of a blightfilled neighborhood updated and usable for the future  this is a sticky situation that reeks of an unfortunate quidproquo  but when it comes to what is good for the city of detroit  it s hard to argue that anyone has anything on the passion and dedication of mike illitch,9,
77392,how in the fuck are there no comments about the red wings owner s hair  ,9,
77393,everyone talks about the insanity in pro sports these days  yet no one mentions  public or private  universities  which are all nonprofit  spending massive amounts of their cash on stadiums  athletic facilities  etc it s the same thing if the universities are public  and its only marginally different if they re private the reason they have that money in the first place is federallysubsidized student loans,8,
77394,lol illitch has done more for the city of detroit than any other person in the last 50 years fuck off,9,
77395,so he did a good job for the team and the owner offered him more money for a better job  happens all the time  kids,6,
77396,is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit  or ford field  most people would not step foot downtown if it was nt for those two places i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do nt bring forth revitalization like intendedbut the only article i ve read was about stadiums in la and sf,6,
77397,before you jump on the  why ca nt detroit use the money for things that actually matter  train   here s   http  wwwcrainsdetroitcomarticle20140921news309219990oncostfinancingofwingsarenahereareanswers  an article outlining the finances of this massive project  edit  s  for those not wanting to click  gt  the initial base price is  450 million problems  changes and added amenities could increase that final cost anything beyond  450 million must be paid by the ilitches  gt  the michigan strategic fund will sell  450 million in two series of bonds they will be divided into  250 million in series a bonds that will be backed by property taxes already captured by the downtown development authority the  200 million in series b bonds will be backed by the  115 million olympia development has agreed to pay the dda for bond retirement  gt  the ilitches  through olympia  will pay  200 million of the bond debt detroit s dda  via its property tax capture ability  will pay back  250 million of the bonds new yorkbased merrill lynch  a division of bank of america  which has pledged to buy all the publicly backed series a bonds in the deal it will then sell the bonds to the public dallasbased comerica bank inc will buy the series b bonds backed by olympia s money the bank  formerly based in detroit  has the naming rights to comerica park  where the ilitchowned detroit tigers play comerica intends to keep the bonds on its books rather then sell them,8,
77398, misleading title   https  wwwredditcomrhockeycomments45xs0mdetroit_contractor_who_negotiated_285_million_ind00vnke   it was state money  not detroit s also  ilitch footed most of the bill himself  or through his company   please research  the district  and see their plans for it before passing judgement,9,
77399,clickbait no one around here is remotely upset about taxpayer funds going to a new stadium for the most popular team in town we re not really unhappy about the new development for business and residences that is happening and we re not raising any concerns about the effort to revitalize the city  detroit is climbing out of a hole created by the corruption of influential individuals local business and leaders have been more beneficial in this process than any other group and this stadium  and the district surrounding it are seen as victories in this effort,8,
77400,ah  a local spin on the old  congressperson becomes lobbyist  setup,5,
77401,they are literally building new district for the city not just an arena  a whole new district development is what the city needs and frankly  detroit politics have always been just a  wee  bit corrup,4,

77406,if you re a bernie supporter  who thinks a public funded  1 trillion dollar infrastructure package is a good deal because jobs  but is outraged by the state of michigan investing  285 million in the renovationrevitalization of its  largest city  then you might want to reexamine one of those positions,6,
77407,for all the people complaining about spending the money on the new stadium and  less mentioned  surrounding developments  all i can say is it will be more than worth it if it fixes up that area governments of all levels have been dumping money into the cass corridor since the early days of johnson s great society programs with any luck this will finally be a solution that stick,7,
77408,itt  out of staters have no fucking idea about the current state of economics in detroit and how great this project is going to be for the city  i do nt even know where to begin with this article it s clear the author did nt talk to a single person in the city or state or even try to get a feel for the public opinion on the topic including garbage clickbait phrases like the previous article titled  detroit scam city  how the red wings took hockeytown for all it had  has to be one of the dumbest fucking things i ve ever read  when detroit was at its absolute rock bottom worst  going to joe louis arena was probably the only reason suburban white people would ever go into the city and spend money now mike ilitch wants to build a gigantic urban development project including restaurants  shopping stores    apartment complexes   and oh yeah a brand new stateoftheart arena for one of the most successful hockey teams of all time  they have nt missed the playoffs since before i was born  25 years ago they are a big deal and have been for decades   oh  and it s being built at the exact time there s an influx of young people and new businesses into the the city which will create more upward momentum  yes  the city is helping pay for it the city also got a lot of input on it design  layout  and what additional projects would be built along with the arena this happens in every single city an arenastadium is built i do nt necessarily think that s how it should work but the fact of the matter is that this is how these deals are made and the city absolutely needs projects like this if it wants to continue on its upward trend  also attacks on mike ilitch in this article and this thread are disgusting illitch has been a controversial figure for a long time but his story is like example of the american dream you d see in fiction his parents were poor immigrants  he grew up in detroit joined the marines played minor league baseball for the team he now owns opens up a mom and pop pizza place and creates an empire out of it  gets rich while creating jobs and doing public works projects for the city he grew up in even though it s a complete shit hole mike ilitch has been spending  and yes  making  money in detroit for years mike ilitch was there in the 90 s and early 00 s before there was ever a housing crash in the rest of the country the man is nt a saint but if it were nt for him there would be a lot less charities and projects being invested in now he wants to build a project the city desperately needs with the city s help and input  and he s getting shit on by some dumb ass  journalist  that ca nt get their facts straight  endran,7,

77434,gt  nearly 15 million girls  some as young as eight or nine so  some as young as eight,9,
77435,37000 child marriages every day  if that s the case why are these people shocked  surely they must see these pedo photoshoots on the reg,9,
77436,these statistics seem unreliable estimated 12 billion new child marriages by 2050  even taking the 37000 a day estimate at face value that would only get you to 500 million by 2050  i mean seriously  assuming population growth rates remain unchanged  unlikely as the rate is slowing significantly  there will only be  47 billion women born under the age of 8 by 2050 is it truly believable that a quarter of women born in the next 34 years are going to be placed into a child marriage,8,

77474,interesting though   since 2005  texas has prosecuted 38 juveniles for intoxication manslaughter or intoxication assault only three were sent to the adult system  and half of all cases resulted in probation of some kind  i think this is more telling of the justice system  and accessibility to competent  quality counsel it s clear money buys better legal counsel  but if the government subsidized public defense more heavily  the outcomes would clearly be different,9,

77483,i love how this article just glosses over the fact that arellano had previous dui convictions which is why he did nt receive the same sentence  this was couch s first dui case which is why he got probation  as texas takes the rehab route  but whatever lets rage and ignore the fact,8,
77484,is everyone here honestly  seriously shocked that money gets you out of trouble  am i taking crazy pills,5,
77485,going beyond the dae legal system is corrupt  circlejerk in this thread  there are certainly some differences in these cases firstly  the arellano case  the other one in the article  happened in 2007  six years before couch s trial likewise  the article says that arellano had driven while intoxicated and drank underage before  which means that he would ve had a greater chance of being moved to an adult trial meanwhile  couch had no prior violations of the law  meaning that he could nt be moved to an adult court,6,
77486,i understand what you are trying to do with your anecdotal case comparisons however  they are nt comparable cases when you consider all the factors  including criminal history  but  even if you ignore all the other factors  i know of a white 20 yo male from a fairly wealthy family in my area who was sent to prison for a year based on a drunk driving accident so my anecdotal evidence shows similar punishment to your anecdotal case thereby anecdotally refuting your point,8,
77487,the real crime here those eyebrow,6,

77501,it did nt seem to mention how they had the same judge  we ve already established this same judge would have been open to giving a similar sentence to a poor minority because she tried to do just that keep making this a race issue  though lord knows the media loves to stir up ignorant poor folks  also  anyone who comes to the us illegally and kills is citizens deserves little sympathy he was a juvenile  so it would be appropriate to release him and deport him  i do nt understand the need to distort issues to make tbem about race we already have enough problems it s already an established fact that those with the means to afford a lawyer fair better than those who do nt,3,

77558,good for him  football does nt have to be a concussion prone sport it started as the american version of rugby  and evolved into the form we see today  and can just as properly evolve into something that is nt effectively a form of human sacrifice  part of how it evolved is the career of pop warner  the coach of the carlisle indian school he kept  how to put it  coaching like a lawyer  and coming up with clever ways to get an edge  that would then eb slapped down with rule changes  surely concussions justify rule changes too,7,
77559,i played football for 4 years in highschool started all 4 years i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fu,3,

77585,tl  dr  apple has to provide the means to extract encrypted data from the device fbi will then try to decrypt it  i assume by brute force  would would be easy for a 4digit pin   the interesting part is that the device is owned by farook s employer  the san bernardino county department of public health had they been following proper device protocol  they would already have administrator access to it  this was literally government property used for terrorism  and now unsearchable not due to the  encryption  boogeyman but their own ineptitude,7,

77587,i have this hunch that this is all for show and that the fbi has access through the nsa to all of this stuff why would they cancel prism  it s not like your average citizen can inspect the electronic infrastructure of this country and verify that  for example  metadata collection has stopped i think after edward snowden they sat in a room and decided to keep doing it and act like they were stopping it i would  i sound like a conspiracy theorist but i really do think the risks of terrorism are so great and siphoning data so easy that they re still doing it,1,

77597, bundy asked for a courtappointed attorney at his first hearing last week  still living off govt handouts i see,8,

77600,gt  the judge said bundy  69  is a flight risk and a danger to the community in the bail hearing tuesday afternoon in downtown portland i mean i ca nt really find a reason not to agree with that a 69 year old who does nt believe he s beholden to the law is as dangerous as a 29 year old who does nt believe he s beholden to the law,8,

77617,from what i ve read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops it looks like the taser use was justified sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca nt be deescalated otherwise  has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died,6,
77618,this is unacceptable tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are nt,7,
77619,he died 5 days later at a different hospital  clickbait headline i m sure we ll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death,6,

77740,this is a great thing people who are bashing him do not make much sense the monuments in dc are one of the united states  greatest treasures  and likewise they cost a lot to maintain let alone refurbish they are a public venue that is traversed by millions and are awesome to each person that visits  this guy decided to use some of his money to give back and better public places that reside in our nation capital and some see him as an asshole  it is one thing to be bitter about not having that kind of money  it is another thing to get pissed when someone with money gives back,7
77741,its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring,3
77742,good for him i remember the lincoln memorial being one of my more favorite monuments i d like to take my son there some day  so it s nice to see it will be upgraded and fixed up  to all the naysayers and negative commenters  fuck you,5
77743,in this thread hooray  what an awesome guy and  also fuck him  he should have used pennie,6
77744,how is he a philanthropist  he s giving money to statues  not to people maybe he s a philstatuist,5
77745,congratulations  you just bought  18 million worth of  charity shaming   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  aksowj8agwo ,3
77746,how dare that onepercenter not keep that money to themselves it s as if they are nt evil like sanders wants you to believ,1
77747,i think it s great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about what i do nt like is that there should nt even be an issue with funding for our monuments,4
77748,if we re committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i m all for it,1
77749,i wonder how many huge donations like this  maybe smaller  in the hundreds of thousands  have been made for national monuments pretty awesome someone did this wo reading the article  i have to imagine there s a good amount of rigmarole on the donor s end to ensure the donation goes to where the donor actually wanted govt accountability on any level in the us seems kind of weak lately,1
77750,all right  a 15000sqft exhibit room underneathkind of like the one in fallout ,3
77751,can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too,
77752,oh cool thanks  philanthropist guy,3
77753,wow  what an honorable thing to do  while 99  of people in his position would spend the money on useless crap  this guy chooses to spend his money on something so selfless and so much bigger than himself  this guy is a good 1  e,
77754,it d be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro,1
77755,that s nice for a full on rapist to do,
77756,let s laugh at people in need by blowing tens of millions on nonessential shit that basically benefits nobody in any significant way  edit  and get tax breaks from it too,1
77757,no matter what some peasant is going to whine rich guy should ve just kept his money to himself and these poors would nt even know  i thank him  i ll go to dc eventually the whiners here probably could nt afford any type of vacation  or if they could  only by living paycheck to paycheck,
77758,we are living in a new gilded age,
77759,i certainly appreciate what david has done here but  with all due respect to david  most americans would rather not see financial industry groups  like the carlyle group  suck economic resources out ofaway from most americans instead  we d prefer to pay for these efforts through widespread  robust economic opportunities and the tax contributions they make possible millions of americans and this nation have been greatly diminished as a result of the business activities of groups  like the carlyle group  over several decades  because of grotesque incomewealth inequality  the odds of seeing successful businesspeople like david rubinstein are greatly diminished he only got where he was because of the social ladder that used to exist in this nation,
77760,how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions,
77761,it s gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface themfight to take them down,
77762,those goddamn rich people are at it again  dammit if we could only find a way to tax away their wealth so we could spend it on poorly negotiated deals for mediocre roads and bridges,
77763,wow  what a waste of money,
77764,fixing stupid shit is hardly philanthropy,
77765,i m pretty sure there are roads around there that could have used that money  priorities  people,

77774,why cant everyone choose this option equally  badges dont grant extra right,5

77779, challenge accepted  sincerely  hackers,1
77780,it s an undesirable response to an undesirable reality that copkilling is getting it s own category as a hate crime,
77782,once the cop shows up to your convenience store robbery  it s time to call it quits  what the fuck did he think he was getting away with,9
77783,good on his father for turning in his son for this crime that cant be an easy thing to do but he did the right thing,9
77784,father of five  damn best wishes to officer couch and his loved ones,8
77785,sounds like he may make it gt   he s doing as good as can be expected   couch s father  alozo hardiman  told the station  it s touch and go we are praying for him and god knows best,7
77786,i believe we have gangs that are setting these kids up with a hair trigger  and along comes a cop that sets them off  we need to get to the root problem as well as locking up the kids,7
77787,that fucker is 19  looks 3,7
77788,i hope the cop gets better,7
77789,dont ever let this shithead have an ounce of freedo,8

77791,he s a really meanlooking kid  i do nt know if he always wears that scowl  or if it s just for the mugshot,5
77792,19 years old and your life s over for the contents of a cash register justwhy,3
77793,wish people would stop shooting cops it s making them all scared and trigger happy,1
77794,kinda looks like trayvon martin and mike brown had a kid,1
77795,where s all the blm people now  i mean it s a black cop and all conflict of interest  or does nt fit your super combo of white cop and dead black kid,
77796,i do nt understand reddit says that loggers and farmers have more dangerous jobs,
77797,another prime blm example,
77798,hope he gets a fair trial y,
77799,so this guy is innocent until proven guilty right  why is this investigation so short  we do nt know the details  why does it take a year to investigate an officer for shooting someone  and this takes a couple of days to charge this guy  is that disconnect enough to make anyone here question things enough to accept that there is a massive encompassing problem with our legal system  i always have to wonder because we see many of the same people calling for people to wait for details after an officer shoots someone  telling us not to be monday morning quarterbacks then stories like this pop up and we have those same people frothing at the mouth in this situation where it has nt been given the year plus of investigation that an officer who shoots someone would be given the guy is already guilty despite the cries to give officers the benefit of the doubt because of the innocent until proven principle,
77800,how the hell do you survive a gunshot to the face  that s some 50 cent shit,
77801,this thread https  wwwredditcomraskredditcomments460zpfwithout_insulting_anyone_what_would_you_say_tod01ln3,
77802,it s about damn time we made sure innocent good people had guns and training and could defend themselves   or we could stop giving guns to everybody gee i do nt know,
77803,maybe the cop was making furtive movements,
77806,cant ever trust cops you cant tell me that no one in the police dept knew this was happening they are all a bunch of child molesting bullies and there should be a reform on the police system in america  the government uses chemtrails to numb us to the police brutality that happens infront of us  every day  and soon we will be living in a facist policestate society controlled by the good ol boys club  if we dont elect jill stein this year  extend the presidential term limits and gxd bless america    edit      oops  i thought it said  sherrif man    point still stands though,
77808, bundy allegedly does nt vaccinate or treat his cattle for disease and does nt employ cowboys to herd them  so he  has to bait them into traps in order to gather them   prosecutors said  wtf  he has to bait and trap his cattle  is this guy for real,4
77812,just in time for the marijuana legalization bill this november,7
77813,arizona   republican   legislators want to subvert the will of the people ftf,7
77814,sounds reasonable to me  more easily  is such a loaded headline current law states ballot measures need 34th of both chambers of legislature to overturn ballot measures no matter how narrowly they pass mesnard wants to amend the law so that the amount needed to overturn is proportional to the margin the measure passed  people want to sit here and think this is some republican ploy on the grounds of marijuana measures  but what happens if some sleazy right wing john kavanagh inspired measure gets through at 51   there are certainly 15 az senators who ll support it and thus it ca nt be changed  this bill gives parity to both sides of the aisle,
77816,interesting though   since 2005  texas has prosecuted 38 juveniles for intoxication manslaughter or intoxication assault only three were sent to the adult system  and half of all cases resulted in probation of some kind  i think this is more telling of the justice system  and accessibility to competent  quality counsel it s clear money buys better legal counsel  but if the government subsidized public defense more heavily  the outcomes would clearly be different,9
77817,cash is king in the world of corruption,9
77818,i said this somwhere else  but it s also pertinent here  everyone is equal under the law and money is how we measure that equality,9
77819,the difference  money,9
77820,it s almost like the rich live under different rules,8
77821,this is standard practice in the us judicial system outcomes will vary from case to case depending on financial status there s actually a legal term for it  it s called   cream ,9
77822,my mom has always said guilty until proven rich,8
77823,i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law this is the american dream,8
77824,and liberty and justice for all  who can afford it ,5
77825,i love how this article just glosses over the fact that arellano had previous dui convictions which is why he did nt receive the same sentence  this was couch s first dui case which is why he got probation  as texas takes the rehab route  but whatever lets rage and ignore the fact,8
77826,is everyone here honestly  seriously shocked that money gets you out of trouble  am i taking crazy pills,5
77827,going beyond the dae legal system is corrupt  circlejerk in this thread  there are certainly some differences in these cases firstly  the arellano case  the other one in the article  happened in 2007  six years before couch s trial likewise  the article says that arellano had driven while intoxicated and drank underage before  which means that he would ve had a greater chance of being moved to an adult trial meanwhile  couch had no prior violations of the law  meaning that he could nt be moved to an adult court,6
77828,i understand what you are trying to do with your anecdotal case comparisons however  they are nt comparable cases when you consider all the factors  including criminal history  but  even if you ignore all the other factors  i know of a white 20 yo male from a fairly wealthy family in my area who was sent to prison for a year based on a drunk driving accident so my anecdotal evidence shows similar punishment to your anecdotal case thereby anecdotally refuting your point,8
77829,the real crime here those eyebrow,6
77830,gee  it s almost like different judges and prosecutors in different areas with separate cases can lead to different verdicts or something,6
77831,that s why the case became famous because he got away while guilty that was autocorrect capitalization,4
77832,affluenza is just a fake term that means the following  if you are rich  you do nt go to jail if you are not  you will spend 10 years like 95  of americans,4
77833,let s be clear what happened to the poor kid was what s supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone you fucking go to prison couch was the exception,7
77834,he did nt go free he was on probation and then he violated that  so he s going to jail,8
77835,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,3
77836,if someone is brought up too rich to not know the difference between right and wrong  why can the same argument not be used for poor people who commit crimes  people who are brought up in poverty do nt really know right from wrong just as much as a kid who has rich parents,3
77837,that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time,3
77838,  sees title   probably not a rich white kid   clicks article   and yuuuuuuuuuup sm,3
77839,prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win,3
77840,obviously as white god intended,4
77841,i fucking hate ethan couch  i mean look at that look on his face disgusting i mean even his name is stupid,5
77842,horrible headline  38 cases of dui manslaughter in texas since 2005 and only 3 of them went to adult court  that tells you the vast majority of these cases are handled with kid glovesso picking out one of 3 that went the other route and comparing it to the affluenza case is disingenuous  but fuck it  that is what the media does today god forbid they instead do an article focusing on how in texas if you are a drunk driving kid that kills people you will get away with it 35 out of 38 time,4
77843,it did nt seem to mention how they had the same judge  we ve already established this same judge would have been open to giving a similar sentence to a poor minority because she tried to do just that keep making this a race issue  though lord knows the media loves to stir up ignorant poor folks  also  anyone who comes to the us illegally and kills is citizens deserves little sympathy he was a juvenile  so it would be appropriate to release him and deport him  i do nt understand the need to distort issues to make tbem about race we already have enough problems it s already an established fact that those with the means to afford a lawyer fair better than those who do nt,3
77844,the difference  money,1
77845,did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window,1
77846,by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time,1
77847,excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did,1
77848,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,1
77849,lemmeguess ethnic  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they re ethnic,1
77850,cash rules everything around me they have  and very good lawyers,1
77851,well  on one hand you have a kid that killed 3 adults and a child in a crash  and on the other a kid who killed a mother and her  unborn child  in a crash in a conservative state so he could have mowed down 10 born people and probably got less than what he gets for  accidentally  killing 1 unborn baby,1
77852,free public defender vs 2000  an hour lawyer,1
77853,this affluenza thing still baffles me  doing bad things because money  with that sort of logic hobos must be saints and not the crack heads living under bridges,1
77854,no shit  i mean was nt the entire outrage that similar cases normally lead to prison in the first place,1
77855,seriously  the rich kid,1
77856,that s what  affluenza  means literally the entire point of this case and why it s been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich,1
77857,i say it like my grandma used to  money talks  bullshit walks,1
77858,he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows wtf,1
77859,there s actually a legal question that you asked,1
77860,you do nt automatically get a dui in fact,1
77861,biggest problem in the universe  vote it up  http  thebiggestproblemintheuniversecomepisode8,1
77864, link to published journal article in nature   http  wwwnaturecomnbtjournalvaopncurrentfullnbt3413html  from the abstract  gt  we demonstrate capabilities of the itop by fabricating mandible and calvarial bone  cartilage and skeletal muscle future development of the itop is being directed to the production of tissues for human applications and to the building of more complex tissues and solid organs  amazing development and could be huge for transplants and the like op s article states  gt  when researchers implanted itopgenerated bone  muscle  and cartilage into rats and mice  the printed materials developed blood supplies and internal structures resembling those of natural tissue  according to the article  they created a lifelike human ear cool stuff,1
77866,they can still go to the doctor and get the scans on their ow,1
77868,i have my own super secret private social network site that only i know about,6
77869,so  i read the article and it appears the site was not created by anonymous but anonymous advocates the site  i believe facebook could use some healthy competition  though i question how private anyone s information can be on the internet  even with encryption it seems no matter how much you try to protect someone s information online  there is always someone who  with enough time and ingenuity  can obtain it,5
77870,anyone else get the feeling this was an ad,4
77871, doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  i have watched criminal minds penelope can do it,6
77872,given the propensity of anonymous for leaking confidential and private information of people who do nt share their viewpoints  i do nt know how super private it would stay if someone expressed a contrary opinion would my belief that kanye is an immature narcissist result in release of the name and location of my virginity loss  or my 2nd grade teacher  btw  not the same person ,6
77873,i bet tom from facebook is already a membe,3
77874,gt  but unlike its competitors it doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  so how does it make money to pay for development  management  support  bandwidth  and servers  i do nt know how this shit gets reported slow news day  remember that stupid  social network  diaspora  they got global coverage about their facebook alternative i do nt think they ever even finished the product  let alone had anyone use it  must be built by the son of some important news editor who can drum up publicity this is likely the same,3
77875,so if i log into reddit on the tor network and my verification email account  if i were to use one  was anonymous  would nt that be the same thing,3
77876,facebook s shills are working overtime in this posts comments i hope this social media site becomes a viable alternative,3
77877,private social media pick one,1
77878,i love when people treat shit like this like news downvote it to where it belongs,
77879,eh  with anonymous s history of doxxing people  i rather not use anything that they have a hand i,
77880,so some social dropout  400 lb teenage hackers are going to be watching over other the private data of other people  i do nt think the anonymous group realizes how much they are despised across the internet,
77881,i would trust this site over facebook,
77883,well  that ought to take care of the problem,1
77884,i like that guy after all  i would only do it for the money with minimal violence  and would never want to kill people so  if i ever decide to go and work for a cartel  i m  definitely  working for el jesus,1
77885,is he hiring mercenaries  or he has enough already  it s also not a problem to join any military  as they re all doing god s work,1
77886,well  if their since could nt be instantly forgiven  that might have had weight,1
77887,clearly  jesus would prefer that you support the child rape industrial complex because that s how he rolls,1
77888,jesus the auto repairman,1
77890,has nt he already had  like  two years to prevent this in the first place,7
77891,lansing has actually dealt with this problem and their civil engineers have a solution which is both fast and more costeffective than traditional measures they connect the end of the new pipe to the old pipes so when they pull out the old pipe they simultaneously thread the new pipes into the existing space this speeds up the process and the people in lansing estimate with adequate training  involving them with the process in flint  and hiring enough crews it can be completed for flint in one year,7
77892,this whole situation is a national embarrassment  and it makes my blood boil  but what does naacp have to do with city water  is it a race issue as well  i ve never seen the demographics on flint  come to think of it  maybe aspca should get involved  too i bet people are still feeding their pets city water no matter what  edit  i just think it should be about officials   doing their fucking jobs    framing it as a race issue might just come back to bite us  who knows how many towns are discreetly checking for  and finding  elevated lead  should it matter how many african americans live there  if so  how should officials proceed differently  will it result in a process of public relations triage  that prioritizes black communities  public officials just need to do their fucking jobs for the public they serve there s no need to complicate this with race,5
77893,that s like threatening to get one of those online white house petitions going it does nt matter,1
77894,fix flint s water pipes or they ll burn flint to the ground,3
77895,i m all for getting this fixed as quickly as possible but i also do nt want something rushed either figure it out figure it out right,1
77896,okayand then what  all of the protesting has nt done jack so far what s one more protest going to do  it s not going to make the state government move any faster  it s very clear that the government  at every level  is more concerned about covering itself a protest is nt going to change that,
77897,sooooo glad i do nt live in flint  that place sounds like a complete disaster,
77898,who the fuck are they to demand this  are whiteasianlatino people not allowed to be affected by this,
77901,gt  barbins has been charged with  displaying obscene matter to a minor  and child pornography  police say  sounds like a molestation charge is soon to follo,3
77902,when asked why he did it mr barbins replied   i thought it was ok  this is a catholic school  fwiw i do nt know if the school is affiliated with the holy c or the founders simply had a hardon for mother mary,1
77903,i wonder how reddit is going to try to defend  this  pedophile,
77905,i believe this is constitutional and on a case by case basis i am ok with thisand to have full call or text records released from the carrier this is why we have court ordersbut carte blanche any time access  no  that is unacceptable,5
77906,they can helpsorry  it did nt work,1
77908,in this case  i hope what happens in vegas stays in vegas,7
77909,man  if this was the best the americans could offer for rebellion  we might as well embrace fascism the government is far smarter than these guys  guy loses both his kids  and freaks out  leaves  petoria   http  familyguywikiacomwikipetoria   and gets popped is nt there a tvtropes page about this,1
77910,all the air out of the takeover lol,4
77911,lock him in prison for a long time,1
77912,yes  let him wait for trial on his ranch that will definitely work out well,
77914,i hope they left quietly after looking in the window  they might enjoy this over at rwalkingdea,4
77915,pfft  what  really  happened was that the onduty cops did nt have cable at their station so they watched it through the windows,4
77916,we also fire up the surround sound amp when the walking dead comes on  but we do nt keep any windows open i wonder if the propane bomb scene is what triggered the 911 cal,4
77917, a show about firearms  more like a show about a group of survivors of a zombie apocalypse but whatever,4
77918, it was the tee vee  i m sorry it disturrrbed you now it s rather late   nurse diese,1
77919,is nt it heartwarming how tv can still bring the whole family together,1
77921,so not only are these disputed  there are now long term  long range weapons on them,1
77923,gt  gt  johnson says the man s family will be shown body camera footage of the incident before it s released publicly  well  that s an improvement,6
77924,personally working as security guard in a hospital  and having to deal with people who have mental health issues its not fun  or safe and generally the actual hospital staff is nt very helpful i ve been kicked in the head  punched in the face  and many other things happen sometimes these people can not be handled and tazeing could deescalate the situation,4
77925,from what i ve read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops it looks like the taser use was justified sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca nt be deescalated otherwise  has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died,6
77926,this is unacceptable tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are nt,7
77927,he died 5 days later at a different hospital  clickbait headline i m sure we ll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death,6
77928,well at least the officers saved the victim from harming  himself ,1
77929,he died a week later he was also resisting arrest,3
77930,officers ca nt subdue people without shocking them to deathstun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only not some wack trying to get mental help,
77931,oh this is lame  his identity has not been released  nor the race of the officers   wtf does that have to do with anything  oh that s right more race bating by the media,1
77932,police are to trigger happy they could easily have uses theiroh,1
77933,the article states he was attacking staff and police using glass vials the police were not obliged to wrestle this violent person and risk getting stabbed by broken glass it s pretty simple  do nt violently attack innocent people and you wo nt be tased,
77934,police are not there  to protect and serve  you  edit   warren v district of columbia   https  enwikipediaorgwikiwarren_v_district_of_columbia  is just one example that downvoters should read,
77936,14 billion years    so what am i suppose to tell them when i get called in for a tax audit 15 billion years from now and my records only go back 14 billion years,7
77937,another  holographic storage  for us to hear about for 20 years that wo nt materialize in our lifetimes it s a bummer  removable archival media seems like it is really stagnant,6
77938,yes  but will there be a  reader  for that disc in 14 billion years,6
77939,i always love when brand new technologies claim forever,4
77940,cool  take all of humankind  audio  video and written text  and burn it to a couple of discs store several copies of it on the moon  along with a radio beacon should humanity get wiped out  we ll have left something for future generations to discover  no need to build giant pyramids,4

77948,from  government  s memorandum in support of its motion for pretrial detention   http  wwwscribdcomdoc29947153421616doc4usavclivenbundyusadetentionmemorandumforclivenbundy  gt  bundy is lawless and violent he does not recognize federal courts  claiming they are illegitimate  does not recognize federal law  refuses to obey federal court orders  has already used force and violence against federal law enforcement officers while they were enforcing federal court orders  nearly causing catastrophic loss of life or injury to others he has pledged to do so again in the future to keep federal law enforcement officers from enforcing the law against him as of the date of this hearing  he continues to violate federal court orders and continues to possess the proceeds of his illegal activities  gt  gt  bundy is currently charged with crimes of violence including using and brandishing firearms in connection with crimes of violence under title 18  united states code  section 924  c   as such  the bail reform act presumes that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that will ensure the safety of the community 18 usc  3142  e   3   b   here  no evidence has been adduced during the investigation of the instant charges that even remotely hints at a rebuttal to that presumption in fact  all the evidence suggests that bundy will continue to act lawlessly  will not abide by court orders  and will use violence to ensure that federal laws are not enforced as to him,8
77949, bundy asked for a courtappointed attorney at his first hearing last week  still living off govt handouts i see,8
77950,gt  bundy   his  attorney said  would go to court in nevada if ordered to do so   right  sure i mean  it s not like he s ever defied the government before  and he  totally  recognises it s legitimacy  gt  but judge stewart said if bundy was released   i  m guessing that  s the last we  ll ever see of mr bundy  a wise and perspicacious judge,9
77951, daughterinlaw briana bundy said tuesday that a federal judge in oregon should let the 69yearold live at home while he awaits trial  sure that s an excellent suggestion i would further suggest that the judge prepare a lunch of peanut butter sandwiches with home made raspberry jam and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies for mr bundy each day,8
77952,gt  the judge said bundy  69  is a flight risk and a danger to the community in the bail hearing tuesday afternoon in downtown portland i mean i ca nt really find a reason not to agree with that a 69 year old who does nt believe he s beholden to the law is as dangerous as a 29 year old who does nt believe he s beholden to the law,8
77953,they are just misunderstood they did this for free sex toys,7
77954,not sure he was the worst member of ya llquaida  http  mwashingtontimescomnews2014apr15formersheriffwillingletwifedaughterdiefron,6
77955,hope he gets the  negros  there to hear his theory or their culture and living style,1
77956,the man is a wellmeaning but ideologically obsessed idiot the government has handled this clusterfuck extremely well  and i am not one to say that lightly,6
77957,it s important for the government to provide a consistent and cohesive narrative if they are to help squash future acts of rebellion cliven bundy and his ilk are lawless  violent  redneck anarchists and none of the things they protested had any validity whatsoever,5
77958,good  this arrest and trial has been delayed for too long,7
77959,given his history  bundy is as dangerous as a monkey with a straightrazor,4
77960,where is the groundswell of the righteously indignant right wing militia that was supposed to come to his aid,1
77961,mmmmmm i need some of the bundy range fed beef i hope the feds seize it all soon and put it up for sale,1

77969,corruption of public officials in michigan  no way,9
77970,i certainly do nt necessarily agree with public funds being used for a sports stadium  and i definitely do nt agree with nepotism  but i think criticizing mike illitch somehow taking advantage of detroit is a shortsighted mistake had it not been for mr illitch pretty much singlehandily reinvesting in a city everyone wanted to leave behind over the last 20 years  the city would nt even be close to back on a path to relevancy  whether you want to believe it is or not   the other thing to consider is that this new complex not only brings commerce to an area that was a combination of blight and open fields  it also brings quite a few jobs to the city  as well as some stateoftheart buildings that will bring commerce and international travelers to the area for a variety of reasons  conferences  concerts  etc   this all equals more money for the city of detroit  which is why they re willing to make the investment in the first place   and another part of a blightfilled neighborhood updated and usable for the future  this is a sticky situation that reeks of an unfortunate quidproquo  but when it comes to what is good for the city of detroit  it s hard to argue that anyone has anything on the passion and dedication of mike illitch,9
77971,how in the fuck are there no comments about the red wings owner s hair  ,9
77972,everyone talks about the insanity in pro sports these days  yet no one mentions  public or private  universities  which are all nonprofit  spending massive amounts of their cash on stadiums  athletic facilities  etc it s the same thing if the universities are public  and its only marginally different if they re private the reason they have that money in the first place is federallysubsidized student loans,8
77973,lol illitch has done more for the city of detroit than any other person in the last 50 years fuck off,9
77974,so he did a good job for the team and the owner offered him more money for a better job  happens all the time  kids,6
77975,is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit  or ford field  most people would not step foot downtown if it was nt for those two places i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do nt bring forth revitalization like intendedbut the only article i ve read was about stadiums in la and sf,6
77976,before you jump on the  why ca nt detroit use the money for things that actually matter  train   here s   http  wwwcrainsdetroitcomarticle20140921news309219990oncostfinancingofwingsarenahereareanswers  an article outlining the finances of this massive project  edit  s  for those not wanting to click  gt  the initial base price is  450 million problems  changes and added amenities could increase that final cost anything beyond  450 million must be paid by the ilitches  gt  the michigan strategic fund will sell  450 million in two series of bonds they will be divided into  250 million in series a bonds that will be backed by property taxes already captured by the downtown development authority the  200 million in series b bonds will be backed by the  115 million olympia development has agreed to pay the dda for bond retirement  gt  the ilitches  through olympia  will pay  200 million of the bond debt detroit s dda  via its property tax capture ability  will pay back  250 million of the bonds new yorkbased merrill lynch  a division of bank of america  which has pledged to buy all the publicly backed series a bonds in the deal it will then sell the bonds to the public dallasbased comerica bank inc will buy the series b bonds backed by olympia s money the bank  formerly based in detroit  has the naming rights to comerica park  where the ilitchowned detroit tigers play comerica intends to keep the bonds on its books rather then sell them,8
77977, misleading title   https  wwwredditcomrhockeycomments45xs0mdetroit_contractor_who_negotiated_285_million_ind00vnke   it was state money  not detroit s also  ilitch footed most of the bill himself  or through his company   please research  the district  and see their plans for it before passing judgement,9
77978,clickbait no one around here is remotely upset about taxpayer funds going to a new stadium for the most popular team in town we re not really unhappy about the new development for business and residences that is happening and we re not raising any concerns about the effort to revitalize the city  detroit is climbing out of a hole created by the corruption of influential individuals local business and leaders have been more beneficial in this process than any other group and this stadium  and the district surrounding it are seen as victories in this effort,8
77979,ah  a local spin on the old  congressperson becomes lobbyist  setup,5
77980,they are literally building new district for the city not just an arena  a whole new district development is what the city needs and frankly  detroit politics have always been just a  wee  bit corrup,4
77981,but  guys  come on we need our circuses  what would we do with out national sports  concentrate on real issues  lol  that s no fun ,4
77982,at ohio state  the man whole negotiated the deal to sell its parking rights to a private company  campusparc  left to work for them after it was signed,4
77983,you think that s a wig,4
77984,public money should never be allowed to pay for sports teams unless the team has to pay back the city directly  with interest none of this but businesses will benefit  bullsht it s my fucking money you re stealing  i do nt want to  potentially  subsidize businesses downtown,8
77985,if you re a bernie supporter  who thinks a public funded  1 trillion dollar infrastructure package is a good deal because jobs  but is outraged by the state of michigan investing  285 million in the renovationrevitalization of its  largest city  then you might want to reexamine one of those positions,6
77986,for all the people complaining about spending the money on the new stadium and  less mentioned  surrounding developments  all i can say is it will be more than worth it if it fixes up that area governments of all levels have been dumping money into the cass corridor since the early days of johnson s great society programs with any luck this will finally be a solution that stick,7
77987,itt  out of staters have no fucking idea about the current state of economics in detroit and how great this project is going to be for the city  i do nt even know where to begin with this article it s clear the author did nt talk to a single person in the city or state or even try to get a feel for the public opinion on the topic including garbage clickbait phrases like the previous article titled  detroit scam city  how the red wings took hockeytown for all it had  has to be one of the dumbest fucking things i ve ever read  when detroit was at its absolute rock bottom worst  going to joe louis arena was probably the only reason suburban white people would ever go into the city and spend money now mike ilitch wants to build a gigantic urban development project including restaurants  shopping stores    apartment complexes   and oh yeah a brand new stateoftheart arena for one of the most successful hockey teams of all time  they have nt missed the playoffs since before i was born  25 years ago they are a big deal and have been for decades   oh  and it s being built at the exact time there s an influx of young people and new businesses into the the city which will create more upward momentum  yes  the city is helping pay for it the city also got a lot of input on it design  layout  and what additional projects would be built along with the arena this happens in every single city an arenastadium is built i do nt necessarily think that s how it should work but the fact of the matter is that this is how these deals are made and the city absolutely needs projects like this if it wants to continue on its upward trend  also attacks on mike ilitch in this article and this thread are disgusting illitch has been a controversial figure for a long time but his story is like example of the american dream you d see in fiction his parents were poor immigrants  he grew up in detroit joined the marines played minor league baseball for the team he now owns opens up a mom and pop pizza place and creates an empire out of it  gets rich while creating jobs and doing public works projects for the city he grew up in even though it s a complete shit hole mike ilitch has been spending  and yes  making  money in detroit for years mike ilitch was there in the 90 s and early 00 s before there was ever a housing crash in the rest of the country the man is nt a saint but if it were nt for him there would be a lot less charities and projects being invested in now he wants to build a project the city desperately needs with the city s help and input  and he s getting shit on by some dumb ass  journalist  that ca nt get their facts straight  endran,7
77988,someone call charlie leduff,5
77989,good old cronyism at its finest  nothing new to detroit at all,5
77990,i wonder if journalists really think this is breaking news,3

77992,a city official operating at a congressional level,3
77993,gt  detroit contractor who negotiated  285 million in public money for the red wings now works with red wings owner so  i love how these headlines are supposed to make us feel outraged,4
77994,same shit happened here in richardson  texas  a suburb of dallas   the mayor brought in a huge company to the city and then left office to get a job with that same company it also turns out she was having an affair with a guy from that company too,3
77995,stop giving public money let business deal with business  not government  which can only be scammed and lead to corruption and bloated monopolies promote free market  and separation of power,3
77996,to be fair  he was working with him then too,1
77997,i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him,1
77998,conflict of interests everywhere,1
77999,this is how it worksthere is nt anything new to this story that is nt happening in nearly every major city and state across the country  i do nt like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it,1
78000,public money  om,1
78001,wow  you mean so someone who worked very closely with an organization and built relationships decided to work for said company later on in their career  shocking  i tell you,1
78002,everyone from the owners to the safety and comfort of the city and everyone thinks this whole plan is going to a country that did not mainly speak my language  i would learn it,1
78003,what a shocking surprise,1
78004,well that s convenien,1
78005,in other news  bears do  it turns out  shit in the woods,1
78006,can we just start an embarrass the fuck out of these greedy punks campaign,1
78010,i ve never heard of court on a saturday thats pretty crazy,9
78011,the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though,9
78012,it should be interesting to see how she s ruled in cases of dui in the past,9
78013,she refused a breathalyzer meh she ll beat thi,9
78014,would nt being drunk compromise her ability to judge  how many times has she been impaired while working  should nt anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least  what should i make for dinner,9
78015,offitherrrr i am the la,9
78016,no one has mentioned this yet but she got pulled over at 8 am drinking in the morning  this judge has some problems,9
78017,rochesterian here the article failed to mention that she was also driving with 2 flat tires for who knows how long,8
78018,in fairness  if i was a judge in rochester i d need a few drinks before work too,9
78019,i drove through rochester today  has anyone ever heard of a garbage plate,9

78022,that would suck to have your case decided by a slurring women,9
78023,if i know new york this should be a nasty slap on this wrist especially for those in powerful position,7
78024,what seems to be the officer  problem,6
78025,well who s gon na judge the case now,5
78026,her judgement was impaire,6
78027,fry needs to weigh in here  http  imgurcomgvji0u,6
78028,to be clear  the fact that she refused a breathalyzer is important in many states it is treated as evidence of impairment and justification for arrest she knew that i have many friends who are criminal defense attorneys and all have told me they advise to refuse breathalyzer always  unless there is a court order  i m not familiar with ny law  but i can pretty much guarantee she will not be convicted of dui if middle classcollege kids can get out of them  a federal judge surely can since it said nothing about a field sobriety test  i assume they either did nt administer one  or they did and she did not meet criteria for impairment,5
78029,my friends mom is a judge and that lady boozes super hard and will drive her car around i have seen her come home from the bar completely in ruins at least a dozen times over the last 10 years she is fearless  we live in a small town in wisconsin with a huge police presence she knows all the officers and has never had an issue the whole situation seems completely ridiculous she gives out sentences for dui all day and then drives drunk all night oh god  the hypocrisy,5
78030,ny state troopers only care about the star program more tixarrest  promotionmoney so if they could get points on there own mother they would,5
78031,i m just amazed that our local news channel in lafayette is on the front page of reddit x,5
78032,regardless of judge plates  why shouldare judges treated any differently  if i expect to get pulled over and ticketed for 5mph over i believe a judge should too especially since they make 15 times the income,5
78033,i feel like poor judgement like this should make you not a judge anymore,4
78034,oh they decided the law applies today,5
78035,many  if not most  political figures are serious alcoholics when you combine the constant parties and  fundraisers  that they are expected to attend with the stress of the job  a lot of them end up drinking a lot,8

78039,i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic,9
78040,for those unaware  he is one of the marines who carried sgt major kasal out of the fallujah  hellhouse  it is  in my opinion  one of the most iconic photos of the iraq war this photo  https  iimgurcomtezsn9zjp,9

78045,not only did they assault a veteran with a deadly weapon  they used his credit cards at locations should nt be too tough to find them fuck these kids,8
78046,this is a pretty typical mugging the mugger aggressively asks you a question  and regardless of your answer they either beat you or ask for money sometimes it s shit like  do you care about the homeless   and if you say  yes  then they aggressively ask for money and if you say no they get upset and threaten you and say you are a liar if you say no  they threaten to beat you or they just get violent either way  you are going to end up giving them your walletmoney another common one is asking you for a cigarette if you do nt have any  they will accuse you of having one and not giving it to them because of some stupid reason  racism  greed  etc  and then get aggressive and demand money for a pack of cigarettes whenif you pull out your wallet they will just grab it and walk away or beat you and run  i was on a bus and had a guy ask for my cell phone to make a call  when i said no  he said i was a racist because i assumed he was going to steal it made a big scene and stood up and got in my face and started slapping my head until i gave him the phone then he got off the bus  same principle with this happens all the fucking time if they get caught they usually say shit like  oh he gave it to me  i did nt steal it  scumbags only reason this one made the news is because it was a war vet,9
78047,pieces of shit who ve done nothing but take from societ,8

78049,from the daily caller article  gt   i believe this was a hate crime and i was targeted because of my skin color   marquez told the dcnf  too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the main stream media refuses to report on it  woah there racist  only black people can be the victim of a hate crime  now take your beating and shut the hell up about these underprivileged disadvantaged teen youths,8
78050,i m sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case,8
78051,lock these shitheads up and throw away the ke,8
78052,black lives do matter these teens  lives  however do not,9
78053,every fucking time a cop shoots a black guy  justified or not  we have people like obama telling us we have to do some  soul searching  and when cities like dc and baltimore  i live around both and can personally attest that shit like this happens all the time and is usually never reported  and detroit and new york and such have this shit happen  it s a non issue  fuck all of it  trump 201,8
78054,do white lives matter to blacks,6
78055,i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold  it s really political blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims  and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws  and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm  how much power do the sjws really have  will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution,8
78056,and people try to tell me that what celebrities do and say is not important at all on some level  in some instances it is  this is the movement beyonc  tried to shove into everyone s face at the superbowl just remember that,8
78057,best optionavoid dc because it s a shit hole,7
78058, across the street from the fbi headquarters,6
78059, do black lives matter if you do nt agree we ll beat and rob you   and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement,8
78060,i would like to remind everyone that bernie sanders has aligned himself with and defended the black lives matter movement in many of his speeches he talks about sandra bland  michael brown  eric garner and in typical fashion blames racism and the white establishment sanders never once mentions the blacks that are home invading in indianapolis  kansas city  atlanta  etc he never once talks about the blacks that have shot at and killed police  most recently a 19 year old black man shoots an officer in mississippi black lives matter and politicians like sanders are waging that the future will be less white and in that future you folks can imagine who will be the most vile and racist  edit  from today  white house tweets shoutout to grammy winner of best rap album  still no word on recent spate of cop killing,9
78061,let s see if this gets labeled as the hate crime it very clearly is  who am i kidding  that wo nt happen,8

78074,gt  luckie  s new role will entail working with media organizations  as well as government organizations  to understand how they  re currently using reddit and what their needs are from the platform  luckie told me he  ll then take that feedback and build it into reddit  s product  with the goal of making reddit more accessible to a broader community of people  so reddit will listen to what they like and dislike and then hand feed us whaat they want us to hear no longer will it be us posting what we find interesting and up or down voting it for exposure as much as it is meant to be  that s what i am hearing just another nail,9
78075,gt  the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do nt we have that subreddit already ,8

78090,great  a news manager  amp  head of journalism  with the attention span of one sentence  and the intellectual depth of a drunk on a 24 hour train ride  note  reddit is a whore for anything that emanates out of the roman catholic ponzi generating pope s pie hole perhaps the new head of journalism  could find another criminal organization to support on reddit instead of the catholic church criminal empire,

78117,so this guy is innocent until proven guilty right  why is this investigation so short  we do nt know the details  why does it take a year to investigate an officer for shooting someone  and this takes a couple of days to charge this guy  is that disconnect enough to make anyone here question things enough to accept that there is a massive encompassing problem with our legal system  i always have to wonder because we see many of the same people calling for people to wait for details after an officer shoots someone  telling us not to be monday morning quarterbacks then stories like this pop up and we have those same people frothing at the mouth in this situation where it has nt been given the year plus of investigation that an officer who shoots someone would be given the guy is already guilty despite the cries to give officers the benefit of the doubt because of the innocent until proven principle,

78124,gt  reached for comment on saturday  a highway patrol official said the motorcycle driver who was leading the procession was pulled over after attempting to halt traffic in the no 5 lane so that the motorcade could pass  gt  gt  although the officer initiated the traffic stop on the lead vehicle only  and indicated to other members of the procession that they could continue on  some of them chose to pull over as well  said sgt jose nunez  a chp spokesman  gt  gt  the motorcycle driver was cited for illegal lighting  and his vehicle was impounded because his driver s license was not current  according to nunez    gt   it exceeds the bounds of all human decency   said family attorney edward ramsey  an officer has the discretion to stop or not stop a funeral procession if it was me  i would have probably escorted this procession to the burial  he did nt stop the funeral procession  all he did was stop the unlicensed driver that was breaking the la,6

78129,the entitlement attitude of so many americans  gt  if it was me  i would have probably escorted this procession to the burial  your funeral escort was driving without a valid license the chp was correct to pull him over and cite him the rest of the funeral procession was free to continue on but you chose to pull over instead that was your own decision that caused you to be late the funeral  what is so aggravating to me about this is the family will file a lawsuit and probably win they will get to think they are right but they will milk the taxpayers of thousands of dollars,1

78153,fry needs to weigh in here  http  imgurcomgvji0u,6
78154,to be clear  the fact that she refused a breathalyzer is important in many states it is treated as evidence of impairment and justification for arrest she knew that i have many friends who are criminal defense attorneys and all have told me they advise to refuse breathalyzer always  unless there is a court order  i m not familiar with ny law  but i can pretty much guarantee she will not be convicted of dui if middle classcollege kids can get out of them  a federal judge surely can since it said nothing about a field sobriety test  i assume they either did nt administer one  or they did and she did not meet criteria for impairment,5

78231,for those of you incapable of rtfa before making racist comments  the bride and groom are actors hired by a charity to raise awareness and the 37000day statistic refers to child marriages estimated worldwide not specifically in this local area,9
78232,gt  nearly 15 million girls  some as young as eight or nine so  some as young as eight,9
78233,37000 child marriages every day  if that s the case why are these people shocked  surely they must see these pedo photoshoots on the reg,9
78234,these statistics seem unreliable estimated 12 billion new child marriages by 2050  even taking the 37000 a day estimate at face value that would only get you to 500 million by 2050  i mean seriously  assuming population growth rates remain unchanged  unlikely as the rate is slowing significantly  there will only be  47 billion women born under the age of 8 by 2050 is it truly believable that a quarter of women born in the next 34 years are going to be placed into a child marriage,8

78242,eh personally i m more concerned with men sitting with their legs spread on public transportation that s the real problem,1
78243,at that rate the entire female population of the us would be married off in 11 years certainly 37000 child marriages a day is unsustainable or maybe it s media hype,1

78259,colleges really need to stop expelling students due to these kangaroo courts  i m fine with them if it s from breaking a school infraction like alcohol on a dry campus or something of that sort but  if a student is accused of a criminal offense  let the courts deal with it and decide from there  schools are nt equipped to deal with these kinds of cases  nor should they be expected to be these are lifechanging accusations and need to be treated as such  for the benefit of both parties involved,9
78260,gt  ut investigators later decided  that the evidence supported a finding that  he  had sexually assaulted ms roe  the opposite of the conclusion reached by the more experienced detectives of the police department   the lawsuit says the dean of students then recommended he be expelled  ah but the police are looking for evidence that he did it  college tribunals assume he did and require he provide evidence that he did nt  which  typically  the accused is not allowed to present,9
78261,gt  one plaintiff is a 24yearold recent graduate  the other is a 21yearold student who is one semester away from graduating with a bachelor  s degree in physics  their lawsuits say   in the graduate  s case  he faces being banned from any ut system campus  being denied a shot at a ut graduate degree and having a notation put on his transcript   the undergrad faces expulsion in addition to the same punishments  that does nt make any sense to me why would an institution retroactively amend the transcript of someone  who already graduated  to say this person violated school policy  after graduating   this seems to be more evidence that they re trying to scapegoat the plaintiffs here i mean  if they were concerned with the alleged victim s wellbeing more than trying to look  tough on sexual assault   what is the point of amending the transcript,9
78262,who s the idiot who decided that kangaroo courts were a good idea,9
78263,are we to the point where  sexual assaultrape  almost no longer have a meaning    you getting hammered and hooking up with a hammered guy is not rape  nor is it assault he should sue her for the exact same thing,8
78264,i once saw a swedish movie called ondskan   evil  that drove me to become a lawyer today  here  https  enwikipediaorgwikievil_  2003_film   plot one of the key issues that caught my attention in this movie is the disregard of the law the school had to the protagonist s rights when he hired a lawyer  because of some grievance he had with the school  it backed off immediatly when the lawyer lay down the letter of the law to the headmaster of that educational institution in front of all his guests  in this university of texas sexual assault case  i believe imhlo  l is for legal   that the constitution sets a foundation of rules for everyone inside it s jurisdiction  and no internal policy that ut may have can go against the rules set by the us constitution everyone should enjoy the right of being innocent until proven guilty  and time and time again people are being layed off their jobs  students expelled  lives ruined because of yettobeproven  accusations  the right thing that any institution  like ut  should always do is address all cases of criminal behavior by always recognizing first the accused innocence until proven guilty in a court of law  edit  grammar,8
78265,gt  the friend said she thought the woman was conscious because  when she saw her kissing this man  she was awake and talking  the lawsuit says  so intentionally or not the woman who claimed to be assaulted is not telling the truth  editand they decided to expel him without even talking to the student his first chance to give his side was an appeal for his expulsion this is a fucking kangaroo court  edit2  the second lawsuit claims expulsion against a student was recommended without the alleged victim ever personally making a sex assault accusation  http  kxancom20160205lawsuitsagainstutallegebiasagainstmalesinsexassaultcase,9
78266,gt  the undergrad  s lawsuit says he had sex with a woman who was not a ut student after leaving a house party near campus sometime after midnight on march 6  2015 about a month later  the woman  s father called ut police and accused the man of sexually assaulting his daughter  fuck this i understand that if a woman is  actually  rapedmolestedassaulted it could be hard to come forward  but waiting a month or longer and  then  reporting it is bullshit you get raped  you report it immediately the longer you wait  the more i m going to doubt your accusation,7
78267,gt  university police never spoke to the woman the undergrad was accused of assaulting and no criminal charges were ever pursued  his lawsuit says the father  s report was referred to the ut dean of students  okay what the hell  seriously  though its this sort of thing that makes me really hate schools handling sexual assault cases on their own the police did nt even talk to the accused victim  but decided to tell the dean instead  it feels like it happens all the time when we have these alternate systems of punishment we stop treating crimes like crimes and treat them like rule infractions a rule infraction is cheating on a test an alleged assault is a crime treat it like one,7
78268,eli5 kangaroo courts thanks,8
78269,activist administrators  check lack of due process  check prohibited from legal council or cross examination of the accuser  check nothin to see here  move along people,6
78270,well  they are probably right these school kangaroo courts have demonstrated they have no respect for the privacy and rights of the accused  and are only interested in demonstrating how seriously they take sexual assault accusations,6

78275,it seems to me that a public institution has to follow the sixth amendment  which grants  the right to a public trial without unnecessary delay  the right to a lawyer  the right to an impartial jury  and the right to know who your accusers are and the nature of the charges and evidence against you,6
78276,jane roe because jane doe would be incest,4
78277,so these students that are expelled do they have to still pay back their loans even though they do nt get a degree now and can they carry their credits over to another school or are they now worthless,5
78278,i love how at the end she implies that if there were a person punching people randomly on campus they would choose to not involve the police presumably so that the assault victims could  control their own destiny,3
78279,30 year old here  and planning on returning to school with all this insanity about social values exploding everywhere  i may just hold off a few more years and wait for school to become a profitable idea again,3
78280,gt  the university has been placed under enormous political pressure to appear tough on those accused of sexual assault  there s your problem right there how about be tough on those convicted of sexual assault and those whom the law decides are innocent be treated as such,3
78281,umso expel the drunken slut too  right  i could get behind that they both got drunk and made bad choices that reflect poorly on the school kick em both out  why only the male  did he conspire in some way to get her drunk  if they re both adults that got drunk and fucked then they re both equally guilty,7
78282,considering that almost every case of a rape accusation that s come out massively public has been shown to be fraudulent  i m reserving judgement on this one,3
78283, ut investigates more than 100 allegations of sexual assault a year  and that number is growing  liebman said   how the hell are there hundreds of allegations a year that s insane this reminds me of the play the crucible  i saw you with the devilcommunistscapitalists  homo raptorus,1
78284,damned if you do damned if you dont,1
78285,seems like the girl was so hammered that she could nt remember the sex figured it would be less shameful if she accused him of assault,1
78288,cant ever trust cops you cant tell me that no one in the police dept knew this was happening they are all a bunch of child molesting bullies and there should be a reform on the police system in america  the government uses chemtrails to numb us to the police brutality that happens infront of us  every day  and soon we will be living in a facist policestate society controlled by the good ol boys club  if we dont elect jill stein this year  extend the presidential term limits and gxd bless america    edit      oops  i thought it said  sherrif man    point still stands though,
78290,if the proposal came from a doctor or scientist  i would be 100  on the side of this bill but it comes from a senator  which makes me want to question it  scientific papers require peer review from the most qualified people to call bullshit on an idea before you can get it published as legitimate i m not saying i m questioning the idea  but i do nt know enough about the process of bills and laws to give it my automatic seal of approval  i think it s a good idea to administer anesthesia to an unborn human that can feel pain whether or not it increases the cost of abortion but the cost is still a talking point all i can do is hope that the people in charge of the decision in the end have the same concerns that i do,8
78291,i mean  we already use anesthesia on fetuses when performing surgery in the womb for exactly this reason  so it s hardly surprising  http  wwwdoctorsonfetalpaincomfetalpaintheevidence5documentatio,7
78292,wether a fetus is under anesthesia is completely dependent on the type of anesthetic being performed any general anesthetic also anesthetizes the fetus while other types like spinal or local do not even then  there is no accurate way to quantify or measure awareness in fetuses  much less adults undergoing anesthesia the body also still responds to pain under anesthesia  as its an autonomic response  so the definition of  feeling pain  is not something that should be measured i feel like awareness  which is impossible to measure in a fetus regardless  is a real idicator of humanity an easy solution would be to simply do all elective abortions under general anesthesia  which may cost more  but is easily doable i have no idea what the preferred method of anesthesia is  if any  for elective abortions  source  i do anesthesia in a catholic hospital,5
78293,i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them,7
78294,they have nt decided at what point of gestation this would happen  gt  montana lawmakers passed a similar law in 2015 requiring fetal anesthesia before surgeries  including abortion  after 20 or more gestational weeks  so  4 months the general consensus for viability outside the womb is around 6 monthsish for some the concept of consciousness coincides with viability outside the womb,6
78295, this is a review on fetal pain   http  jamajamanetworkcomarticleaspx  articleid  201429amp  resultclick  1  from clinical review  although it is 10 years old it says  gt  evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques similarly  limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion,5
78296,is nt this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor s office  would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder,5
78297,ignorant people propose bill based on said ignorance,
78298,i m going to talk about this as delicately as possible i  genuinely  want thoughts and opinions on this subject  i am asking that no one become immediately offended by what i m about to say rather than respond with your opinion telling me why you believe that my view should change i am childfree i do nt want kids  i m 35  so it s pretty much set in stone at this juncture in my life i do nt see myself as a prolife or prochoice supporter and the reason for that is because i kind of agree with both sides on one hand i firmly believe that the destruction of a human being  born or not  is murder it fits the definition  of  murder before you downvote me into oblivion  let me be clear it s not the votes i care about it s that you understand where i m coming from even though i have that belief  i also believe that some people were just not meant to be children but therein lies another debate  why do nt they place it in adoption  because most of the time unwanted children are kept  they re not placed into adoption and when they re kept their chances of being neglected as children  whether it be mentally  emotionally  or physically  rise exponentially i certainly would nt want to have a child and resent it i  do nt  have children because frankly i m mean as a damn snake i do nt see any part of me that could ever have a child and not lose my temper with it and i would nt put a kid through that  because  i  was put through that i would be a horrible parent  anyway  i have a point i swear if you re going to have an abortion  why anesthetize it first  do i believe that it can feel  absolutely  but you re killing it i mean it s not like you re putting it to sleep and saying   here  fight for your life  you re fucking killing it so why have a crisis of conscience about it  again  i m sorry if i offend anyone  that s not my intention i m just a realistic person and it is what it is sugarcoating it does nt change it the bill seems like a waste of time and tax dollars  edit  i do nt understand why this is being downvoted so  please  give me your views instead of leaving me wondering because if there s something i m not understanding it needs to be made clear again this is absolutely not about the votes rather than having a discussion,
78299,if you pinch a fetus it will cry so that pretty much proves they feel pai,
78300,because that makes it okay  smh,
78303,fucking sad how this was nt described as an act of terrorism i guess that title is reserved for nonchristians,9
78304,it is sad that it closed even for a short time people like fiorina do nt give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time,8
78305,definitely not terrorism though  just a little rampage  you know he was probably having a bad day or something,8

78314,so  someone went on a shooting rampage and killed people in order to stop planned parenthood from killing people  but now planned parenthood is open again  and proudly killing people  well  i am glad that worked out the entire thing makes tons of sense,
78315,pp is where there is regular deadly rampages against unborn babies,
78316,planned parenthood is basically condoms and the oklahoma city bombing,
78319,the majority of colorado is not going to be happy about this,3
78320,reasonable safety concerns the awareness that comes from these discussions trumps the the annual event,

78324,i live in dc groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day never makes the news public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do nt know what they are doing worst part it s never anyone who will fight back not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 1315 but they have seriously injured folks in the past brain damage and internal bleeding i typically avoid groups of young black men now i feel a little bad about it like i m being racist but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted,9

78328,not only did they assault a veteran with a deadly weapon  they used his credit cards at locations should nt be too tough to find them fuck these kids,8
78329,this is a pretty typical mugging the mugger aggressively asks you a question  and regardless of your answer they either beat you or ask for money sometimes it s shit like  do you care about the homeless   and if you say  yes  then they aggressively ask for money and if you say no they get upset and threaten you and say you are a liar if you say no  they threaten to beat you or they just get violent either way  you are going to end up giving them your walletmoney another common one is asking you for a cigarette if you do nt have any  they will accuse you of having one and not giving it to them because of some stupid reason  racism  greed  etc  and then get aggressive and demand money for a pack of cigarettes whenif you pull out your wallet they will just grab it and walk away or beat you and run  i was on a bus and had a guy ask for my cell phone to make a call  when i said no  he said i was a racist because i assumed he was going to steal it made a big scene and stood up and got in my face and started slapping my head until i gave him the phone then he got off the bus  same principle with this happens all the fucking time if they get caught they usually say shit like  oh he gave it to me  i did nt steal it  scumbags only reason this one made the news is because it was a war vet,9
78330,pieces of shit who ve done nothing but take from societ,8
78331,i hope that the assailants rot in prison,7
78332,from the daily caller article  gt   i believe this was a hate crime and i was targeted because of my skin color   marquez told the dcnf  too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the main stream media refuses to report on it  woah there racist  only black people can be the victim of a hate crime  now take your beating and shut the hell up about these underprivileged disadvantaged teen youths,8
78333,i m sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case,8
78334,lock these shitheads up and throw away the ke,8
78335,black lives do matter these teens  lives  however do not,9
78336,every fucking time a cop shoots a black guy  justified or not  we have people like obama telling us we have to do some  soul searching  and when cities like dc and baltimore  i live around both and can personally attest that shit like this happens all the time and is usually never reported  and detroit and new york and such have this shit happen  it s a non issue  fuck all of it  trump 201,8
78337,do white lives matter to blacks,6
78338,i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold  it s really political blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims  and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws  and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm  how much power do the sjws really have  will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution,8

78340,best optionavoid dc because it s a shit hole,7
78341, across the street from the fbi headquarters,6
78342, do black lives matter if you do nt agree we ll beat and rob you   and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement,8
78343,i would like to remind everyone that bernie sanders has aligned himself with and defended the black lives matter movement in many of his speeches he talks about sandra bland  michael brown  eric garner and in typical fashion blames racism and the white establishment sanders never once mentions the blacks that are home invading in indianapolis  kansas city  atlanta  etc he never once talks about the blacks that have shot at and killed police  most recently a 19 year old black man shoots an officer in mississippi black lives matter and politicians like sanders are waging that the future will be less white and in that future you folks can imagine who will be the most vile and racist  edit  from today  white house tweets shoutout to grammy winner of best rap album  still no word on recent spate of cop killing,9
78344,let s see if this gets labeled as the hate crime it very clearly is  who am i kidding  that wo nt happen,8
78345,i do not think that black lives matter more than anyone elses if anyone else does  they do nt understand what equality is fuck blm,8

78371,he s clearly at risk of fleeing  this is the only sane solution,1
78373,how do i get one of these fuck around on the internet jobs,9
78374,because twitter has been such a phenomenal business succes,9
78375,gt  luckie  s new role will entail working with media organizations  as well as government organizations  to understand how they  re currently using reddit and what their needs are from the platform  luckie told me he  ll then take that feedback and build it into reddit  s product  with the goal of making reddit more accessible to a broader community of people  so reddit will listen to what they like and dislike and then hand feed us whaat they want us to hear no longer will it be us posting what we find interesting and up or down voting it for exposure as much as it is meant to be  that s what i am hearing just another nail,9
78376,gt  the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do nt we have that subreddit already ,8
78377,will this have an impact on integrity within certain front page  news related  and default subs concerning submissionsdeletionsetc,5
78378,so more sponsored posts too bad voatco is such a shitty alternative,8
78379,the entire article talks about his race  reddit  you are a disappointing piece of shit,7
78380,i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites,7
78381,so is his job to come around and censor our posts,6
78382,great  now reddit is stealing other people s diversity hires  jesus  there really is just no oc on this site anymore  is there,6
78383,just as a precaution  i think we all should be putting on our life jackets,6
78384,does this dude give off  profitability  pixie dust when he walks around the office  what is causing all of these companies  reddit  yahoo  twitter  vox  salon  mashable  github  gawker  etc  in decline to try and make up for shitty business practices with diversity hires  it does nt matter how many black activist and feminists you hire  that wont solve a lack of profitability and coming from a company that tanked  and you were suppose to be part of the solution  is nt exactly a gold star on your resume you are suppose to jump ship from companies that are failing not get on board,7
78385,aka manipulator in chief,5
78386,so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming and this was the great marketing that is killing them,6
78387,that seems like quite a comedown  with all due respect to this fine institution,3
78388,let s see what shitty changes they come up with 144 character limit  perhaps,4
78389,it s about ethics in reddi,3
78390,just read about how twitter is filtering political content of a particular kind good news for reddit  they re on their way to being another propaganda wing of the left,1
78391,great  a news manager  amp  head of journalism  with the attention span of one sentence  and the intellectual depth of a drunk on a 24 hour train ride  note  reddit is a whore for anything that emanates out of the roman catholic ponzi generating pope s pie hole perhaps the new head of journalism  could find another criminal organization to support on reddit instead of the catholic church criminal empire,
78395,colleges really need to stop expelling students due to these kangaroo courts  i m fine with them if it s from breaking a school infraction like alcohol on a dry campus or something of that sort but  if a student is accused of a criminal offense  let the courts deal with it and decide from there  schools are nt equipped to deal with these kinds of cases  nor should they be expected to be these are lifechanging accusations and need to be treated as such  for the benefit of both parties involved,9
78396,gt  ut investigators later decided  that the evidence supported a finding that  he  had sexually assaulted ms roe  the opposite of the conclusion reached by the more experienced detectives of the police department   the lawsuit says the dean of students then recommended he be expelled  ah but the police are looking for evidence that he did it  college tribunals assume he did and require he provide evidence that he did nt  which  typically  the accused is not allowed to present,9
78397,gt  one plaintiff is a 24yearold recent graduate  the other is a 21yearold student who is one semester away from graduating with a bachelor  s degree in physics  their lawsuits say   in the graduate  s case  he faces being banned from any ut system campus  being denied a shot at a ut graduate degree and having a notation put on his transcript   the undergrad faces expulsion in addition to the same punishments  that does nt make any sense to me why would an institution retroactively amend the transcript of someone  who already graduated  to say this person violated school policy  after graduating   this seems to be more evidence that they re trying to scapegoat the plaintiffs here i mean  if they were concerned with the alleged victim s wellbeing more than trying to look  tough on sexual assault   what is the point of amending the transcript,9
78398,who s the idiot who decided that kangaroo courts were a good idea,9
78399,are we to the point where  sexual assaultrape  almost no longer have a meaning    you getting hammered and hooking up with a hammered guy is not rape  nor is it assault he should sue her for the exact same thing,8
78400,i once saw a swedish movie called ondskan   evil  that drove me to become a lawyer today  here  https  enwikipediaorgwikievil_  2003_film   plot one of the key issues that caught my attention in this movie is the disregard of the law the school had to the protagonist s rights when he hired a lawyer  because of some grievance he had with the school  it backed off immediatly when the lawyer lay down the letter of the law to the headmaster of that educational institution in front of all his guests  in this university of texas sexual assault case  i believe imhlo  l is for legal   that the constitution sets a foundation of rules for everyone inside it s jurisdiction  and no internal policy that ut may have can go against the rules set by the us constitution everyone should enjoy the right of being innocent until proven guilty  and time and time again people are being layed off their jobs  students expelled  lives ruined because of yettobeproven  accusations  the right thing that any institution  like ut  should always do is address all cases of criminal behavior by always recognizing first the accused innocence until proven guilty in a court of law  edit  grammar,8
78401,gt  the friend said she thought the woman was conscious because  when she saw her kissing this man  she was awake and talking  the lawsuit says  so intentionally or not the woman who claimed to be assaulted is not telling the truth  editand they decided to expel him without even talking to the student his first chance to give his side was an appeal for his expulsion this is a fucking kangaroo court  edit2  the second lawsuit claims expulsion against a student was recommended without the alleged victim ever personally making a sex assault accusation  http  kxancom20160205lawsuitsagainstutallegebiasagainstmalesinsexassaultcase,9
78402,gt  the undergrad  s lawsuit says he had sex with a woman who was not a ut student after leaving a house party near campus sometime after midnight on march 6  2015 about a month later  the woman  s father called ut police and accused the man of sexually assaulting his daughter  fuck this i understand that if a woman is  actually  rapedmolestedassaulted it could be hard to come forward  but waiting a month or longer and  then  reporting it is bullshit you get raped  you report it immediately the longer you wait  the more i m going to doubt your accusation,7
78403,gt  university police never spoke to the woman the undergrad was accused of assaulting and no criminal charges were ever pursued  his lawsuit says the father  s report was referred to the ut dean of students  okay what the hell  seriously  though its this sort of thing that makes me really hate schools handling sexual assault cases on their own the police did nt even talk to the accused victim  but decided to tell the dean instead  it feels like it happens all the time when we have these alternate systems of punishment we stop treating crimes like crimes and treat them like rule infractions a rule infraction is cheating on a test an alleged assault is a crime treat it like one,7
78404,eli5 kangaroo courts thanks,8
78405,activist administrators  check lack of due process  check prohibited from legal council or cross examination of the accuser  check nothin to see here  move along people,6
78406,well  they are probably right these school kangaroo courts have demonstrated they have no respect for the privacy and rights of the accused  and are only interested in demonstrating how seriously they take sexual assault accusations,6
78407,male privilege,8
78408,the real lesson here is do nt trust anyone i certainly do nt anymore,6
78409,reddit is nt okay with witch hunts  but the university of texas and 1600s salem encourage them,7
78410,stay away from liberal colleges  they are cesspools of tumblrina ideals  i could barely stand the required diversity classes from my public university nothing but priviledge  patriarchy  and man hatin,8
78411,it seems to me that a public institution has to follow the sixth amendment  which grants  the right to a public trial without unnecessary delay  the right to a lawyer  the right to an impartial jury  and the right to know who your accusers are and the nature of the charges and evidence against you,6
78412,jane roe because jane doe would be incest,4
78413,so these students that are expelled do they have to still pay back their loans even though they do nt get a degree now and can they carry their credits over to another school or are they now worthless,5
78414,i love how at the end she implies that if there were a person punching people randomly on campus they would choose to not involve the police presumably so that the assault victims could  control their own destiny,3
78415,30 year old here  and planning on returning to school with all this insanity about social values exploding everywhere  i may just hold off a few more years and wait for school to become a profitable idea again,3
78416,gt  the university has been placed under enormous political pressure to appear tough on those accused of sexual assault  there s your problem right there how about be tough on those convicted of sexual assault and those whom the law decides are innocent be treated as such,3
78417,umso expel the drunken slut too  right  i could get behind that they both got drunk and made bad choices that reflect poorly on the school kick em both out  why only the male  did he conspire in some way to get her drunk  if they re both adults that got drunk and fucked then they re both equally guilty,7
78418,considering that almost every case of a rape accusation that s come out massively public has been shown to be fraudulent  i m reserving judgement on this one,3
78419, ut investigates more than 100 allegations of sexual assault a year  and that number is growing  liebman said   how the hell are there hundreds of allegations a year that s insane this reminds me of the play the crucible  i saw you with the devilcommunistscapitalists  homo raptorus,1
78420,damned if you do damned if you dont,1
78421,seems like the girl was so hammered that she could nt remember the sex figured it would be less shameful if she accused him of assault,1
78428,i was happier before i knew this subculture existed,9
78429,so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10 that does nt make much sense,9
78430,how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killedhow from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human,9
78431,one of these videos was sent to me many years ago  forwarded on a myspace page  yeah  many  years ago   they were trying to  raise awareness  when they sent it to me to help the people get caught  but all they really ended up doing was spreading that ghastly thing to more points of the internet i wo nt describe a single second of it  but suffice it to say that it s horrifying i ve never been able to remove the memory i ve been through a lot in my military career  and yet seeing a 2minute version of one of those videos was easily the most horrible thing i have ever witnessed,9
78432,gt  brent justice  54  was convicted and sentenced monday for cruelty to nonlivestock animals  i guess justice has been served,9
78433,i ca nt imagine the mentality of the person making it or watching it and people get off on it    who the hell sees a cat being stabbed in the eye and thinks  hey  time to get the jergens  ,9
78434,no complaints from me but i ve noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago,9
78435,for once  reading a story of horrifying animal abuse does nt fill me with rage this must be what justice feels like finally  an appropriate sentence so sick of people like these getting slaps on the wrist due to inadequate animal protection laws,9
78436,i read the title then thought  hhmmm what s an animal crush video   who would have thunk it  animal crush videos are videos of animals getting crushed there goes some of the little remaining faith i had in humanit,9
78437,psa  if for some reason you come here first  and you do nt know what crush videos are  please do nt look them up,8
78438,i m not saying this is nt some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder,9
78439,who the fuck beats off to animals being killed  what the fuc,7

78443,only 10 minutes in  and i ve already had enough reddit for today,6
78444,gt  investigators said justice filmed a scantily clad richards  sometimes masked  stabbing animals  including a puppy  a kitten and a chicken  as well as chopping off their limbs and urinating on them while making sexual comments to the camera  what the actual fuck,6

78446,you can kill your spouse  drunk drive and kill 4 people  steal millions of dollars from the american people  or molest dozens of children in a church of a period of 30 years and literally get less jail time when we say we love our doggos  and kittys   we fucking mean it,6
78447,i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective it was the first exposure i d ever had to this subculture  crush fetish   after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals  their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse that s all i have to say about that,1
78449,as someone who just for the first time heard the term animal crush videos  i wash that i had nt something is seriously wrong with you if this is what gets you off,7

78453,if slaughter houses had glass walls  everyone would quit eating animals the cognitive dissonance in here is incredible,5
78454,i definitely think this guy should be punished and i m glad he was punished  but it blow my mind how a guy like this can get 50 years and a pedophile or rapist can get 1020 or less,5
78455,i do nt understand how the sicko who did the maiming and killing gets 10 years  but the man who filmed it gets 50 that woman should not see light ever again,1

78468,tl  dr  apple has to provide the means to extract encrypted data from the device fbi will then try to decrypt it  i assume by brute force  would would be easy for a 4digit pin   the interesting part is that the device is owned by farook s employer  the san bernardino county department of public health had they been following proper device protocol  they would already have administrator access to it  this was literally government property used for terrorism  and now unsearchable not due to the  encryption  boogeyman but their own ineptitude,7
78469,gt  the judge ruled tuesday that the cupertinobased company had to provide  reasonable technical assistance  to the government in recovering data from the iphone 5c  including bypassing the autoerase function and allowing investigators to submit an unlimited number of passwords in their attempts to unlock the phone apple has five days to respond to the court if it believes that compliance would be  unreasonably burdensome  so it sounds like the government does nt think apple can bypass it for them  just make it easier for them to brute force i bet judge s ruling will hold up  too,4
78470,i have this hunch that this is all for show and that the fbi has access through the nsa to all of this stuff why would they cancel prism  it s not like your average citizen can inspect the electronic infrastructure of this country and verify that  for example  metadata collection has stopped i think after edward snowden they sat in a room and decided to keep doing it and act like they were stopping it i would  i sound like a conspiracy theorist but i really do think the risks of terrorism are so great and siphoning data so easy that they re still doing it,1

78494,the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison,5
78495,are they only being killed for food  that s slaughter  if they are being killed for management purposes  that s called culling,7
78496,it s population control  hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use,6

78510,personally working as security guard in a hospital  and having to deal with people who have mental health issues its not fun  or safe and generally the actual hospital staff is nt very helpful i ve been kicked in the head  punched in the face  and many other things happen sometimes these people can not be handled and tazeing could deescalate the situation,4
78511,from what i ve read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops it looks like the taser use was justified sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca nt be deescalated otherwise  has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died,6
78512,this is unacceptable tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are nt,7
78513,he died 5 days later at a different hospital  clickbait headline i m sure we ll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death,6
78514,well at least the officers saved the victim from harming  himself ,1
78515,he died a week later he was also resisting arrest,3
78516,officers ca nt subdue people without shocking them to deathstun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only not some wack trying to get mental help,
78517,oh this is lame  his identity has not been released  nor the race of the officers   wtf does that have to do with anything  oh that s right more race bating by the media,1
78518,police are to trigger happy they could easily have uses theiroh,1
78519,the article states he was attacking staff and police using glass vials the police were not obliged to wrestle this violent person and risk getting stabbed by broken glass it s pretty simple  do nt violently attack innocent people and you wo nt be tased,
78520,police are not there  to protect and serve  you  edit   warren v district of columbia   https  enwikipediaorgwikiwarren_v_district_of_columbia  is just one example that downvoters should read,
78522,for those of you incapable of rtfa before making racist comments  the bride and groom are actors hired by a charity to raise awareness and the 37000day statistic refers to child marriages estimated worldwide not specifically in this local area,9
78523,gt  nearly 15 million girls  some as young as eight or nine so  some as young as eight,9
78524,37000 child marriages every day  if that s the case why are these people shocked  surely they must see these pedo photoshoots on the reg,9
78525,these statistics seem unreliable estimated 12 billion new child marriages by 2050  even taking the 37000 a day estimate at face value that would only get you to 500 million by 2050  i mean seriously  assuming population growth rates remain unchanged  unlikely as the rate is slowing significantly  there will only be  47 billion women born under the age of 8 by 2050 is it truly believable that a quarter of women born in the next 34 years are going to be placed into a child marriage,8
78526,ok this is a serious issue  but fuck the misleading clickbait title,8
78527,paid to act and still goes for the hoverhand,4
78528,as young as nine nine years old damn,4
78529,i doubt half the people even read the article and thought the video was real they were actors and were stopped by plenty of people who called them criminals,6
78530,i just wanted to point out the hand hove,1
78531,where in lebanon was this  looks a bit like beirut if so  i can understand the mixed reactions i would wager the reactions would be less mixed in the northern or southern regions,1
78532,i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country it s picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual some of them just do nt realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do,1
78533,eh personally i m more concerned with men sitting with their legs spread on public transportation that s the real problem,1
78534,at that rate the entire female population of the us would be married off in 11 years certainly 37000 child marriages a day is unsustainable or maybe it s media hype,1

78536,pakistan tried to pass a law banning child marriages and the clerics said   nope  the koran says as soon as a girl menstruates  she can be dtf whoever she s married to  so you re not allowed to pass a law like that  so they took it back and child marriage continues to be legal,

78571,also cars bad guys use those a lot and the internet also food,9
78572,casinos would lobby against it a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small it would fit in a plastic shopping bag a million dollars in small bills is massive  there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash,8
78573,how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 ,9
78574,yeah if my big illegal bag of money was heavier  i d totally reconsider all the crime i do to obtain large bags of money it just would nt be worth the hassle,7
78575,thank you but fuck no it s bad enough carrying around 100s to go buy cars amp  bikes on craigslist  now you want me to carry boxes of 20s   the  100 has plenty of legitimate uses  no need to make things harder for the 999  of the population that s lawabiding,9
78576,thats why they got rid of the  500 billand it didnt work so well,8
78577,keep marijuana and cocaine illegal  it s the 100 dollar bills that are the problem,7
78578,i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four  5000 bills instead of two  10000 was too taxing better go straight,8
78579,clearly  100 bills are the problem,7
78580,people still listen to larry summers  i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008 or does cnn still think repealing glasssteagall was a good idea,7
78581,it s not about stopping criminals it s about controlling peoples money with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically this is what done in europe to prevent  tax fraud ,7
78582,might aswell remove any chemicals or equipment in the world that can make drugs aswell larry summers idea is stupid  it would nt just hurt criminals  it would hurt the innocent people aswell,7
78583,in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the  100 bill it is very popular outside the us,5
78584,the new blue  100 bills are too cool to replace,5
78585,80  of the money supply being in  100 bills is the key statement this would likely be the first  and easiest  step to killing paper currency this is one of the initial hurdles to overcome  because they do nt give a fuck about it being tough on criminals  come on  when looking to implement negative interest rates,8
78586,the thing about secondary labor markets  drugs  gambling  prostitution  etc  is that prohibition is what causes the main problems related to them these are black markets that will always have demand as long as the activities are forced underground by punitive policy  and that demand will always find a way around obstacles  making life marginally more difficult for the suppliers is only doing to make the products more dangerous  not less desirable,5
78587,that is the most twisted logic   no more  100 bills  guess i ll stop dealing crack,5
78588,okay larry last time we listened to you we deregulated the banks in 1999 nah larry  i m not gon na listen to you,5
78589,make it illegal for poor people to ever have cash money so that you can freeze their accounts when their name shows up on the noflylist  eh  they already ca nt buy a car in cash without the dealership informing on them to the feds,6
78590,how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds   ,4
78591,i urge everybody here to watch inside job  it will shock you on how thoroughly corrupt this dude is  along with his buddies on wall street washington now he wants the gov to ban the  100 because of nirp  he does nt give a fuck about criminals using those or tax evasions do not listen to what this turd says,4
78592,attention  we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash  except pennies   cash is privacy and should be a basic right,1
78593,i wonder what larry would think about paul krugman s onetime pet project  the  trilliondollar coin   http  krugmanblogsnytimescom20130107bereadytomintthatcoin  _r  0 ,5
78594,is something going on with all the major currencies  i saw a similar story about the euro notes too  http  wwwdailymailcoukwiresreutersarticle3448066ecbconsidersscrapping500euronotehtml also http  wwwdailymailcouknewsarticle3437590banksurgedban50notesbidendcashhandculturehelprecoupbillionstaxtreasuryhtml all these stories within a week of each other  i would nt be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency,3
78595,currently in colorado  hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash,3
78596,scrap larry summers  and get rid of a criminal,3
78597,the only relevance to crime is the idea itself scam to grab more control of your money  bankster shenanigans do nt fall for it,3
78598,the banks love this this means less people holding cash and more money that they can use to fuck us over remember folks  the rules are changing so that the money on deposit with banks is legally not yours if there s a bank failure  your money will be used to bail out the banks  the move is simply an extension of the war on cash,3
78599,the fed stopped printing any bills higher than  100 in 1945 they began destroying the larger denominations actively in 1969  100 in 1945 is equivalent to  1300 today adjusting for inflation frankly they should be talking about issuing a  200 and  500 bill  if not also a  1000 bill,3
78600,larry summers should be in prison  he is one of the architects of the 2008 collapse he also was instrumental in the repeal of glasssteagall the world would be better off without this fool and his dangerous ideas  http  wwwsourcewatchorgindexphp  title  larry_summer,3
78601,does larry mean wall st criminals  of course not  white male entitlement it s what larry is all about unfortunately obama was dumb enough to bring summers into his administration where he flailed about  lamely attempting to cover upmake excuses as to why the theater burned down in 2008 with the financial  masters of the universe  still inside  larry proved his overall dumbness by predicting 2011 would be  recovery summer   based on nothing  no evidence just his  expert  opinion  there was no recovery in 2011,3
78602,bring back the  500 and  1000 dollar bills dammit,3
78603,larry summers  ladies and gentlemen one of the masterminds of financial deregulation is now proposing another hair brained idea summers  go clone yourself so you can go fuck yourself,3
78604,just legalize crime everybody wins,3
78605,fuk this illuminati puppe,4
78606,the bulk of the value of cash in circulation is from  100 s get rid of cash and the fed can do any crazy policy it wants this is a necessary step towards negative interest rates nobody believes the government gives two shits about money laundering  florida real estate laws and hsbc getting zero criminal charges shows that is not the case,3
78607,banksters do nt even use cash oh wait you re talking about the little criminals carry on,4
78608,another attempt by the wealthy to outlaw cash our money is nt our money  according to the elite,5
78609,then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination ,3
78610,scrap the two  the single  the penny  half dollar and nickel instead,3
78611,scrap the drugs too  make them illegal  oh wait,1
78612,but they just click buttons on a computer and create and move money around  wait  what,1
78613,than how will our government and cia function,1
78614,interning theory main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks,1
78615,singapore has had the 10000 singapore dollar bill for some time it is still legal tender  but is going to be phased out slowly old notes will not be replaced  this is a calculated strategy by the sg government to comply with international counterterrorism and anti money laundering efforts  but minimising their own vulnerability to regulatory arbitrage,1
78616,is nt the  100 bill the staple of american foreign trade  i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like  interestfree  loans  though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ,1
78617,politicians do nt use  100s so how could it harm criminals,1
78618,what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then,1
78619,gt  the  100 bill is actually the second most common us bill in circulation  behind the  1 bill  gt  nearly 80  of the  14 trillion of us currency in circulation is in  100 bills much of it is held outside the united states  i m no math magician  but this does nt seem to fit,1
78620,yeah  just watch  they will scrap it right down to the 20  anyone who wants to make largeish purchases will have to use electronic accounts that can be tracked  oh yeah   because crime  not  because government needs to track your every move,1
78621,this is one of those ideas that seems silly at first but the more you think of it  the more it makes some sense,1
78622,this is stupid  criminals will make due with what ever currency there is  they do nt fucking care and any one who thinks otherwise is a desk jocky looking for something to do,1
78623,switch to all coins while you re at it if  100 weighed an ounce   1600 would weigh a pound  1 mil would weigh 625 lbs,1
78624,larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone,1
78625,how would this effect the bitcoin market,1
78626,this is about getting rid of cash  not making life tougher for criminals that way  when the fed institutes negative interest rates  you the lowly consumer will be forced to spend your savings to avoid being charged for saving,1
78627,funny thing  today also the eu central bank ceo emanuele prodi announced that 500 euro bills are to be outphased for the same reason apparently american criminals manage to launder money with a bill that s 6 times less in value  is nt this just a global banking scheme to rob us the power over our own money,1
78628,yes those evil people in government would love to get rid of cash and make everyone just use electronic money because then  the bank has your money and you only have an iou which they may  or may not  pay you back in the future  look at cyprus in 2013 where people did nt get their full deposited funds back because of the financial crisis  also they can charge you negative interest rateswhich means you have to pay for the bank to hold your funds  and of course if the govt has your money  then they have a great deal more power over you in deciding whether they should be nice and give it back to you or not  this is another reason why bitcoin is good  although they will ban that long before they ban cash,1
78629,now  whatchall wan na do  wan na be ballers  shotcallers  brawlers  who be dippin in the benz wit tha spawlers,
78630,hmm sounds like portable bitcoin exchange devices would be cool carry a bitcoin wallet in a little  5 raspberry pilike thing with an lcd display  hook it up to another  punch in transfer codes  both devices show  are you sure   both people hit yes  see the verification displayed  and bill sizes become irrelevant and everybody can keep negotiating with cash when buying motorcycles off craigslist no matter what these control freak asshats try to pull,
78631,you can still buy silver and gold anonymously  and cash out up to  1500 worth at one time with no tax penalty,
78632,but  but  how will weezy and drizzy write raps now if they ca nt talk about dem big faces,
78634,apollo  which owns protection 1 parent prime security services borrower llc will pay  42 per share of adt  a premium of nearly 56  over adt s closing share price friday of  2687  gt  tyco international  which purchased adt in 1997  spun off adt as a independent publiclytraded company in 2012,1
78636,this makes sense a lot of people in science fields relating to cancer formation  such as radiology and medicinal biology  are of the opinion that most cancerous tumors are actually quietly killed by the body before they can reach critical mass to defend themselves  and the ones that prove dangerous are the ones that either do nt register to t cells or which grow too quickly to be snuffed to simplify  the reasons for this are simple  not everyone dies from cancer  and everyone gets exposed to carcinogens given the rate of mutation  the influence of radiation  the amount of background radiation  etc  that everyone is unavoidably exposed to  we should all develop tumors if there is a true casual relationship if you simply say that the body is helpless against them naturally  we would all die from cancer the body  must  be defending itself from them given that we do nt  in fact  it s basically accepted as scientific truth cancer is nt simply the presence of cancerous tumors  it s the presence of cancerous tumors that have the right surrounding cells  in the right quantity  that do nt die from immune system intervention and which have favorable growth conditions most small tumors simply do nt have the right conditions  and die studies have confirmed that the ones that register as cancer are a subset of all tumors that might form  because this subset avoids the usual limiting factors  so  going back to the article  this is simply taking the bodies natural process for fighting tumors and guiding it to specific cancers it might normally miss and saying  go get it   then praying you did nt just kill the poor sap with his now manically overenthusiastic immune system,6
78637,gt  the treatment involves removing the tcells from patients  tagging them with  receptor  molecules that target cancer  and putting them back into the body in an infusionthe targeting molecules  known as chimeric antigen receptors or cars  came from specially bred genetically engineered mice   gt  in one study  94 percent of participants suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia  all  said their symptoms vanished completely after they were treated with the modified blood cells  known as tcells  it looks like this could be a very  very big deal i m surprised that  as of this comment  this post is not getting much attention,7
78638,now they just need to find a way to reverse liver cirrhosis and i can live forever,1
78639,this is a breakthrough right up until the pharmaceutical companies buy the process and tuck it away forever  there s no money to be made in curing a disease,1
78640,i m rather hopeful that we ll be able to cure most cancers within the next 20 years or so  and hopefully before that we ll have something that wo nt cure it but will reliably halt cancer so that a patient can just wait for the actual cure to be found  as with we do with hiv i believe  maybe i m being too optimistic  but you got ta be optimistic about something in this miserable world,1
78642, every  prepackaged shredded cheese has it it s the most common anticlumping agent used around the world the argument is that the labels said 100  cheese,9
78643,labels should be accurate end of story if the product inside does not match the label ingredients  it is fraud and should be prosecuted as such,8
78644,that s why you buy a little wedge of parm and use a microplane grater on it to shave cheese onto your pasta the wedge lasts a very long time  and in the end it s cheaper than the nasty jars,7
78645,cellulose is the actual substance you ll find it in all pregrated cheeses these guys were just busted putting too much in to save    lettuce is also made of cellulose where commercial outfits get it for cheese  i guess could be just about any plant judged edible  including  sure  trees  also who knows what kind of cheese you re supposedly getting much nicer to get a hunk of the real stuff and a crank grater  my knuckles hate box graters with a passion ,8
78646,so my penne has wood,7
78647,so the correct labeling is 92  cheese and 8  wood filler  i think that s right,6
78648,solution  buy your parmesan  domestic or real  and grate it yourself tastes better too if you re really lazy  grate it and freeze until you need it,7
78649,damn were becoming like china  next will have faked food,6
78650,what kind of wood   are we talking the high quality organic stuff  or factory processed scrap wood  because goddamnit if they ve been slipping cheap wood shavings into my welfarecheese  we re going to have an fucking issue on our hands,4
78651,lol  wood it is cellulose trying to get clicks,6
78652,i m safe  source  only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti,3
78653,i shred my own parmesan cheese  it makes worlds differenc,3
78654,this is why i do nt buy nasty sargento cheese ever taste it  it tastes like wood  i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better,3
78655,hmm i am pretty sure i misread that title,1
78656,it s cheaper by the chunk anyways,1
78657,similar to olive oil  most parmesan cheese is nt even parmesan cheese,1
78658,my parents always called it cardboard chees,1
78659,it still taste oh so goooooooood,1
78660,if it tastes good  i do nt care,1
78661,pene means weiner in spanish that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood,1
78662,maybe they are just trying to get people to eat a whole door over the course of a year,1
78663,just buy the blockwedge and grate your own,1
78664,gt  she faces up to a year in prison  so  what re you in for blondie    just beat me up and get it over with,1
78665,cellulose is indeed an anti clumping agent if they use more and it does not change taste  i am ok with it at least it has less calories  ,
78666,if you buy preshredded or grated cheese  you deserve to eat wood,
78668,if the proposal came from a doctor or scientist  i would be 100  on the side of this bill but it comes from a senator  which makes me want to question it  scientific papers require peer review from the most qualified people to call bullshit on an idea before you can get it published as legitimate i m not saying i m questioning the idea  but i do nt know enough about the process of bills and laws to give it my automatic seal of approval  i think it s a good idea to administer anesthesia to an unborn human that can feel pain whether or not it increases the cost of abortion but the cost is still a talking point all i can do is hope that the people in charge of the decision in the end have the same concerns that i do,8
78669,i mean  we already use anesthesia on fetuses when performing surgery in the womb for exactly this reason  so it s hardly surprising  http  wwwdoctorsonfetalpaincomfetalpaintheevidence5documentatio,7
78670,wether a fetus is under anesthesia is completely dependent on the type of anesthetic being performed any general anesthetic also anesthetizes the fetus while other types like spinal or local do not even then  there is no accurate way to quantify or measure awareness in fetuses  much less adults undergoing anesthesia the body also still responds to pain under anesthesia  as its an autonomic response  so the definition of  feeling pain  is not something that should be measured i feel like awareness  which is impossible to measure in a fetus regardless  is a real idicator of humanity an easy solution would be to simply do all elective abortions under general anesthesia  which may cost more  but is easily doable i have no idea what the preferred method of anesthesia is  if any  for elective abortions  source  i do anesthesia in a catholic hospital,5
78671,i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them,7
78672,they have nt decided at what point of gestation this would happen  gt  montana lawmakers passed a similar law in 2015 requiring fetal anesthesia before surgeries  including abortion  after 20 or more gestational weeks  so  4 months the general consensus for viability outside the womb is around 6 monthsish for some the concept of consciousness coincides with viability outside the womb,6
78673, this is a review on fetal pain   http  jamajamanetworkcomarticleaspx  articleid  201429amp  resultclick  1  from clinical review  although it is 10 years old it says  gt  evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques similarly  limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion,5
78674,is nt this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor s office  would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder,5
78675,ignorant people propose bill based on said ignorance,
78676,i m going to talk about this as delicately as possible i  genuinely  want thoughts and opinions on this subject  i am asking that no one become immediately offended by what i m about to say rather than respond with your opinion telling me why you believe that my view should change i am childfree i do nt want kids  i m 35  so it s pretty much set in stone at this juncture in my life i do nt see myself as a prolife or prochoice supporter and the reason for that is because i kind of agree with both sides on one hand i firmly believe that the destruction of a human being  born or not  is murder it fits the definition  of  murder before you downvote me into oblivion  let me be clear it s not the votes i care about it s that you understand where i m coming from even though i have that belief  i also believe that some people were just not meant to be children but therein lies another debate  why do nt they place it in adoption  because most of the time unwanted children are kept  they re not placed into adoption and when they re kept their chances of being neglected as children  whether it be mentally  emotionally  or physically  rise exponentially i certainly would nt want to have a child and resent it i  do nt  have children because frankly i m mean as a damn snake i do nt see any part of me that could ever have a child and not lose my temper with it and i would nt put a kid through that  because  i  was put through that i would be a horrible parent  anyway  i have a point i swear if you re going to have an abortion  why anesthetize it first  do i believe that it can feel  absolutely  but you re killing it i mean it s not like you re putting it to sleep and saying   here  fight for your life  you re fucking killing it so why have a crisis of conscience about it  again  i m sorry if i offend anyone  that s not my intention i m just a realistic person and it is what it is sugarcoating it does nt change it the bill seems like a waste of time and tax dollars  edit  i do nt understand why this is being downvoted so  please  give me your views instead of leaving me wondering because if there s something i m not understanding it needs to be made clear again this is absolutely not about the votes rather than having a discussion,

78697,so this guy is innocent until proven guilty right  why is this investigation so short  we do nt know the details  why does it take a year to investigate an officer for shooting someone  and this takes a couple of days to charge this guy  is that disconnect enough to make anyone here question things enough to accept that there is a massive encompassing problem with our legal system  i always have to wonder because we see many of the same people calling for people to wait for details after an officer shoots someone  telling us not to be monday morning quarterbacks then stories like this pop up and we have those same people frothing at the mouth in this situation where it has nt been given the year plus of investigation that an officer who shoots someone would be given the guy is already guilty despite the cries to give officers the benefit of the doubt because of the innocent until proven principle,

78723,personally working as security guard in a hospital  and having to deal with people who have mental health issues its not fun  or safe and generally the actual hospital staff is nt very helpful i ve been kicked in the head  punched in the face  and many other things happen sometimes these people can not be handled and tazeing could deescalate the situation,4
78724,from what i ve read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops it looks like the taser use was justified sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca nt be deescalated otherwise  has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died,6
78725,this is unacceptable tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are nt,7
78726,he died 5 days later at a different hospital  clickbait headline i m sure we ll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death,6
78727,well at least the officers saved the victim from harming  himself ,1
78728,he died a week later he was also resisting arrest,3
78729,officers ca nt subdue people without shocking them to deathstun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only not some wack trying to get mental help,

78731,police are to trigger happy they could easily have uses theiroh,1
78732,the article states he was attacking staff and police using glass vials the police were not obliged to wrestle this violent person and risk getting stabbed by broken glass it s pretty simple  do nt violently attack innocent people and you wo nt be tased,

78751,living in germany and studying  i m gon na pay 300   335   for the upcoming semester  these 335  also includes a public transportation ticket  which is in your student id  that allows me to take the train  bus  tram etc at any time as much as i like in my entire state  books are nt nearly as expensive as in the us  the most expensive book i bought last semester was 80   89    but  seriously  95  of the content for the majority of the courses are uploaded on the university s website  files and documents which you can download for free  also  the university canteen offers you decent food for a fair price  normally around 35   in the end my biggest expenses during my semester are the coffees i buy on campu,9
78752,i m from the uk and have lived in germany for 6 years now i came here with a 20000 gbp student loan for a 4 year degree in computer science  now i m about to start a masters in web science that will cost me about 1000 eur for the 2 year course  parttime and remote  i m also just about to get german citizenship  most germans are happy to speak english  i have a job here and although most of the company speak english they make i point of speaking german with me  and i with them  i m not very good at german but am slowly learning now after 5 years of being very lazy about learning the language it s a very hard language to learn  screw those articles   but in time you ll get used to it  i absolutely love speaking to locals in german and being understood by them  to me it s like being on another planet and finally being accepted by the local populus  good luck to anyone who wants to come over  it is a wise move  come and see me near koblenz,9
78753,a friends son went to college in switzerland  we are american  even though he paid additional fees as a non native  and had to travel back and forth to europe  he still paid less than kids who went to local colleges,9
78754,come gather around the fire and listen to a tale of a spooky and simple explanation of our increasing tuition rates in the us  the government started giving student loans kids take the debt  the schools get the money tuition prices increase because they can rely on the kids to get a gov loan take away student loans  then schools ca nt rely on this money  kids ca nt afford the jacked up tuitions  enrollments drop  schools are forced to cut tuition  now more affordable again it s the same problem with mortgage crisis  just a different industry,9
78755,it s almost as if germany sees the benefit of having a well educated work force that is not bogged down by insurmountable debt,9
78756,my college actually sodomizes me,9
78757,whereas here in the states  they will gladly charge you a  250semester parking fee and you will still not actually be guaranteed a space,8
78758,maybe i should go to germany,9
78759,currently living in germany  as an american student on an international internship  what this is nt telling you is that the uni system is significantly different my roommates  all in engineering or other sciences  study all day every day they have a month of exams coming up  and they usually have only one exam per year you fail that  you fail no assignments  projects  etc  just that exam  did i mention this was a fraternity  yeah  they do nt go to uni because everyone does it  like america they work  they get accepted  and they work even more it is nt for partying  it is nt for meeting your spouse or friends  it s for becoming the best you can be  which is how a university should be  good luck to the americans coming here thinking it s anything like the states enjoy the d  ner,9
78760,something like this gets posted everysingleweek without fail and then a bunch of americans start making hasty decisions to just go study in germany because it s  free   oh and it has been this way for years so it is nt a new thing  the german courses that you will have to take for at least a year to reach fluency are around  300 a month and noduolingo is absolutely not enough to get you to the level you need to study at university  the fees for applications are at  75 then an additional 15  for each university you apply to after the first it can go well into the hundreds  the bank account you have to open for your student visa has to have a frozen amount of at least approx   8500 this is nt to say it is impossible but do nt expect roses and rainbows and raining beer amp  wurst to await your easy university life in germany  also american universities except the few ivy leagues or outstanding schools  baby the absolute shit outta you you can pretty much sail smoothly your first two years while you get your core courses out of the way in germany  you jump right into it in german remember  a different language a crazy  difficult language at that the high school diploma is also not equivalent to the german one that allows you to study at a university the equivalent would be a plethora of ap courses with really good grades or a high school diploma plus two years of college with really good grades and then you re equivalent to a german high school graduate  you will also most likely not be able to transfer credits  german bureaucracy  a bitch you will have to have german knowledge when applying for your visas or someone to be a translator there with you  you may have to do a prep year for certain programs as well it is also very competitive to get into even these programs  i sound like fucking scrooge but i ve been through all of it as so have many people i met along the way  it is possible but it will take a lot of hard work and dedication and time that you wo nt regret  losing  because it may not work out perfectly you may get rejected you may not be accepted for that semester a lot of the popular programs have a cap so it s very restricted in terms of amount of students accepted  do nt expect germany to be a country that is just waiting and fiddling its thumbs for the americans to come and study in their unis for  free  and think that they re gon na make it easy for you it is anything but,9
78761,my american husband started learning german at the age of 26 a year later he was admitted to vet school here he s almost finished now we ve been paying 120 euros a semester i think he s the only foreign student to not drop out in his class though the drop out rate is high even for germans while he s happy he is debt free  the immense stress of having to learn a very hard subject in a foreign language and a foreign system  bureaucracy is insane here   have caused many panic attacks and one major case of depression and he has nt even started the huge final exam yet but at least we wo nt be  200k in debt when this is over,8
78762,the fee is actually 150500  per semester books inclusive because of librarys and because we live in 2016 and share digitaly public transport also free  you get 600  per month plus health care  if your parents arent rich  this will be checked by government  as student  and will have to pay back   half of that   in worst conditions after you finished  also  after 3 semesters you must have passed 23 of your finals at any time to get your  baf  g  money  but this will only be checked once no money for extra semesters of course,9
78763,in my opinion let them come here  let them study here and let them stay here if they want besides the fact that the ones who stay make up for the cost of education it is a great way of cultural exchange  it s always nice to have friends from different countries  so if you are coming to the area of n  rnberg just text me ,8
78764,currently living in duisburg  germany and studying at the university of duisburgessen   my choice   i grew up in the us  but my parents are from germany after graduating high school it became apparent that studying in germany was an opportunity that i could not pass up i chose my current uni because it has an international studies in engineering program which allows me to pursue a bachelors degree in computer engineering with the first year taught entirely in english   costs   the costs are definitively low the semester fee  including public transport  is below 300   my total living expenses are below 700  a month and that includes health insurance   my experience so far   keep in my mind i m still in my first semester  as others have mentioned before  the majority of students quit after the first year last year  the failure rate of an exam taken by 200 students was over 95   attending lectures is completely voluntary and there is one exam at the end of each course that makes up 100  of your final course grade no homework is given and you are very much on your own forcing yourself to focus and learn everyday can be a serious challenge  feel free to comment or pm with any questions,7
78765,many american students also come with very false expectations about what german university is like you have to be way more self organised and please do nt expect multiple choice tests,9
78766,we need to stop this immigration because when america sends its people  it sends unskilled people and we have to spend our money on them we are going to build a wall  get america to pay for it and make germany great again,9
78767,you can only offer something for free if you limit supply fewer germans go to college than us students   only 30  of germans ages 2534 have completed a tertiary education  which includes academic degrees and some but not all vocational programs that  s below the oecd average  and below the us 45  attainment rate for the same age group  http  wwwlatimescomlocaleducationcommunitylameedufreecollegeeducationingermanybutnotincalifornia20151029htmlstoryhtml edit  so now i am amused that many people are suggesting that fewer people should go to college in the us  presumably other people  not so much themselves they are smart   it seems like this would be a less popular proposal than promising free tuition,9
78770,dude that deserve to be hung in the public square by their genitalia and beaten like a pinyata by roidedup baseball player,
78773, men who might be in their 30 s   real helpful description,7
78774,i got hit by a car in a parking lot once i punched the car really hard just so the driver realized he was hitting me it had nothing to do with challenging the driver to a fight or whatever,5
78777,it s what twitter has always been  a megahorn for loudmouths and self important egotists,6
78778,i m always shocked that people take any type of social media seriously  it s twitter  it s mostly fucking garbage opinions and stupid nonsense,6

78782,itt  pretentious neckbeard,1
78783,who is steven fry  is he related to phillip j fry,
78785,that article is really light on details  does anyone know why this happened  did the guy not respond to a court summons or something along those lines  is nt a default the judgement the usual result in that situation,9
78786,this happened in feb  2003 in minnesota as well  article   http  wwwmndailycom20030214usmarshalsarreststudentloandebtorstwincities,9
78787,what happens if you literally ca nt pay your loans  asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11  just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job  edit  something a lot of you do nt seem to realize is that these were private loans there s no forgiveness with those,9
78788,not really too much context given here  so it s hard to guess at the actual situation  but federal student loans  at least direct loans and the majority of those older loans passed back to fsa as they phased out the guarantee programs  do nt get sold to private collection agencies at this time maybe that part happened a while back  before current policies went into place and the collectors are taking advantage of the protections that federallyoriginated loans have  anyway  for people who are interested in learning more about how defaulted federal student loans are being collected today   check this out   https  wwwfbogovindex  s  opportunityamp  mode  formamp  id  216a8418f8e71f0c9c3475946ab100f8amp  tab  coreamp  _cview  1  they re currently in the middle of contracting new private collection agencies to service defaulted loans and you can see in the rfp documents how agencies are being scored and how that ties into account assignments  basically  for those who do nt feel like running through all of it  the big emphasis for student loan collections now is getting people through affordable rehabilitation options and into incomedriven repayment plans placements look like they re going to be based about 50  on careful regulatory compliance and borrower satisfaction surveys  which would make it extremely difficult for high pressure collections tactics to work out in the long run  none of that changes this story  just thought it was interesting in light of some of the comments i ve read that indicate people believe strongarm collection tactics for student loans will always be the norm  tldr  they re at least trying to throw a friendly paint job over the horribly broken federal student loan system these days,9
78789,if you dont show up to court after you have been served this is what happens he has been ignoring collection attempts  he got served and ignored that too im not in favor of this man being arrested but you cant ignore court summons if you get served you have to go,9
78790,upconwell said it best  gt  you are reading way to much into the article no one said they were violent no one said they had their guns drawn they are us marshals  they carry guns  every god damn day   gt  they probably went to his door  knocked he answered and they said  hey  we have a warrant for you for failing to appear in a federal court   he probably said  oh shit let me get some pants  gt  no violence  no guns drawn  everything was pretty standard and nonviolent  gt  plus  it should be noted that he was not arrested for failing to pay student loans  he was arrested for violating a court order,9
78791,how do you not pay a  1500 loan after 30 friggin years,9
78792,gt  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  this almost reads like satire,9
78793,i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors,9
78794,where in this article did it say  guns drawn  as most people are stating here  it says  with guns   every on duty us marshal goes through their day  with guns   someone signed a contract for a loan  and then spends almost three decades not paying it i agree that a police force should nt have been used there are financial measures that can be taken upon default of a loan rather than criminal  but i m really surprised by the circle jerk that s happening over a fox news article,9
78795,can i get a misleading title please,8
78796,you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day,6
78797,lol  you guys are so gullible the guy dodged this debt and refused to engage the proper authorities for 25 years this is nt a new college graduate that missed one payment then you have the cascade of predictable posts stating  boot lickers    debtors prison  and how in 30 years this will be the watershed moment we all look back to as we are enslaved by the government this is a statement case the feds took an extreme example and made an extreme example of this putz the goal of this action is compliance and to get folks to not ignore their obligations the money spent on this will scare the other million folks that are past due to actually pick up the phone and engage them to resolve the debt no one held a gun to this guy s head to sign up for the student loans and no one was stopping him for 25 years from making a payment plan for the remaining  1500 this guy deserved it and as a tax payer this is ok by me,9
78798,real story here dude was sued by the united state of america  he refused to appear  a default judgment was issued against him  he refused to appear for postjudgment depositions  judge issued an order directing him to appear in court  he ignored it and then the judge issued an arrest warrantincareration order and federal judges use us marshalls to enforce their orders  so he was nt arrested for having old student loans he was arrested for refusing to comply with a direct order from the judge  http  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386htm,8
78799,that dude could not come up with  1500 in 29 years,8
78800, a few years ago congress allowed the private sector to contract for student loan collections and so you have these private companies who are doing this  i find this scary  even though i have no student loans to pay off they dragged this dude to court and made him sign an agreement in front of their private attorney he had no attorney present  and was nt read any rights  edit  quote is from the video,9
78801,forever grateful i graduated with minimal student loans ca nt ignore bills for 25 years though  regardless of what those payments stem from from reading through the comments here  it seems like incomebased payment option is the smartest option,6
78802,i wish my student loan balance was  1500,6
78803,i knew this story was light on facts turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies  source   yahoo finance   https  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386html,6
78804,gt  our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is nt the first and wo nt be the last  this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least,8
78805,he was nt arrested for not paying his loan  he was arrested for not showing up in court  and the marshals did nt storm his house guns blazing they had guns  with them   like every other cop in the entire country,7
78806,if you take money and have no plans on paying it back  it s called stealing,9
78807,right the debt collectors just bought the debt  payed the filing fees to bring the case to court  threatened the man with their now official   pay us or else  and when he did not they used their settlement to have him arrested by the marshals nope  no government officers for hire here  just good old debt collection paid and serviced through the courts,5
78808,til that most people have no understanding how the court system works  yes  civil attorneys can issue subpoenas  yes  a court can hold you in contempt if you fail to appear yes  a potential punishment for contempt is a bench warrant for your arrest  tl  dr  you can not simply ignore subpoenas you may go to jail,5
78809,writing and publishing articles like this is dangerous the author offered a sensationalist angle on the  story  while leaving out key elements of why they were there in the first place ie missing court summons this is highly unethical and paints the federal government into a larger narrative that fox has been going for basically  rallying people by emotion not logic,5
78810,this just in  there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government film at 1,5
78811,student loans were made with certain assumptions about the future of the economy  both on the part of the schools  the tuition they charge   the lenders  and the student people should be required to pay their student loans but they should be adjusted downward  edit  this guy had a loan for  1500 measly bucks and did nt make any payments in 30 years  i would like to know if he was destitute  or just decided  fuck you everyone  i want to keep my money ,8
78812,misleading title the marshals service will  arrest  you if you fail to show up for a court appearance you are not being tossed in jail  you are being hauled into court when you refused to answer a summons  from the article   paul aker says he was arrested at his home last week for a  1500 federal student loan he received in 1987  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  does anyone feel sorry for this man   1500  be serious,7
78813,if i did nt pay back a federal loan for 29 years  i d kind of expect for there to be negative effects this dude did nt pay his loan  including when he was taken to court over it and received a judgment from the court specifically telling him to pay it if you ignore a court order  you re gon na have a bad time  i mean yes  the financial aid system needs to be fixed  but they re going after people who purposely are nt paying their loans which is a surprising amount of people  given how many refund chasers there are in the world for anyone else  there are programs like deferment options  sliding payscales  and whatever else along with loan forgiveness after 20 years  it s a shitty system  but this guy s case is not going to be the one to change it because he does nt deserve to have people dying on his hill for his particular cause,7
78814,i m socialist and firmly believe that education and medical care should be paid for by federal government out of contributions that we make  however with that said  if you are contributing member of society you have to be a special kind of asshole not to repay  1500 loan over the period of 29 years no matter what was that loan used for,8
78815,why is this news,3
78816,dude got letters in his mail for months to pay and appear in court  this doesnt just come out of the blue he refused to show up to court multiple times thats a criminal offense,5
78817,the revolution will not be subsidize,5
78818,the whole student loan thing is a complete disaste,6

78820,just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to the paper really is nt worth it otherwise college is becoming a joke anyways,5
78821,every interaction i have ever had with navient  they have done everything they can to work with me  is your payment affordable  would you like a deferment  etc  i have had to take them up on that because of divorce not saying that is everyone s experience but they have nt been the loan sharks everyone else seems to act like they are just one man s experience though,5
78824,i was happier before i knew this subculture existed,9
78825,so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10 that does nt make much sense,9
78826,how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killedhow from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human,9
78827,one of these videos was sent to me many years ago  forwarded on a myspace page  yeah  many  years ago   they were trying to  raise awareness  when they sent it to me to help the people get caught  but all they really ended up doing was spreading that ghastly thing to more points of the internet i wo nt describe a single second of it  but suffice it to say that it s horrifying i ve never been able to remove the memory i ve been through a lot in my military career  and yet seeing a 2minute version of one of those videos was easily the most horrible thing i have ever witnessed,9
78828,gt  brent justice  54  was convicted and sentenced monday for cruelty to nonlivestock animals  i guess justice has been served,9
78829,i ca nt imagine the mentality of the person making it or watching it and people get off on it    who the hell sees a cat being stabbed in the eye and thinks  hey  time to get the jergens  ,9
78830,no complaints from me but i ve noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago,9
78831,for once  reading a story of horrifying animal abuse does nt fill me with rage this must be what justice feels like finally  an appropriate sentence so sick of people like these getting slaps on the wrist due to inadequate animal protection laws,9
78832,i read the title then thought  hhmmm what s an animal crush video   who would have thunk it  animal crush videos are videos of animals getting crushed there goes some of the little remaining faith i had in humanit,9
78833,psa  if for some reason you come here first  and you do nt know what crush videos are  please do nt look them up,8
78834,i m not saying this is nt some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder,9
78835,who the fuck beats off to animals being killed  what the fuc,7
78836,i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens wtfi just dont understan,8
78837,houston man is trying to compete with florida man  and this is definitely an act i hope florida man does nt try to top,8
78838,there are some very fucked up people in this world to me  it is inconceivable how someone does this,8
78839,only 10 minutes in  and i ve already had enough reddit for today,6
78840,gt  investigators said justice filmed a scantily clad richards  sometimes masked  stabbing animals  including a puppy  a kitten and a chicken  as well as chopping off their limbs and urinating on them while making sexual comments to the camera  what the actual fuck,6
78841,you know when you really  really wish you had nt read the article linked to  this is one of those times right now,7
78842,you can kill your spouse  drunk drive and kill 4 people  steal millions of dollars from the american people  or molest dozens of children in a church of a period of 30 years and literally get less jail time when we say we love our doggos  and kittys   we fucking mean it,6
78843,i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective it was the first exposure i d ever had to this subculture  crush fetish   after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals  their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse that s all i have to say about that,1
78845,as someone who just for the first time heard the term animal crush videos  i wash that i had nt something is seriously wrong with you if this is what gets you off,7
78846,well that just ruined my da,6
78847,i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed ,4
78848,fuck people are fucked,5
78849,if slaughter houses had glass walls  everyone would quit eating animals the cognitive dissonance in here is incredible,5
78850,i definitely think this guy should be punished and i m glad he was punished  but it blow my mind how a guy like this can get 50 years and a pedophile or rapist can get 1020 or less,5
78851,i do nt understand how the sicko who did the maiming and killing gets 10 years  but the man who filmed it gets 50 that woman should not see light ever again,1
78854,gt   the order is vague and because it imposes disproportionate  intrusive  and punitive measures against households and businesses with   no due process     did nt see that one coming,9
78855,isps do nt actually want to spy on their customers like that it costs more money to put systems in place to do so and to maintain and operate those systems on top of that  it will only bring them bad press that could piss off customers  cox is basically saying  fuck you i m not taking a significant financial hit to spy on our customers so you can sue them and make money for yourself  they are doing the right thing  and the right thing also happens to be in their best business interest,9
78856,good guy cox  not selling out their customers  they actually have super reliable internet no outages in any of my apartments so far,9
78857,so to sum that up we do nt have to worry about any cox blocking,9
78858,that s nice  but i m still going to run a vpn,8
78859,all in all i ve been pretty happy with cox as an isp i ve used them in two different cities and it s always been reliable and fast i pay for 300mbps service and always get those speeds  usually higher almost no outages they re putting in 1gbs service in many of their cities right now  including mine  my biggest gripe with them is they have a soft data cap of 2 tb for my tier they do not enforce the caps at all but the fact that they exist means they are probably toying with the idea and there would be nothing to stop them from going evil since they are a monopoly like every other major isp it s like a benevolent dictatorship  http  wwwspeedtestnetmyresult5089441276 that s with a netflix stream going on in another room right now,9
78860,this must be a new thing many a year s ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did nt even know what that was  none of us knew what that even was and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi,7
78861,i ve been really happy with cox for an isp both personally and professionally here in okc personally  out of nowhere they bumped my at home connection from 15mbit to 100mbit and my bill  went down  30  all out of nowhere  without me saying a word internet is always up  not throttled  and they have decent support if it s needed  professionally at my job i ran in ip phone deployment with them for our main office  3 satellite offices they were there 100  of the way i have personal names and numbers to call in the event of issues outside of the scope of my support as the companies it admin  and when we ve needed someone on site to climb a pole for instance their longest response time was 45 minutes  i know this sounds like rhailcorporate but the fact is out of all the isps i ve had  comcast  qwest  charter  etc  they ve been the best that s not saying they should nt and could nt be better  but they re angels next to the others  in fact they proactively contact me at work every once and awhile to check on things which i greatly appreciate and they bring us cookies every month yes  our isp brings yes cookies no  we re not a big company 9 employees they re just nice,8
78862,basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum,8
78863,i used to work for cox in the field and inside cox did have a department that would monitor massive down loading and uploading but they did away with it shortly after i got there  within a year cox ca nt afford to lose customers right now so it s no surprise they are nt allowing this if they did then they would go out of business from customer loss i survived their huge layoff and realignment,5
78864,this is nothing new from cox i have had cox internet for over 10 years and worked for them a few years ago they have always had this attitude toward it s customers the customer pays for internet access  cox provides internet access they do nt even enforce data caps  at least in oklahoma   i have received a few emails due to using so much data suggesting that i switch to a business plan to maximize my speed  but have never been charged extra or cut off due to exceeding a data cap,7
78865,gt  last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers  what the actual fucking fuck,6
78866,as a customer this is the first good thing i ve ever heard from cox,4
78867,not true from my experience,3
78868,i ve had them as an isp for several years and they re excellent i did have one month where i went over my allowed bandwidth limit  300 gb on a 50 mbps down plan   and all i got was an email saying  do nt do that again   no throttling or charges or anything on 100 mbps down plan right now and i usually get 110 at least they re great  come out to me if i m having internet trouble that s not solved by online support  etc pretty good basically  i love cox and i m very satisfied with how much i get,3
78869,unrelated but i could nt stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox,3
78870,i am a proud supporter of cox,3
78871,where are all the penis jokes,3
78872,not as nice as it sounds if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do nt catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status  eg that they do nt have any liabilityresponsibility for what people use their pipe for   most carriers are  very  vested in not being the internet police,3
78873,i m guessing that if they had a way to monetize it and add to the bottom line  they d be very supportive,3
78874,when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battl,5
78875,cox is actually a familyowned business one of the major interest holders is a 96 year old woman who inherited from her father  she had been running it with her sister until her death in 2007   i happen to think they re one of the leastshady isp and cable providers out there  they also own the travel channel  which is a pretty great channel,5
78876,i thought this was talking about jesse cox,4
78877,i work for cox corporate in a startup tech company  and this makes me so happy  btw  they re just as decent an employer as they are an isp compan,3
78878,cox is spying like a champ  rest assured you have to be quite innocent or high on meth to think they have nt supplied info to big brother and his little brothers  and will not in the future,3
78879,yells loudly  i will not    whispers  if you need me too,1
78880,on that headline alone  i thought jessie cox was asked to spy on his youtube subs  was very confused for a little bit,1
78881,i knew he was my favorite eagl,1
78882,well that s one bit of good news from cox now if they d stop raising my rates every few months,1
78883,damn  i wish i had cox i have time warner and i m on my 3rd notice to stop torrenting i do nt know if they ll actually pull the plug  they re charging me out the ass already since they re the only provider in my area,1
78884,fuck yea cox   comcast   1  co,1
78885,cox  and to some extent time warner  are cable companies all cable companies fuck you in the ass  these two have the decency to spit on it first i at the very least get what i pay for with both of them,1
78886,they sent me a few emails in the past  so i got a vpn i will still use it  but good on cox for not being dickbags,1
78887,they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jone,1
78888,i had cox for 3 years service was good  and over that 3 years  doubled my download speeds twice no extra cost upload was still garbage  but hey 10015 internet for  65 a month was still pretty killer i have 7575 fios now,1
78889,almost every single person in my area that has gone to atamp  t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable  they have some shit with them but it s far less shit than others,1
78890,they re my isp and even though they re the only isp in my city besides att and verizon  they ve been awesome,1
78891,the shifting of blame to continue  going after johns and endusers has never worked,1
78892,ho yeah  today is a good day to have cox  teehee,1
78893,horseshit they cut off our internet because someone was downloading something like a year ago they re the best isp i ve ever used  but they absolutely do exactly what the mpaa et al want,1
78894,between cox and cable one in both places i live  i actually like our midwest internet providers i feel bad for people getting rammed by twc and comcast we ve paid  45 for 100mbps for several years  which sounds way better than the horror stories i hear from you guys,1
78895,cause they love internet freedom  or because it costs an extra 30 cents to have an extra indian screen data at the call center for 70 an hour,1

78905,tl  dr  apple has to provide the means to extract encrypted data from the device fbi will then try to decrypt it  i assume by brute force  would would be easy for a 4digit pin   the interesting part is that the device is owned by farook s employer  the san bernardino county department of public health had they been following proper device protocol  they would already have administrator access to it  this was literally government property used for terrorism  and now unsearchable not due to the  encryption  boogeyman but their own ineptitude,7
78906,gt  the judge ruled tuesday that the cupertinobased company had to provide  reasonable technical assistance  to the government in recovering data from the iphone 5c  including bypassing the autoerase function and allowing investigators to submit an unlimited number of passwords in their attempts to unlock the phone apple has five days to respond to the court if it believes that compliance would be  unreasonably burdensome  so it sounds like the government does nt think apple can bypass it for them  just make it easier for them to brute force i bet judge s ruling will hold up  too,4
78907,i have this hunch that this is all for show and that the fbi has access through the nsa to all of this stuff why would they cancel prism  it s not like your average citizen can inspect the electronic infrastructure of this country and verify that  for example  metadata collection has stopped i think after edward snowden they sat in a room and decided to keep doing it and act like they were stopping it i would  i sound like a conspiracy theorist but i really do think the risks of terrorism are so great and siphoning data so easy that they re still doing it,1
78908,apple  you are hereby ordered to factor the following data into its prime numbers  or be found in contempt,1

78932,what s bizarre is this concept of  respect  for the dead by parading the corpse around  or what s left of it after it s been embalmed that shit is just fucking weird burn it and get on with it do nt fuck up an interstate just because of your idiotic traditions,1
78933,the entitlement attitude of so many americans  gt  if it was me  i would have probably escorted this procession to the burial  your funeral escort was driving without a valid license the chp was correct to pull him over and cite him the rest of the funeral procession was free to continue on but you chose to pull over instead that was your own decision that caused you to be late the funeral  what is so aggravating to me about this is the family will file a lawsuit and probably win they will get to think they are right but they will milk the taxpayers of thousands of dollars,1
78934,got ta love reddits horrible bias with facts when it comes to the police,
78936,funny how employers get to steal from employees  and if they are caught  they simply have to repay the employee what they are owed nobody gets charged  nobody goes to jail  meanwhile  if an employee steals from an employer  they get charged  fined  and probably spend some time in jail ditto for customers who steal  i wonder why people hate the government and rich people,8
78937,hopefully australia has a similar thing to the usa where prisoners are paid like 47 cents per day,6
78938,not as bad as actual slaves that work in unpaid internships,5
78939,well  when the tpp goes through we ll all get to enjoy such working conditions  the fact of the matter is that this occurs constantly  the authorities refuse to investigate and the workers lack the leverage to bring the employers to court,1
78940,here in the us the government would go after ahmed and not see an issue with what was going on monetarily  edit  some of you really need to step away from the computer and not take this place so seriously,

78944,living in germany and studying  i m gon na pay 300   335   for the upcoming semester  these 335  also includes a public transportation ticket  which is in your student id  that allows me to take the train  bus  tram etc at any time as much as i like in my entire state  books are nt nearly as expensive as in the us  the most expensive book i bought last semester was 80   89    but  seriously  95  of the content for the majority of the courses are uploaded on the university s website  files and documents which you can download for free  also  the university canteen offers you decent food for a fair price  normally around 35   in the end my biggest expenses during my semester are the coffees i buy on campu,9
78945,i m from the uk and have lived in germany for 6 years now i came here with a 20000 gbp student loan for a 4 year degree in computer science  now i m about to start a masters in web science that will cost me about 1000 eur for the 2 year course  parttime and remote  i m also just about to get german citizenship  most germans are happy to speak english  i have a job here and although most of the company speak english they make i point of speaking german with me  and i with them  i m not very good at german but am slowly learning now after 5 years of being very lazy about learning the language it s a very hard language to learn  screw those articles   but in time you ll get used to it  i absolutely love speaking to locals in german and being understood by them  to me it s like being on another planet and finally being accepted by the local populus  good luck to anyone who wants to come over  it is a wise move  come and see me near koblenz,9
78946,a friends son went to college in switzerland  we are american  even though he paid additional fees as a non native  and had to travel back and forth to europe  he still paid less than kids who went to local colleges,9
78947,come gather around the fire and listen to a tale of a spooky and simple explanation of our increasing tuition rates in the us  the government started giving student loans kids take the debt  the schools get the money tuition prices increase because they can rely on the kids to get a gov loan take away student loans  then schools ca nt rely on this money  kids ca nt afford the jacked up tuitions  enrollments drop  schools are forced to cut tuition  now more affordable again it s the same problem with mortgage crisis  just a different industry,9
78948,it s almost as if germany sees the benefit of having a well educated work force that is not bogged down by insurmountable debt,9
78949,my college actually sodomizes me,9
78950,whereas here in the states  they will gladly charge you a  250semester parking fee and you will still not actually be guaranteed a space,8
78951,maybe i should go to germany,9
78952,currently living in germany  as an american student on an international internship  what this is nt telling you is that the uni system is significantly different my roommates  all in engineering or other sciences  study all day every day they have a month of exams coming up  and they usually have only one exam per year you fail that  you fail no assignments  projects  etc  just that exam  did i mention this was a fraternity  yeah  they do nt go to uni because everyone does it  like america they work  they get accepted  and they work even more it is nt for partying  it is nt for meeting your spouse or friends  it s for becoming the best you can be  which is how a university should be  good luck to the americans coming here thinking it s anything like the states enjoy the d  ner,9
78953,something like this gets posted everysingleweek without fail and then a bunch of americans start making hasty decisions to just go study in germany because it s  free   oh and it has been this way for years so it is nt a new thing  the german courses that you will have to take for at least a year to reach fluency are around  300 a month and noduolingo is absolutely not enough to get you to the level you need to study at university  the fees for applications are at  75 then an additional 15  for each university you apply to after the first it can go well into the hundreds  the bank account you have to open for your student visa has to have a frozen amount of at least approx   8500 this is nt to say it is impossible but do nt expect roses and rainbows and raining beer amp  wurst to await your easy university life in germany  also american universities except the few ivy leagues or outstanding schools  baby the absolute shit outta you you can pretty much sail smoothly your first two years while you get your core courses out of the way in germany  you jump right into it in german remember  a different language a crazy  difficult language at that the high school diploma is also not equivalent to the german one that allows you to study at a university the equivalent would be a plethora of ap courses with really good grades or a high school diploma plus two years of college with really good grades and then you re equivalent to a german high school graduate  you will also most likely not be able to transfer credits  german bureaucracy  a bitch you will have to have german knowledge when applying for your visas or someone to be a translator there with you  you may have to do a prep year for certain programs as well it is also very competitive to get into even these programs  i sound like fucking scrooge but i ve been through all of it as so have many people i met along the way  it is possible but it will take a lot of hard work and dedication and time that you wo nt regret  losing  because it may not work out perfectly you may get rejected you may not be accepted for that semester a lot of the popular programs have a cap so it s very restricted in terms of amount of students accepted  do nt expect germany to be a country that is just waiting and fiddling its thumbs for the americans to come and study in their unis for  free  and think that they re gon na make it easy for you it is anything but,9
78954,my american husband started learning german at the age of 26 a year later he was admitted to vet school here he s almost finished now we ve been paying 120 euros a semester i think he s the only foreign student to not drop out in his class though the drop out rate is high even for germans while he s happy he is debt free  the immense stress of having to learn a very hard subject in a foreign language and a foreign system  bureaucracy is insane here   have caused many panic attacks and one major case of depression and he has nt even started the huge final exam yet but at least we wo nt be  200k in debt when this is over,8
78955,the fee is actually 150500  per semester books inclusive because of librarys and because we live in 2016 and share digitaly public transport also free  you get 600  per month plus health care  if your parents arent rich  this will be checked by government  as student  and will have to pay back   half of that   in worst conditions after you finished  also  after 3 semesters you must have passed 23 of your finals at any time to get your  baf  g  money  but this will only be checked once no money for extra semesters of course,9
78956,in my opinion let them come here  let them study here and let them stay here if they want besides the fact that the ones who stay make up for the cost of education it is a great way of cultural exchange  it s always nice to have friends from different countries  so if you are coming to the area of n  rnberg just text me ,8
78957,currently living in duisburg  germany and studying at the university of duisburgessen   my choice   i grew up in the us  but my parents are from germany after graduating high school it became apparent that studying in germany was an opportunity that i could not pass up i chose my current uni because it has an international studies in engineering program which allows me to pursue a bachelors degree in computer engineering with the first year taught entirely in english   costs   the costs are definitively low the semester fee  including public transport  is below 300   my total living expenses are below 700  a month and that includes health insurance   my experience so far   keep in my mind i m still in my first semester  as others have mentioned before  the majority of students quit after the first year last year  the failure rate of an exam taken by 200 students was over 95   attending lectures is completely voluntary and there is one exam at the end of each course that makes up 100  of your final course grade no homework is given and you are very much on your own forcing yourself to focus and learn everyday can be a serious challenge  feel free to comment or pm with any questions,7
78958,many american students also come with very false expectations about what german university is like you have to be way more self organised and please do nt expect multiple choice tests,9
78959,we need to stop this immigration because when america sends its people  it sends unskilled people and we have to spend our money on them we are going to build a wall  get america to pay for it and make germany great again,9
78960,you can only offer something for free if you limit supply fewer germans go to college than us students   only 30  of germans ages 2534 have completed a tertiary education  which includes academic degrees and some but not all vocational programs that  s below the oecd average  and below the us 45  attainment rate for the same age group  http  wwwlatimescomlocaleducationcommunitylameedufreecollegeeducationingermanybutnotincalifornia20151029htmlstoryhtml edit  so now i am amused that many people are suggesting that fewer people should go to college in the us  presumably other people  not so much themselves they are smart   it seems like this would be a less popular proposal than promising free tuition,9
78963,its really a shame that this is even nessesar,9
78964,coulda gave that money to kany,9
78965,these responses wow,9
78966,good god rnews commentary is really descending to the level of youtube comments  get a grip you sad sods,8
78967,may god bless him he is a true patriot spend the money for the future generation through the preservation of our national treasures,9
78968,how many hellfire missiles would that buy,8
78969,this is a great thing people who are bashing him do not make much sense the monuments in dc are one of the united states  greatest treasures  and likewise they cost a lot to maintain let alone refurbish they are a public venue that is traversed by millions and are awesome to each person that visits  this guy decided to use some of his money to give back and better public places that reside in our nation capital and some see him as an asshole  it is one thing to be bitter about not having that kind of money  it is another thing to get pissed when someone with money gives back,7
78970,its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring,3
78971,good for him i remember the lincoln memorial being one of my more favorite monuments i d like to take my son there some day  so it s nice to see it will be upgraded and fixed up  to all the naysayers and negative commenters  fuck you,5
78972,in this thread hooray  what an awesome guy and  also fuck him  he should have used pennie,6
78973,how is he a philanthropist  he s giving money to statues  not to people maybe he s a philstatuist,5
78974,congratulations  you just bought  18 million worth of  charity shaming   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  aksowj8agwo ,3
78975,how dare that onepercenter not keep that money to themselves it s as if they are nt evil like sanders wants you to believ,1
78976,i think it s great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about what i do nt like is that there should nt even be an issue with funding for our monuments,4
78977,if we re committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i m all for it,1
78978,i wonder how many huge donations like this  maybe smaller  in the hundreds of thousands  have been made for national monuments pretty awesome someone did this wo reading the article  i have to imagine there s a good amount of rigmarole on the donor s end to ensure the donation goes to where the donor actually wanted govt accountability on any level in the us seems kind of weak lately,1
78979,all right  a 15000sqft exhibit room underneathkind of like the one in fallout ,3
78980,can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too,
78981,oh cool thanks  philanthropist guy,3
78982,wow  what an honorable thing to do  while 99  of people in his position would spend the money on useless crap  this guy chooses to spend his money on something so selfless and so much bigger than himself  this guy is a good 1  e,
78983,it d be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro,1
78984,that s nice for a full on rapist to do,
78985,let s laugh at people in need by blowing tens of millions on nonessential shit that basically benefits nobody in any significant way  edit  and get tax breaks from it too,1
78986,no matter what some peasant is going to whine rich guy should ve just kept his money to himself and these poors would nt even know  i thank him  i ll go to dc eventually the whiners here probably could nt afford any type of vacation  or if they could  only by living paycheck to paycheck,
78987,we are living in a new gilded age,
78988,i certainly appreciate what david has done here but  with all due respect to david  most americans would rather not see financial industry groups  like the carlyle group  suck economic resources out ofaway from most americans instead  we d prefer to pay for these efforts through widespread  robust economic opportunities and the tax contributions they make possible millions of americans and this nation have been greatly diminished as a result of the business activities of groups  like the carlyle group  over several decades  because of grotesque incomewealth inequality  the odds of seeing successful businesspeople like david rubinstein are greatly diminished he only got where he was because of the social ladder that used to exist in this nation,
78989,how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions,
78990,it s gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface themfight to take them down,
78991,those goddamn rich people are at it again  dammit if we could only find a way to tax away their wealth so we could spend it on poorly negotiated deals for mediocre roads and bridges,
78992,wow  what a waste of money,
78993,fixing stupid shit is hardly philanthropy,
78994,i m pretty sure there are roads around there that could have used that money  priorities  people,

79000,i ve never heard of court on a saturday thats pretty crazy,9
79001,the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though,9
79002,it should be interesting to see how she s ruled in cases of dui in the past,9
79003,she refused a breathalyzer meh she ll beat thi,9
79004,would nt being drunk compromise her ability to judge  how many times has she been impaired while working  should nt anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least  what should i make for dinner,9
79005,offitherrrr i am the la,9
79006,no one has mentioned this yet but she got pulled over at 8 am drinking in the morning  this judge has some problems,9
79007,rochesterian here the article failed to mention that she was also driving with 2 flat tires for who knows how long,8
79008,in fairness  if i was a judge in rochester i d need a few drinks before work too,9
79009,i drove through rochester today  has anyone ever heard of a garbage plate,9
79010,new york has pretty harsh dui laws if my memory serves me correctl,8
79011, it s fucking vodka maaaaaaaaaan    https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  r5h6ie_hd_g,8
79012,that would suck to have your case decided by a slurring women,9
79013,if i know new york this should be a nasty slap on this wrist especially for those in powerful position,7
79014,what seems to be the officer  problem,6
79015,well who s gon na judge the case now,5
79016,her judgement was impaire,6
79017,fry needs to weigh in here  http  imgurcomgvji0u,6
79018,to be clear  the fact that she refused a breathalyzer is important in many states it is treated as evidence of impairment and justification for arrest she knew that i have many friends who are criminal defense attorneys and all have told me they advise to refuse breathalyzer always  unless there is a court order  i m not familiar with ny law  but i can pretty much guarantee she will not be convicted of dui if middle classcollege kids can get out of them  a federal judge surely can since it said nothing about a field sobriety test  i assume they either did nt administer one  or they did and she did not meet criteria for impairment,5
79019,my friends mom is a judge and that lady boozes super hard and will drive her car around i have seen her come home from the bar completely in ruins at least a dozen times over the last 10 years she is fearless  we live in a small town in wisconsin with a huge police presence she knows all the officers and has never had an issue the whole situation seems completely ridiculous she gives out sentences for dui all day and then drives drunk all night oh god  the hypocrisy,5
79020,ny state troopers only care about the star program more tixarrest  promotionmoney so if they could get points on there own mother they would,5
79021,i m just amazed that our local news channel in lafayette is on the front page of reddit x,5
79022,regardless of judge plates  why shouldare judges treated any differently  if i expect to get pulled over and ticketed for 5mph over i believe a judge should too especially since they make 15 times the income,5
79023,i feel like poor judgement like this should make you not a judge anymore,4
79024,oh they decided the law applies today,5
79025,many  if not most  political figures are serious alcoholics when you combine the constant parties and  fundraisers  that they are expected to attend with the stress of the job  a lot of them end up drinking a lot,8

79043,in case you re wondering which was the worst charity in america  that would be the kids wish network  as identified in 2013 on this list  http  wwwtampabaycomamericasworstcharitie,7
79044,not good enough you do nt let con artists off the hook if they  agree  to shut down the scam these people committed fraud and belong in jail,6
79045,i do nt know how these people live with themselves,5
79046,i wonder how long it will be until they open another one,3
79047,sad that a majority of these are cancer related hopefully karma will catch up to them,3
79048,i know it is a reach but why do these people need to make high salaries it is a charity you are supposed to be doing something good for other people if pay is needed then just like congress no more than 80k you are performing a service for people  10 of those charities involve the police the nickel tin mafia have their hands in all kinds of money making rackets,1
79050,yeah  in the middle of a forest also 53 is only a little above the normal ones we get almost every day somewhere in the state,7

79053,california laughs at your pitiful magnitude 5 earthquakes,5
79054,i m in fresno amp  i felt it ,4
79055,im in east la  i didnt feel it   but watching news rite no,3
79056,we call that tuesda,3
79057,no news here only small towns in the owens valley and it was nt even a moderate temblor,1
79058,little south of fresno and was outside and my neighbor came running out  did you feel that  so we ran and looked at my pool and the water was moving  pretty cool to see that,1
79059,the big one is near and there is reason to fear,1
79060,who cares oklahoma had a 51 the other day and it was nt even anything to write home about,
79061,i moved away from california at the end of december this helps reinforce my decision as a good idea,
79063,colleges really need to stop expelling students due to these kangaroo courts  i m fine with them if it s from breaking a school infraction like alcohol on a dry campus or something of that sort but  if a student is accused of a criminal offense  let the courts deal with it and decide from there  schools are nt equipped to deal with these kinds of cases  nor should they be expected to be these are lifechanging accusations and need to be treated as such  for the benefit of both parties involved,9
79064,gt  ut investigators later decided  that the evidence supported a finding that  he  had sexually assaulted ms roe  the opposite of the conclusion reached by the more experienced detectives of the police department   the lawsuit says the dean of students then recommended he be expelled  ah but the police are looking for evidence that he did it  college tribunals assume he did and require he provide evidence that he did nt  which  typically  the accused is not allowed to present,9
79065,gt  one plaintiff is a 24yearold recent graduate  the other is a 21yearold student who is one semester away from graduating with a bachelor  s degree in physics  their lawsuits say   in the graduate  s case  he faces being banned from any ut system campus  being denied a shot at a ut graduate degree and having a notation put on his transcript   the undergrad faces expulsion in addition to the same punishments  that does nt make any sense to me why would an institution retroactively amend the transcript of someone  who already graduated  to say this person violated school policy  after graduating   this seems to be more evidence that they re trying to scapegoat the plaintiffs here i mean  if they were concerned with the alleged victim s wellbeing more than trying to look  tough on sexual assault   what is the point of amending the transcript,9
79066,who s the idiot who decided that kangaroo courts were a good idea,9
79067,are we to the point where  sexual assaultrape  almost no longer have a meaning    you getting hammered and hooking up with a hammered guy is not rape  nor is it assault he should sue her for the exact same thing,8
79068,i once saw a swedish movie called ondskan   evil  that drove me to become a lawyer today  here  https  enwikipediaorgwikievil_  2003_film   plot one of the key issues that caught my attention in this movie is the disregard of the law the school had to the protagonist s rights when he hired a lawyer  because of some grievance he had with the school  it backed off immediatly when the lawyer lay down the letter of the law to the headmaster of that educational institution in front of all his guests  in this university of texas sexual assault case  i believe imhlo  l is for legal   that the constitution sets a foundation of rules for everyone inside it s jurisdiction  and no internal policy that ut may have can go against the rules set by the us constitution everyone should enjoy the right of being innocent until proven guilty  and time and time again people are being layed off their jobs  students expelled  lives ruined because of yettobeproven  accusations  the right thing that any institution  like ut  should always do is address all cases of criminal behavior by always recognizing first the accused innocence until proven guilty in a court of law  edit  grammar,8
79069,gt  the friend said she thought the woman was conscious because  when she saw her kissing this man  she was awake and talking  the lawsuit says  so intentionally or not the woman who claimed to be assaulted is not telling the truth  editand they decided to expel him without even talking to the student his first chance to give his side was an appeal for his expulsion this is a fucking kangaroo court  edit2  the second lawsuit claims expulsion against a student was recommended without the alleged victim ever personally making a sex assault accusation  http  kxancom20160205lawsuitsagainstutallegebiasagainstmalesinsexassaultcase,9
79070,gt  the undergrad  s lawsuit says he had sex with a woman who was not a ut student after leaving a house party near campus sometime after midnight on march 6  2015 about a month later  the woman  s father called ut police and accused the man of sexually assaulting his daughter  fuck this i understand that if a woman is  actually  rapedmolestedassaulted it could be hard to come forward  but waiting a month or longer and  then  reporting it is bullshit you get raped  you report it immediately the longer you wait  the more i m going to doubt your accusation,7
79071,gt  university police never spoke to the woman the undergrad was accused of assaulting and no criminal charges were ever pursued  his lawsuit says the father  s report was referred to the ut dean of students  okay what the hell  seriously  though its this sort of thing that makes me really hate schools handling sexual assault cases on their own the police did nt even talk to the accused victim  but decided to tell the dean instead  it feels like it happens all the time when we have these alternate systems of punishment we stop treating crimes like crimes and treat them like rule infractions a rule infraction is cheating on a test an alleged assault is a crime treat it like one,7
79072,eli5 kangaroo courts thanks,8
79073,activist administrators  check lack of due process  check prohibited from legal council or cross examination of the accuser  check nothin to see here  move along people,6
79074,well  they are probably right these school kangaroo courts have demonstrated they have no respect for the privacy and rights of the accused  and are only interested in demonstrating how seriously they take sexual assault accusations,6
79075,male privilege,8
79076,the real lesson here is do nt trust anyone i certainly do nt anymore,6
79077,reddit is nt okay with witch hunts  but the university of texas and 1600s salem encourage them,7
79078,stay away from liberal colleges  they are cesspools of tumblrina ideals  i could barely stand the required diversity classes from my public university nothing but priviledge  patriarchy  and man hatin,8
79079,it seems to me that a public institution has to follow the sixth amendment  which grants  the right to a public trial without unnecessary delay  the right to a lawyer  the right to an impartial jury  and the right to know who your accusers are and the nature of the charges and evidence against you,6
79080,jane roe because jane doe would be incest,4
79081,so these students that are expelled do they have to still pay back their loans even though they do nt get a degree now and can they carry their credits over to another school or are they now worthless,5
79082,i love how at the end she implies that if there were a person punching people randomly on campus they would choose to not involve the police presumably so that the assault victims could  control their own destiny,3
79083,30 year old here  and planning on returning to school with all this insanity about social values exploding everywhere  i may just hold off a few more years and wait for school to become a profitable idea again,3
79084,gt  the university has been placed under enormous political pressure to appear tough on those accused of sexual assault  there s your problem right there how about be tough on those convicted of sexual assault and those whom the law decides are innocent be treated as such,3
79085,umso expel the drunken slut too  right  i could get behind that they both got drunk and made bad choices that reflect poorly on the school kick em both out  why only the male  did he conspire in some way to get her drunk  if they re both adults that got drunk and fucked then they re both equally guilty,7
79086,considering that almost every case of a rape accusation that s come out massively public has been shown to be fraudulent  i m reserving judgement on this one,3
79087, ut investigates more than 100 allegations of sexual assault a year  and that number is growing  liebman said   how the hell are there hundreds of allegations a year that s insane this reminds me of the play the crucible  i saw you with the devilcommunistscapitalists  homo raptorus,1
79088,damned if you do damned if you dont,1
79089,seems like the girl was so hammered that she could nt remember the sex figured it would be less shameful if she accused him of assault,1
79092,as a disgusting crime as this is  i do hope real investigative work ishas been done children are easily led and will answer questions often the way the interviewer asks it i remember a daycare couple who had a witchhunt waged against them  almost running their lives because the parents just knew they had to had been molesting their kids then they would ask the kids did mr x touch you there and the kids would say yes,9
79093,at least the article refers to this as a rape  rather than a  relationship  or  incident  like lots of others do,8
79094,why does the stock image of a gavel have a link to buy it printed on a mug  like  is anyone going to read this article and be all like  that s a nice gavel picture  i d like to drink coffee out of it ,5

79100,i am confident that six months of probation she will receive will be difficult for her ,9
79101,i ca nt fucking believe the people posting here defending this woman in a reversed situation there d just be people calling for his head and wishing he get killed in prison instead we re treated to people trying to find some way to defend or deflect the situation  wtf a boy gets raped and people think what   hurr well maybe he did it ,7

79144,damn i like me some wood in my mouth,1
79146,i hope they left quietly after looking in the window  they might enjoy this over at rwalkingdea,4
79147,pfft  what  really  happened was that the onduty cops did nt have cable at their station so they watched it through the windows,4
79148,we also fire up the surround sound amp when the walking dead comes on  but we do nt keep any windows open i wonder if the propane bomb scene is what triggered the 911 cal,4
79149, a show about firearms  more like a show about a group of survivors of a zombie apocalypse but whatever,4
79150, it was the tee vee  i m sorry it disturrrbed you now it s rather late   nurse diese,1
79151,is nt it heartwarming how tv can still bring the whole family together,1
79153,im guessing anyone who would be taken in by this has never seen doogie howse,4
79154, i m not a real doctor but i ll have a look ,3
79155,hey it worked for dicaprio,1
79156,charley bartlet,1
79158,china should just rename the street in front of the us embassy snowden ave problem solved,8
79159,here on the west coast we re already getting serious fallout from china s fucking pollution,7
79160,call their bluff fuck you  china,6
79161,just for that threat  we re gon na make the plaza address number  6489,3
79162,sure  right after they undo those artificial islands,1
79163,go invade another peaceful country  china  then blame them again,4
79164,serious fallout  like the nuclear fallout that would be spread over the entirety of the east and the pacific ocean if anyone in china decides it s time to do anything concrete against the us  we ll destroy the fucking world while laughing about it and accusing you of fault,4
79165,what are wechina s lil bitch  i dont think another country should have implications on our freedom of speech if anything this makes me want this place to be renamed,
79167,i have my own super secret private social network site that only i know about,6
79168,so  i read the article and it appears the site was not created by anonymous but anonymous advocates the site  i believe facebook could use some healthy competition  though i question how private anyone s information can be on the internet  even with encryption it seems no matter how much you try to protect someone s information online  there is always someone who  with enough time and ingenuity  can obtain it,5
79169,anyone else get the feeling this was an ad,4
79170, doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  i have watched criminal minds penelope can do it,6
79171,given the propensity of anonymous for leaking confidential and private information of people who do nt share their viewpoints  i do nt know how super private it would stay if someone expressed a contrary opinion would my belief that kanye is an immature narcissist result in release of the name and location of my virginity loss  or my 2nd grade teacher  btw  not the same person ,6
79172,i bet tom from facebook is already a membe,3
79173,gt  but unlike its competitors it doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  so how does it make money to pay for development  management  support  bandwidth  and servers  i do nt know how this shit gets reported slow news day  remember that stupid  social network  diaspora  they got global coverage about their facebook alternative i do nt think they ever even finished the product  let alone had anyone use it  must be built by the son of some important news editor who can drum up publicity this is likely the same,3
79174,so if i log into reddit on the tor network and my verification email account  if i were to use one  was anonymous  would nt that be the same thing,3
79175,facebook s shills are working overtime in this posts comments i hope this social media site becomes a viable alternative,3
79176,private social media pick one,1
79177,i love when people treat shit like this like news downvote it to where it belongs,
79178,eh  with anonymous s history of doxxing people  i rather not use anything that they have a hand i,
79179,so some social dropout  400 lb teenage hackers are going to be watching over other the private data of other people  i do nt think the anonymous group realizes how much they are despised across the internet,
79180,i would trust this site over facebook,
79182,fake it til you make it,4
79184,if you need to call a suicide hotline the va is garbage i ve used the military one source when i was having a mental breakdown one of the ladies sat on the phone with me and just talked for almost an hour here is their number 8003429647 i highly recommend it these arent va employees they are licenced counselors and dont get paid by how many calls they answer so they will take there time and make sure you are stable if you are still active duty or even reserves i believe they still do one on one counseling sessions that will not be documented in anyway so no fear of reprisal  here is another one you can call  text  or message https  wwwveteranscrisislinenetmobile  this one connects you to contracted va employees so not the ones you get normally although the same thing happens if its full  it will reroute you  that s the mobile link sorry if you need something else do nt settle for poor service get help  military crisis line through the military crisis line  a person in need can talk or chat confidentially with a trained counselor in as quickly and easily as a single phone call or click of a mouse the military crisis line  is available 247 and free for activeduty  guard and reserve members  their families and friends can be reached in the united states at 8002738255  then press 1 can be reached in europe at 0080012738255 or dsn 118  the tollfree service in europe may not be available through all carriers or in all countries  can be reached in korea at 0808 555 118 or dsn 118 can be reached in afghanistan at 00 1 800 273 8255 or dsn 111 offers confidential online chat at the military crisis line website or by texting to 838255 another edit  if anyone needs to talk please feel free to contact me shit  send me a pm and i ll give you my number and we can talk i ve lost too many friends to suicide and hate how this cycle perpetuates itself,8
79185,because america loves her servicemen and women so she wants them to help themselve,8
79186,i have been calling the helpline everyday for 2 weeks it is a recorded message saying call back later we are busy just then general va helpline,7
79187,the problem with the va  like most other government agencies  is that there is no accountability when you ca nt fire workers who are lazy  negligent  or worthless  you end up with a disfunctional organization filled with lazy  negligent  and worthless people,7
79188,yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country,4
79189,i have a pretty easy solution  why do nt overflow suicide calls just get forwarded to the regular suicide hotline  s   sure its probably better to deal with someone specifically trained to deal with service men and women but anyone is better then a voicemail,6
79190,that vm box is gon na get overloaded quic,3
79191,pissing off trained military personnel seems like a dumb idea in the long ru,3
79192,and sanders wants to make this available for everyone it s not the money that causes this agency to be this way it s the nature of the federal government,4
79193,it is nt a secret that the va is understaffed that is the biggest issue with the va and if they had more funding for labor costs  they would be in a far better spot,1
79194,i ve been getting this for over a month the one time i did connect  the estimated wait time was 55 minutes,1
79195,started up telepsyche again trying to make some progress a pending appointment looms  and i am very much looking forward to it  until she calls me and tells me they re cancelling it  i get a couple of appoints out of them  and then someone is sick  or changes positions there s no way for me to develop a healthy trusting relationship with my therapist  this is not an effective way to heal  so fuck it i ll go till i burn out in a glorious explosion of give a fucks and poop,1
79196,remember when the va story broke it was really big news and everyone was talking about it and it was front page on reddit  nothing s changed  stories keep coming out about how nothing s changed  but no one cares either because it s not new anymore  or because of politics  or maybe both i do nt know,1
79197,can anyone explain why the va is so dysfunctional  in short  i do nt get it it seems like they have tons of money but ca nt get their shit together,1
79198,tell me more about how universal healthcare will be awesome for the rest of us,
79199,socialized healthcare no thanks,
79200,governmentrun anything is a disaster,
79203,while the koches paid the mob in nevada to outlaw anything similar there or so i hypothesize,1
79205,gt  police told local media they still don  t have a motive  assisted suicide would be my be,6
79206,til that the plot for the movie hostel is honestly very probable,1
79207,my initial reaction was  what the fucking fuck     but on second thought  assisted suicide would be a reasonable motive old people with terminal diseases should nt be forced to live out their last few months or years in suffering if they do nt want to,
79208,compassionate side of me  fuuuuuuuck that s horrific  reddit side of me  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  sduux5fdys,
79210,why did nt they care this much about their freaking  home   remember all those reporters and camera crews contaminating all that evidence after the shooting it was live on cnn ffs,7
79211,i do believe they are nt understanding that the phone ca nt be decrypted by apple or anyone,7
79212,even if they wrote a program to stop the wait time or not wipe phone after a certain amount of failed attempts  you would still need to get inside the phone to implement it,3
79213,this is what the fbi was looking for  the one terrorist case it can trumpet to prove it needs to unlock anyone s phone at any time,1
79214,why not just dump the phones firmware and then brute force it there  learn2nsa fb,1
79215,under what law or authority can a third party company be compelled to take some action  other than testifying  in a criminal case  can the feds order a construction company to build a house  can they order a car manufacturer to build a custom version of a car,1
79217,never thought i would read the phrase  lab grown vaginas   but here we are,8
79218,cool all you need to do is inject stem cells onto the printed copy  implant it back into the patient and presto  no need to take antirejection meds for the rest of your life,3
79219,would it be unethical to alter the parts to improve them  or for increased aesthetic value,3
79220,i thought it said doritos 3d bo,5
79221,being in medicine  i am glad to see that this is going viral and more are being informed look how far we have come,1
79222,this ll end poorly  https  iytimgcomvi5kfcjacaeowmaxresdefaultjp,1
79224, every  prepackaged shredded cheese has it it s the most common anticlumping agent used around the world the argument is that the labels said 100  cheese,9
79225,labels should be accurate end of story if the product inside does not match the label ingredients  it is fraud and should be prosecuted as such,8
79226,that s why you buy a little wedge of parm and use a microplane grater on it to shave cheese onto your pasta the wedge lasts a very long time  and in the end it s cheaper than the nasty jars,7
79227,cellulose is the actual substance you ll find it in all pregrated cheeses these guys were just busted putting too much in to save    lettuce is also made of cellulose where commercial outfits get it for cheese  i guess could be just about any plant judged edible  including  sure  trees  also who knows what kind of cheese you re supposedly getting much nicer to get a hunk of the real stuff and a crank grater  my knuckles hate box graters with a passion ,8
79228,so my penne has wood,7
79229,so the correct labeling is 92  cheese and 8  wood filler  i think that s right,6
79230,solution  buy your parmesan  domestic or real  and grate it yourself tastes better too if you re really lazy  grate it and freeze until you need it,7
79231,damn were becoming like china  next will have faked food,6
79232,what kind of wood   are we talking the high quality organic stuff  or factory processed scrap wood  because goddamnit if they ve been slipping cheap wood shavings into my welfarecheese  we re going to have an fucking issue on our hands,4
79233,lol  wood it is cellulose trying to get clicks,6
79234,i m safe  source  only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti,3
79235,i shred my own parmesan cheese  it makes worlds differenc,3
79236,this is why i do nt buy nasty sargento cheese ever taste it  it tastes like wood  i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better,3
79237,hmm i am pretty sure i misread that title,1
79238,it s cheaper by the chunk anyways,1
79239,similar to olive oil  most parmesan cheese is nt even parmesan cheese,1
79240,my parents always called it cardboard chees,1
79241,it still taste oh so goooooooood,1
79242,if it tastes good  i do nt care,1
79243,pene means weiner in spanish that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood,1
79244,maybe they are just trying to get people to eat a whole door over the course of a year,1
79245,just buy the blockwedge and grate your own,1
79246,gt  she faces up to a year in prison  so  what re you in for blondie    just beat me up and get it over with,1
79247,cellulose is indeed an anti clumping agent if they use more and it does not change taste  i am ok with it at least it has less calories  ,
79248,if you buy preshredded or grated cheese  you deserve to eat wood,
79250,now there is a precedence i hope apple can appeal this    ,1
79251,i m 100  fine with this i ca nt believe they need apple though unless they want everything done legally,1
79253,i ve never heard of court on a saturday thats pretty crazy,9
79254,the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though,9
79255,it should be interesting to see how she s ruled in cases of dui in the past,9
79256,she refused a breathalyzer meh she ll beat thi,9
79257,would nt being drunk compromise her ability to judge  how many times has she been impaired while working  should nt anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least  what should i make for dinner,9
79258,offitherrrr i am the la,9
79259,no one has mentioned this yet but she got pulled over at 8 am drinking in the morning  this judge has some problems,9
79260,rochesterian here the article failed to mention that she was also driving with 2 flat tires for who knows how long,8
79261,in fairness  if i was a judge in rochester i d need a few drinks before work too,9
79262,i drove through rochester today  has anyone ever heard of a garbage plate,9
79263,new york has pretty harsh dui laws if my memory serves me correctl,8
79264, it s fucking vodka maaaaaaaaaan    https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  r5h6ie_hd_g,8
79265,that would suck to have your case decided by a slurring women,9
79266,if i know new york this should be a nasty slap on this wrist especially for those in powerful position,7
79267,what seems to be the officer  problem,6
79268,well who s gon na judge the case now,5
79269,her judgement was impaire,6
79270,fry needs to weigh in here  http  imgurcomgvji0u,6
79271,to be clear  the fact that she refused a breathalyzer is important in many states it is treated as evidence of impairment and justification for arrest she knew that i have many friends who are criminal defense attorneys and all have told me they advise to refuse breathalyzer always  unless there is a court order  i m not familiar with ny law  but i can pretty much guarantee she will not be convicted of dui if middle classcollege kids can get out of them  a federal judge surely can since it said nothing about a field sobriety test  i assume they either did nt administer one  or they did and she did not meet criteria for impairment,5
79272,my friends mom is a judge and that lady boozes super hard and will drive her car around i have seen her come home from the bar completely in ruins at least a dozen times over the last 10 years she is fearless  we live in a small town in wisconsin with a huge police presence she knows all the officers and has never had an issue the whole situation seems completely ridiculous she gives out sentences for dui all day and then drives drunk all night oh god  the hypocrisy,5
79273,ny state troopers only care about the star program more tixarrest  promotionmoney so if they could get points on there own mother they would,5
79274,i m just amazed that our local news channel in lafayette is on the front page of reddit x,5
79275,regardless of judge plates  why shouldare judges treated any differently  if i expect to get pulled over and ticketed for 5mph over i believe a judge should too especially since they make 15 times the income,5
79276,i feel like poor judgement like this should make you not a judge anymore,4
79277,oh they decided the law applies today,5
79278,many  if not most  political figures are serious alcoholics when you combine the constant parties and  fundraisers  that they are expected to attend with the stress of the job  a lot of them end up drinking a lot,8
79279, spits out drink   it s fucking vodka man ,7
79282,gt  purchase orders showing that the sheriff s office spent more than  60000 on barbecue grills wtf why,9
79283,this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties the docs and comments on the forum board are searing i would imagine many itinformation systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments,8
79284,i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever,8
79285,cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification  one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry,5
79286,they re public officials and public servants  appointedhiredelected we re entitled to see what these records are  without exception,8
79287,as much as i m for police transparency  i m not for their home addresses being out there that puts their families and neighbors at risk,8
79288,i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered,8
79289,anything worth even looking at in this release,3
79290,do nt know why they re concerned  surely they have nothing to hide ,5
79291,if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear,1
79292,good anytime somebody s falsely charged with shit their life is dragged through the mud in the papers  let the pigs have the same,
79293,you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings,1
79294,notice that hackers never dox the 01   billionaires sponsoring hillary clinton  etc,1
79295,you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced  well fuck it no more police and no more rules    fucking stupid juveniles,
79296,umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops there s hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops,
79300,they do not care what police do with them  they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them  edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create  that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all  they do not care about you you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle,8
79301,why this has 58 upvotes when some stupid shit about a teen  affluenza  case has 4000  i can not fathom priorities  people,7
79302,where is the tipping point for police state,7
79303,the stingray is just one of  many   https  theinterceptcomsurveillancecatalogue  devices used by our governmental police agencies against us,8
79304,good ole harris  i m glad they have branched out from raking the military over the coals for their radios and now get the law enforcement agencies for the stingray,4
79305,alex jones brought this up long ago  yet hes a kook though right,1
79306,what is the point of all this secrecy  this stuff always comes out,1
79308,i lived 200yds from a burn pit when i was there in 04 i had some skin disease for about 2 years after iraq and some kind of asthma the va did nt give a shit then and they still do nt care  so  i got that goin for me,9
79309,i was in tikrit  cob speicher  from 08 to 09 i lived a few hundred feet from the  burn pit  it was basically a huge junk yard with 3 huge constantly burning rectangular pits they were about 75 feet long and 50 feet across iirc you could see black or white smoke billowing from the area all the time i had to go there at least once a week to dump trash imagine standing over a red hot fire throwing junk off the back of a flatbed truck while it was 130 degrees outside sometimes the smog was so thick driving through the junk yard  that you could nt see 50 feet in front of you the smoke would almost always linger around the base and it smelled awful olfactory fatigue did not apply here it always smelled no matter how long you d be  exposed  you never got used to it never mind that they burned our shit right next door i remember one day we had to do a pt test the 2 mile run was on the same road as the burn pit smoke everywhere nobody passed that day some people were puking at the end i usually ran a 13  45 2 mile and i remember getting over 17 minutes i was gasping for air at the end we all thought the course was marked out incorrectly  but when we measured it later that day it was exactly 2 miles needless to say  nobody ever had any respiratory protection around these things  ever nor were we ever told we needed them i mean we had our gas masks in our gear  but nobody wanted to be  that guy  damn  we used to joke about it all the time whenever someone would start spewing some  war story   or when some freshoutabasic private would try to tell us about  that one time my drill sergeant made us do this  story   at the end we d say   yeah  but have you ever been to the burn pit    then we d laugh it off i guess it s not so funny anymore,8
79310,my husband  half  jokes about the cancer he s going to get from the burn pits in afghanistan from what he described  they were horrible,7
79311,this hits close to home we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight i really need to get this checked out,7
79312,i can understand why burning trash and human waste may be unavoidable in certain military circumstances like in those remote outposts in afghanistan that might house 1520 people  there really are nt any good alternatives  however it seems less defensible to not have invested in better infrastructure once you had permanent bases the size of small cities  once you re at the point where soldiers had their own little airconditioned houses made out of cargo containers with air conditioning  satellite television  and onbase burger king it seems like you can probably invest in some proper trash incinerators instead of open burn pits,7
79313,gt  though the us government disputes it well  color me surprised,8
79314,a tsgt i know died recently from cancer he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family he was 32 his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer,7
79315, support our troops with a ribbon sticker   that will definitely make up for all the fucked up shit the government puts them through,7
79316,not surprised saw a guy in the va who used to jog through the base with his unitteam  not sure of the terminology   breathing in the smoke from one of these every day for 4 years he had some chronic lung condition we were working up  and said a couple of his buddies also have lung problems now otherwise perfectly healthy 40 years old  completely unnecessary illness due to stupidity andor apathy,6
79317,http  wwwpublichealthvagovexposurescamplejeune for decades  the government knowingly allowed service members and their dependents to consume contaminated tap water fifteen diseases are recognized to have a direct relation to the contamination but many more are cropping up yet the government wo nt recognize those  yet   and they re filing motions to have claims tossed out based on statute of limitations  even though the government did nt even announce the contamination until over a decade after the wells were closed  this is nt just an agent orange or iraq war contamination where soldiers were exposed and have problems babies born at the base hospital hadhave an alarmingly high rate of birth defects but nothing is being done about it and the va continues to deny claims we ll just go ahead and add this one to the list,6
79318,uhh i ve had a severe cough for 34 years now  since coming back from afghanistan  it ll get so bad  that i ll cough until i throw up  and then cough more  the va said it was normal i m sure they know what they re talking about i feel fine,6
79319,i remember having to sit through a 2 hour briefing the first week i arrived in iraq  back in 2008 we were told that scientists verified that the burn pit on base was not a detriment to our health  then we had to sign forms when i returned stateside  there were quite a few reports of people having respiratory issues after returning from deployment  the va also denied that any illnesses were related to desert storm it took a long time for anyone other than veterans to admit that desert storm syndrome was a real thing  and then said veterans had to go through the gauntlet of proving their illnesses were related to their deployment,7
79320,goddamn  it s unbelievable the way vets are treated shame,6
79321,government does nt give a fuck about veterans,5
79322,my 36yo buddy was just diagnosed with nonhodgkens lymphoma when he visited the va to do the paperwork they asked what bases he served at overseas  and literally had a list of diseases to reference per base just got a  yep  here it is probably from the burn pit  from the clerk thumbing down the list when he told me i was blown away  why is nt there any followup with soldiers who served at these bases    even a simple  you may want to get screened  when he returned from service would have given us some hope of getting in front of it it s incredibly irritating,5
79323,the us lying about iraq and afghanistan  nah  never happen,7
79324,do nt worry guys we ll take care of your medical needs when you come home oh wait,5
79325,do nt forget area 51 they had burn pits like you would nt believe stealth materiels that had top secret components in them the poor guys that were exposed to all of this could nt even go for help  many died in secrecy  i know i was exposed to vaporized depleted uranium and who knows what else i have a sort of bet with my self that i ll die an early death,5
79326,so  the dod did nt learn any lessons from previous burn pits  i mean  when you have to declassify area 51 because of workers health decline due to burn pits  you d think you d remember this shit is wrong,5
79327, though he returned home safely in september 2009  he woke up one day a few months later with an inexplicable headache  numbness in his limbs and paralysis on one side of his body beau had suffered a mild stroke his health deteriorated  and he was diagnosed with brain cancer less than two years later  he died at the age of 46  holy fuck    fuck wars and politicians that start them,4
79328,the us govt so cares about its troops,7
79329,i ve known military to have permanent letters added to their medical records saying they have been exposed to the worst man made hazarddisaster since chernobyl,4
79330,does kaf still have the shit pond  on another note  im going to have this checked out the va has this on their website somewhere  they sent an email,4
79331,there are so many things wrong with this i do nt even know what to say  let s just purposefully burn hazardous material  petroleum products  chemicals  and batteries next to our camp oh  and throw some explosives in there while you re at it and vaporizes all that shit so we can breath it in are you kidding me,4
79332,holy shit  my friend who was on the poop burning detail a bunch of times died of throat cancer earlier this year my first thought was it was the poop burning that did it  and i m concerned as well because i did my fair share of that as well,4
79333,where we lived there was a burn pit that was nearby and the smoke would always float over to where we were  as of yet i dont have any symptoms but i do have a begine growth in my head  i have had it checked but i am paranoid that it could become bad ,4
79334,little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did nt have to bother to actually lob chemicalbio weapons at us we d send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chembio bomb themselves  did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney,4
79335,every time i allow myself a shred of regret for not enlisting  i remind myself that this kind of shit is what the us does to its soldiers fuck that i respect your service and all that  but fuck that shit,1
79336,every goddamn war the military has to do something that exposes troops to dangerous chemicals,3
79337,makes me wonder  i was at camp addertallil back in 2010  2011  what was i exposed to,3

79347,my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well,1
79348,that was one messy cakewalk,5
79349,they should turn on the masters and their supporters,3
79350,so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them,3
79351,i thought iraq did nt have wmd s,4
79352,be sure and vote gop they re the gift that keeps on giving   you give cancer to the army you have  not the army you wish you had,1
79353,such a simple solution  rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacement,
79354,am i the only one who read that at first as burn pit bulls,
79356,colleges really need to stop expelling students due to these kangaroo courts  i m fine with them if it s from breaking a school infraction like alcohol on a dry campus or something of that sort but  if a student is accused of a criminal offense  let the courts deal with it and decide from there  schools are nt equipped to deal with these kinds of cases  nor should they be expected to be these are lifechanging accusations and need to be treated as such  for the benefit of both parties involved,9
79357,gt  ut investigators later decided  that the evidence supported a finding that  he  had sexually assaulted ms roe  the opposite of the conclusion reached by the more experienced detectives of the police department   the lawsuit says the dean of students then recommended he be expelled  ah but the police are looking for evidence that he did it  college tribunals assume he did and require he provide evidence that he did nt  which  typically  the accused is not allowed to present,9
79358,gt  one plaintiff is a 24yearold recent graduate  the other is a 21yearold student who is one semester away from graduating with a bachelor  s degree in physics  their lawsuits say   in the graduate  s case  he faces being banned from any ut system campus  being denied a shot at a ut graduate degree and having a notation put on his transcript   the undergrad faces expulsion in addition to the same punishments  that does nt make any sense to me why would an institution retroactively amend the transcript of someone  who already graduated  to say this person violated school policy  after graduating   this seems to be more evidence that they re trying to scapegoat the plaintiffs here i mean  if they were concerned with the alleged victim s wellbeing more than trying to look  tough on sexual assault   what is the point of amending the transcript,9
79359,who s the idiot who decided that kangaroo courts were a good idea,9
79360,are we to the point where  sexual assaultrape  almost no longer have a meaning    you getting hammered and hooking up with a hammered guy is not rape  nor is it assault he should sue her for the exact same thing,8
79361,i once saw a swedish movie called ondskan   evil  that drove me to become a lawyer today  here  https  enwikipediaorgwikievil_  2003_film   plot one of the key issues that caught my attention in this movie is the disregard of the law the school had to the protagonist s rights when he hired a lawyer  because of some grievance he had with the school  it backed off immediatly when the lawyer lay down the letter of the law to the headmaster of that educational institution in front of all his guests  in this university of texas sexual assault case  i believe imhlo  l is for legal   that the constitution sets a foundation of rules for everyone inside it s jurisdiction  and no internal policy that ut may have can go against the rules set by the us constitution everyone should enjoy the right of being innocent until proven guilty  and time and time again people are being layed off their jobs  students expelled  lives ruined because of yettobeproven  accusations  the right thing that any institution  like ut  should always do is address all cases of criminal behavior by always recognizing first the accused innocence until proven guilty in a court of law  edit  grammar,8
79362,gt  the friend said she thought the woman was conscious because  when she saw her kissing this man  she was awake and talking  the lawsuit says  so intentionally or not the woman who claimed to be assaulted is not telling the truth  editand they decided to expel him without even talking to the student his first chance to give his side was an appeal for his expulsion this is a fucking kangaroo court  edit2  the second lawsuit claims expulsion against a student was recommended without the alleged victim ever personally making a sex assault accusation  http  kxancom20160205lawsuitsagainstutallegebiasagainstmalesinsexassaultcase,9
79363,gt  the undergrad  s lawsuit says he had sex with a woman who was not a ut student after leaving a house party near campus sometime after midnight on march 6  2015 about a month later  the woman  s father called ut police and accused the man of sexually assaulting his daughter  fuck this i understand that if a woman is  actually  rapedmolestedassaulted it could be hard to come forward  but waiting a month or longer and  then  reporting it is bullshit you get raped  you report it immediately the longer you wait  the more i m going to doubt your accusation,7
79364,gt  university police never spoke to the woman the undergrad was accused of assaulting and no criminal charges were ever pursued  his lawsuit says the father  s report was referred to the ut dean of students  okay what the hell  seriously  though its this sort of thing that makes me really hate schools handling sexual assault cases on their own the police did nt even talk to the accused victim  but decided to tell the dean instead  it feels like it happens all the time when we have these alternate systems of punishment we stop treating crimes like crimes and treat them like rule infractions a rule infraction is cheating on a test an alleged assault is a crime treat it like one,7
79365,eli5 kangaroo courts thanks,8
79366,activist administrators  check lack of due process  check prohibited from legal council or cross examination of the accuser  check nothin to see here  move along people,6
79367,well  they are probably right these school kangaroo courts have demonstrated they have no respect for the privacy and rights of the accused  and are only interested in demonstrating how seriously they take sexual assault accusations,6
79368,male privilege,8
79369,the real lesson here is do nt trust anyone i certainly do nt anymore,6
79370,reddit is nt okay with witch hunts  but the university of texas and 1600s salem encourage them,7
79371,stay away from liberal colleges  they are cesspools of tumblrina ideals  i could barely stand the required diversity classes from my public university nothing but priviledge  patriarchy  and man hatin,8
79372,it seems to me that a public institution has to follow the sixth amendment  which grants  the right to a public trial without unnecessary delay  the right to a lawyer  the right to an impartial jury  and the right to know who your accusers are and the nature of the charges and evidence against you,6
79373,jane roe because jane doe would be incest,4
79374,so these students that are expelled do they have to still pay back their loans even though they do nt get a degree now and can they carry their credits over to another school or are they now worthless,5
79375,i love how at the end she implies that if there were a person punching people randomly on campus they would choose to not involve the police presumably so that the assault victims could  control their own destiny,3
79376,30 year old here  and planning on returning to school with all this insanity about social values exploding everywhere  i may just hold off a few more years and wait for school to become a profitable idea again,3
79377,gt  the university has been placed under enormous political pressure to appear tough on those accused of sexual assault  there s your problem right there how about be tough on those convicted of sexual assault and those whom the law decides are innocent be treated as such,3
79378,umso expel the drunken slut too  right  i could get behind that they both got drunk and made bad choices that reflect poorly on the school kick em both out  why only the male  did he conspire in some way to get her drunk  if they re both adults that got drunk and fucked then they re both equally guilty,7
79379,considering that almost every case of a rape accusation that s come out massively public has been shown to be fraudulent  i m reserving judgement on this one,3
79380, ut investigates more than 100 allegations of sexual assault a year  and that number is growing  liebman said   how the hell are there hundreds of allegations a year that s insane this reminds me of the play the crucible  i saw you with the devilcommunistscapitalists  homo raptorus,1
79381,damned if you do damned if you dont,1
79382,seems like the girl was so hammered that she could nt remember the sex figured it would be less shameful if she accused him of assault,1
79385,thats bad news for all the 711 in our town that take the,8
79386,does nt this just translate into fewer places for poor people to buy food,7
79387, 711 cashiers will now have to ring up cigarettes as organic kale instead of hot pockets,7
79388,on the other hand  if the business stops taking food stamps entirely  not only can they not get the kale you want to make them eat  but they also ca nt get a loaf of bread or gallon of milk unless they start selling their food stamps to get cash to buy the milk and bread so the business still makes their money  the amount of food stamp fraud goes up  and the poor that you claim to be helping are getting even less food  healthy or otherwise  because of the food stampcash exchange rate,4
79389,why are nt food stamps like wic  with wic you get vouchers for specific food items these items cover the basic food groups and align with a certain amount of nutritional value  meanwhile  you can buy friggin monster energy drinks with food stamps that makes no sense  regardless if you are looking at it from a healthy standpoint or a taxpayer standpoint,6
79390,if obesity and other nutrition related issues are such a problem among the poor  would nt it be more cost effective to do away with food stamps and implement something like a food box program instead  in other words would the cost of labor to package and ship prepared food boxes in bulk to grocery stores and distribution centers be offset by what would be saved in reduced healthcare costs  imagine a program where you list the people in your household  any allergies or specific requirements and a box is prepared to supplement your family for a week it could contain things like rice  beans  canned or pouched goods like meats  vegetables and fruits  dried oatmeal and cereals  powdered milk  cooking oil every month they could receive a selection of 5 spices  salt and pepper and even a recipe pamphlet if in addition to the box  they started a program where grocery stores and produce growers could drop off older or bruised produce  people could pick some up for free when they picked up their boxes,7
79391,what if the healthy foods do nt sell  are they still forced to stock them  would nt you think the actual grocers in the neighborhood would have a better sense of what their customers want than the federal government,4
79392,no they ll stop or pack up and leave  ahhhincentives,5
79393,you can lead them to water  but you ca nt make them drin,5
79394,we have jackinthebox here in phoenix that has we accept ebt  signs up all over pisses me off  same thing at the gas station when you see children without any parents around loading up on overpriced candy and soda and  sure enough  out comes the ebt card or even worse is when they are  with  the adult and loading up on dog shit  food stamps should only be foractual food,1
79395,honestly this will be great  the state  should  be very involved in what people eat for free,1
79396,another  good intention  bad policy,1
79397,this is the dark side of welfare  the constitution is completely circumvented the government has the power to cajole and pressure when it is putting stipulations on the money it gave out the government is capable of doing things it would never have the power of doing otherwise  like forcing a business to carry certain products  or forcing a person to apply for jobs or eventually  forcing people to work at government labor jobs,1
79398,because dontravious demands fresh cilantro,3
79399,i wonder how much crime in a store would go down if the store was no longer food stamp approved,1
79402,once the cop shows up to your convenience store robbery  it s time to call it quits  what the fuck did he think he was getting away with,9
79403,good on his father for turning in his son for this crime that cant be an easy thing to do but he did the right thing,9
79404,father of five  damn best wishes to officer couch and his loved ones,8
79405,sounds like he may make it gt   he s doing as good as can be expected   couch s father  alozo hardiman  told the station  it s touch and go we are praying for him and god knows best,7
79406,i believe we have gangs that are setting these kids up with a hair trigger  and along comes a cop that sets them off  we need to get to the root problem as well as locking up the kids,7
79407,that fucker is 19  looks 3,7
79408,i hope the cop gets better,7
79409,dont ever let this shithead have an ounce of freedo,8
79410,how does a bullet fragment if it enters through the eye,6
79411,he s a really meanlooking kid  i do nt know if he always wears that scowl  or if it s just for the mugshot,5
79412,19 years old and your life s over for the contents of a cash register justwhy,3
79413,wish people would stop shooting cops it s making them all scared and trigger happy,1
79414,kinda looks like trayvon martin and mike brown had a kid,1
79415,where s all the blm people now  i mean it s a black cop and all conflict of interest  or does nt fit your super combo of white cop and dead black kid,
79416,i do nt understand reddit says that loggers and farmers have more dangerous jobs,
79417,another prime blm example,
79418,hope he gets a fair trial y,
79419,so this guy is innocent until proven guilty right  why is this investigation so short  we do nt know the details  why does it take a year to investigate an officer for shooting someone  and this takes a couple of days to charge this guy  is that disconnect enough to make anyone here question things enough to accept that there is a massive encompassing problem with our legal system  i always have to wonder because we see many of the same people calling for people to wait for details after an officer shoots someone  telling us not to be monday morning quarterbacks then stories like this pop up and we have those same people frothing at the mouth in this situation where it has nt been given the year plus of investigation that an officer who shoots someone would be given the guy is already guilty despite the cries to give officers the benefit of the doubt because of the innocent until proven principle,
79420,how the hell do you survive a gunshot to the face  that s some 50 cent shit,
79421,this thread https  wwwredditcomraskredditcomments460zpfwithout_insulting_anyone_what_would_you_say_tod01ln3,
79422,it s about damn time we made sure innocent good people had guns and training and could defend themselves   or we could stop giving guns to everybody gee i do nt know,
79423,maybe the cop was making furtive movements,
79429, men who might be in their 30 s   real helpful description,7
79430,i got hit by a car in a parking lot once i punched the car really hard just so the driver realized he was hitting me it had nothing to do with challenging the driver to a fight or whatever,5
79432,this makes sense a lot of people in science fields relating to cancer formation  such as radiology and medicinal biology  are of the opinion that most cancerous tumors are actually quietly killed by the body before they can reach critical mass to defend themselves  and the ones that prove dangerous are the ones that either do nt register to t cells or which grow too quickly to be snuffed to simplify  the reasons for this are simple  not everyone dies from cancer  and everyone gets exposed to carcinogens given the rate of mutation  the influence of radiation  the amount of background radiation  etc  that everyone is unavoidably exposed to  we should all develop tumors if there is a true casual relationship if you simply say that the body is helpless against them naturally  we would all die from cancer the body  must  be defending itself from them given that we do nt  in fact  it s basically accepted as scientific truth cancer is nt simply the presence of cancerous tumors  it s the presence of cancerous tumors that have the right surrounding cells  in the right quantity  that do nt die from immune system intervention and which have favorable growth conditions most small tumors simply do nt have the right conditions  and die studies have confirmed that the ones that register as cancer are a subset of all tumors that might form  because this subset avoids the usual limiting factors  so  going back to the article  this is simply taking the bodies natural process for fighting tumors and guiding it to specific cancers it might normally miss and saying  go get it   then praying you did nt just kill the poor sap with his now manically overenthusiastic immune system,6
79433,gt  the treatment involves removing the tcells from patients  tagging them with  receptor  molecules that target cancer  and putting them back into the body in an infusionthe targeting molecules  known as chimeric antigen receptors or cars  came from specially bred genetically engineered mice   gt  in one study  94 percent of participants suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia  all  said their symptoms vanished completely after they were treated with the modified blood cells  known as tcells  it looks like this could be a very  very big deal i m surprised that  as of this comment  this post is not getting much attention,7
79434,now they just need to find a way to reverse liver cirrhosis and i can live forever,1
79435,this is a breakthrough right up until the pharmaceutical companies buy the process and tuck it away forever  there s no money to be made in curing a disease,1
79436,i m rather hopeful that we ll be able to cure most cancers within the next 20 years or so  and hopefully before that we ll have something that wo nt cure it but will reliably halt cancer so that a patient can just wait for the actual cure to be found  as with we do with hiv i believe  maybe i m being too optimistic  but you got ta be optimistic about something in this miserable world,1
79438,14 billion years    so what am i suppose to tell them when i get called in for a tax audit 15 billion years from now and my records only go back 14 billion years,7
79439,another  holographic storage  for us to hear about for 20 years that wo nt materialize in our lifetimes it s a bummer  removable archival media seems like it is really stagnant,6
79440,yes  but will there be a  reader  for that disc in 14 billion years,6
79441,i always love when brand new technologies claim forever,4
79442,cool  take all of humankind  audio  video and written text  and burn it to a couple of discs store several copies of it on the moon  along with a radio beacon should humanity get wiped out  we ll have left something for future generations to discover  no need to build giant pyramids,4

79446,when can i buy a burner  i have to move onto my next project  archiving the world s vast array of porn,
79448,yes please too big to fail means they are too big  period break them apart,8
79449,this seems like a no brainer not saying it will be easy  but why ever have banks too large to fail even exist,9
79450,absolutely agree  but it will likely go nowhere it really is nt any different than when the government stepped in and broke up atamp  t into the baby bells unfortunately  this is talk by those who have no power to enforce change,6
79451,seems like a good move if you re too big to fail  you are clearly in violation of antitrust and monopoly legislation  surely  plus  anything that is too big to fail is clearly just a bad idea from the standpoint of a societies ability to sustain unexpected shocks and surprises,7
79452,big banks and wall street bank elections for both parties not going to happen unless supreme court reverses  citizens united  ruling allowing corporations to donate unlimited amount of funds to politicians and political parties as long as such bribery is legal  no politician will bite the hand that feeds himher,4
79453,this is a political talking point floated to make sanders look like an over reactor if andor when he loses the nomination this guy and his idea will disappear from sight,5
79454,hopefully  his floating that idea wo nt end up with him floating in the river,4
79455,kashkari  eh  so  how does goldman sachs make money off of this,4
79456,eh  wake me when they actually start breaking them up for now this is just more idle talk,4
79457,i guess they could nt find a picture that makes him look crazier,4
79458,if there are any economists here  i have a question how do we know that this wo nt have the same results as breaking up telecoms  regional monopolies collude until one is more successful and one starts to fail the successful one buys the failing one then this process repeats until the most successful one is enormous again  but with writeoffs  layoffs and debts thanks to the less successful ones consumers get screwed by footing the bill for the whole failed experiment  if telecoms can do that  why would we assume that banks wo nt just do the same thing  to the effect of even more pain for consumers,4
79459,oh hey  it s the guy who ran for california governor,3
79460,news update  spontaneous fires erupt in rome,3
79461,no if we break up banks or make them have more capital  they will invest less  and folks on reddit will say its too hard to get a loan the banks will now actually want to make sure folks can actually pay back the loan  and a lot of folks have no assets  and will cry its not fair   only the rich are getting the loans    since they already have assets   are you sure you want to hold banks accountable  personally  i think its a great idea  but not sure you all realize the banks will just push that accountability back on you,3
79462,that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money,1
79463,probably not that big of a problem anymore they ve plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 20 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become,1
79464,looks as though he s beginning a political career as a goldman  fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him asshole,1
79465,breaking up huge banks reduces the chance that banks will get the giant bailouts the did after 2008 failures  massive corporate welfare they will lobby hard against the potential loss of a free ride,1
79466,godless commie socialism yes pleas,1
79467, flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca nt fail  did anyone else see this   wtf  so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further,1
79468,trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it,1
79469,from my armchair  i d say that the entire banking sector needs to be deleveraged 301 leverage  or whatever it currently is  is too much slowly  over time  to prevent shocks from the deleveraging   deleverage the banks  and it would make it harder for a crisis to become systemic,1
79470,kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying,1
79471,kashkari was part of the paulson team that leveraged the american banking empire into toobigtofail and now that that leverage is proving to be dangerous for the survival of the one per cent kleptocrats he wants to break up the tbtf banks  geithner knew this would manifest when he used tbtf as a stopgap measure to save the synagogue of satan worshiping kleptocracy of fraudsters that run the federal reserve now that same kleptocracy wants to be bailed out once again because geithner s temporary solution has run it s course straight into the gutter where geithner amp  kashkari et al  belong  up yours  america the functional retard,
79473,i grew up in a very small rural town  the high school i attended is part of a huge high school rivalry  one of the biggest in the nation hell its not uncommon for 20000 plus fans to attend the rivalry game  its so big it s held in a college stadium and has more people attend it then the college division 1 team any way i have friends and family members who are convinced the only way to go to college and make something out of yourself is to get there on a football scholarship one of my cousins young kid 16ish has already had a few concussions  his dad just chalks it up to part of the game and thinks parents need to stop being such  pussies  football is for men and if a boy ca nt take it he will never be a man sadly i think a lot of parents feel this way,9
79474,smart move by him  if anything athletes should be focusing back on baseball guaranteed money and long contract,9
79475,and it begins  the exodus away from our national infatuation with football,8
79476,tbi survivor here and former football fanatic even had a denver broncos tat which has since been covered with some other nonsense anyway  brain injuries are obviously bad news as is the nfl s handling of them  i hope this becomes a trend,7
79477,good for him  football does nt have to be a concussion prone sport it started as the american version of rugby  and evolved into the form we see today  and can just as properly evolve into something that is nt effectively a form of human sacrifice  part of how it evolved is the career of pop warner  the coach of the carlisle indian school he kept  how to put it  coaching like a lawyer  and coming up with clever ways to get an edge  that would then eb slapped down with rule changes  surely concussions justify rule changes too,7
79478,i played football for 4 years in highschool started all 4 years i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fu,3
79479,this is really just a click bait story no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers  i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is,5
79480,who would let their son play american football,3

79495,so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10 that does nt make much sense,9
79496,how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killedhow from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human,9
79497,one of these videos was sent to me many years ago  forwarded on a myspace page  yeah  many  years ago   they were trying to  raise awareness  when they sent it to me to help the people get caught  but all they really ended up doing was spreading that ghastly thing to more points of the internet i wo nt describe a single second of it  but suffice it to say that it s horrifying i ve never been able to remove the memory i ve been through a lot in my military career  and yet seeing a 2minute version of one of those videos was easily the most horrible thing i have ever witnessed,9
79498,gt  brent justice  54  was convicted and sentenced monday for cruelty to nonlivestock animals  i guess justice has been served,9

79500,no complaints from me but i ve noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago,9
79501,for once  reading a story of horrifying animal abuse does nt fill me with rage this must be what justice feels like finally  an appropriate sentence so sick of people like these getting slaps on the wrist due to inadequate animal protection laws,9
79502,i read the title then thought  hhmmm what s an animal crush video   who would have thunk it  animal crush videos are videos of animals getting crushed there goes some of the little remaining faith i had in humanit,9

79513,i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective it was the first exposure i d ever had to this subculture  crush fetish   after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals  their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse that s all i have to say about that,1
79515,as someone who just for the first time heard the term animal crush videos  i wash that i had nt something is seriously wrong with you if this is what gets you off,7

79520,i definitely think this guy should be punished and i m glad he was punished  but it blow my mind how a guy like this can get 50 years and a pedophile or rapist can get 1020 or less,5
79521,i do nt understand how the sicko who did the maiming and killing gets 10 years  but the man who filmed it gets 50 that woman should not see light ever again,1

79530,this is a great thing people who are bashing him do not make much sense the monuments in dc are one of the united states  greatest treasures  and likewise they cost a lot to maintain let alone refurbish they are a public venue that is traversed by millions and are awesome to each person that visits  this guy decided to use some of his money to give back and better public places that reside in our nation capital and some see him as an asshole  it is one thing to be bitter about not having that kind of money  it is another thing to get pissed when someone with money gives back,7
79531,its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring,3
79532,good for him i remember the lincoln memorial being one of my more favorite monuments i d like to take my son there some day  so it s nice to see it will be upgraded and fixed up  to all the naysayers and negative commenters  fuck you,5

79537,i think it s great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about what i do nt like is that there should nt even be an issue with funding for our monuments,4
79538,if we re committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i m all for it,1
79539,i wonder how many huge donations like this  maybe smaller  in the hundreds of thousands  have been made for national monuments pretty awesome someone did this wo reading the article  i have to imagine there s a good amount of rigmarole on the donor s end to ensure the donation goes to where the donor actually wanted govt accountability on any level in the us seems kind of weak lately,1
79540,all right  a 15000sqft exhibit room underneathkind of like the one in fallout ,3
79541,can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too,
79542,oh cool thanks  philanthropist guy,3
79543,wow  what an honorable thing to do  while 99  of people in his position would spend the money on useless crap  this guy chooses to spend his money on something so selfless and so much bigger than himself  this guy is a good 1  e,

79548,we are living in a new gilded age,
79549,i certainly appreciate what david has done here but  with all due respect to david  most americans would rather not see financial industry groups  like the carlyle group  suck economic resources out ofaway from most americans instead  we d prefer to pay for these efforts through widespread  robust economic opportunities and the tax contributions they make possible millions of americans and this nation have been greatly diminished as a result of the business activities of groups  like the carlyle group  over several decades  because of grotesque incomewealth inequality  the odds of seeing successful businesspeople like david rubinstein are greatly diminished he only got where he was because of the social ladder that used to exist in this nation,
79550,how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions,
79551,it s gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface themfight to take them down,
79552,those goddamn rich people are at it again  dammit if we could only find a way to tax away their wealth so we could spend it on poorly negotiated deals for mediocre roads and bridges,

79569,good  the prosecution seems to have a solid basis for a case this is one that should definitely go to trial the defense is going to have a tough time with all the press coverage cosby s been getting over these allegations,1

79573,so long commandant lassard  you brought me many laugh,1
79575,if the proposal came from a doctor or scientist  i would be 100  on the side of this bill but it comes from a senator  which makes me want to question it  scientific papers require peer review from the most qualified people to call bullshit on an idea before you can get it published as legitimate i m not saying i m questioning the idea  but i do nt know enough about the process of bills and laws to give it my automatic seal of approval  i think it s a good idea to administer anesthesia to an unborn human that can feel pain whether or not it increases the cost of abortion but the cost is still a talking point all i can do is hope that the people in charge of the decision in the end have the same concerns that i do,8
79576,i mean  we already use anesthesia on fetuses when performing surgery in the womb for exactly this reason  so it s hardly surprising  http  wwwdoctorsonfetalpaincomfetalpaintheevidence5documentatio,7
79577,wether a fetus is under anesthesia is completely dependent on the type of anesthetic being performed any general anesthetic also anesthetizes the fetus while other types like spinal or local do not even then  there is no accurate way to quantify or measure awareness in fetuses  much less adults undergoing anesthesia the body also still responds to pain under anesthesia  as its an autonomic response  so the definition of  feeling pain  is not something that should be measured i feel like awareness  which is impossible to measure in a fetus regardless  is a real idicator of humanity an easy solution would be to simply do all elective abortions under general anesthesia  which may cost more  but is easily doable i have no idea what the preferred method of anesthesia is  if any  for elective abortions  source  i do anesthesia in a catholic hospital,5
79578,i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them,7
79579,they have nt decided at what point of gestation this would happen  gt  montana lawmakers passed a similar law in 2015 requiring fetal anesthesia before surgeries  including abortion  after 20 or more gestational weeks  so  4 months the general consensus for viability outside the womb is around 6 monthsish for some the concept of consciousness coincides with viability outside the womb,6
79580, this is a review on fetal pain   http  jamajamanetworkcomarticleaspx  articleid  201429amp  resultclick  1  from clinical review  although it is 10 years old it says  gt  evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques similarly  limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion,5
79581,is nt this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor s office  would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder,5
79582,ignorant people propose bill based on said ignorance,
79583,i m going to talk about this as delicately as possible i  genuinely  want thoughts and opinions on this subject  i am asking that no one become immediately offended by what i m about to say rather than respond with your opinion telling me why you believe that my view should change i am childfree i do nt want kids  i m 35  so it s pretty much set in stone at this juncture in my life i do nt see myself as a prolife or prochoice supporter and the reason for that is because i kind of agree with both sides on one hand i firmly believe that the destruction of a human being  born or not  is murder it fits the definition  of  murder before you downvote me into oblivion  let me be clear it s not the votes i care about it s that you understand where i m coming from even though i have that belief  i also believe that some people were just not meant to be children but therein lies another debate  why do nt they place it in adoption  because most of the time unwanted children are kept  they re not placed into adoption and when they re kept their chances of being neglected as children  whether it be mentally  emotionally  or physically  rise exponentially i certainly would nt want to have a child and resent it i  do nt  have children because frankly i m mean as a damn snake i do nt see any part of me that could ever have a child and not lose my temper with it and i would nt put a kid through that  because  i  was put through that i would be a horrible parent  anyway  i have a point i swear if you re going to have an abortion  why anesthetize it first  do i believe that it can feel  absolutely  but you re killing it i mean it s not like you re putting it to sleep and saying   here  fight for your life  you re fucking killing it so why have a crisis of conscience about it  again  i m sorry if i offend anyone  that s not my intention i m just a realistic person and it is what it is sugarcoating it does nt change it the bill seems like a waste of time and tax dollars  edit  i do nt understand why this is being downvoted so  please  give me your views instead of leaving me wondering because if there s something i m not understanding it needs to be made clear again this is absolutely not about the votes rather than having a discussion,

79588,the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison,5
79589,are they only being killed for food  that s slaughter  if they are being killed for management purposes  that s called culling,7
79590,it s population control  hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use,6

79640,corruption of public officials in michigan  no way,9
79641,i certainly do nt necessarily agree with public funds being used for a sports stadium  and i definitely do nt agree with nepotism  but i think criticizing mike illitch somehow taking advantage of detroit is a shortsighted mistake had it not been for mr illitch pretty much singlehandily reinvesting in a city everyone wanted to leave behind over the last 20 years  the city would nt even be close to back on a path to relevancy  whether you want to believe it is or not   the other thing to consider is that this new complex not only brings commerce to an area that was a combination of blight and open fields  it also brings quite a few jobs to the city  as well as some stateoftheart buildings that will bring commerce and international travelers to the area for a variety of reasons  conferences  concerts  etc   this all equals more money for the city of detroit  which is why they re willing to make the investment in the first place   and another part of a blightfilled neighborhood updated and usable for the future  this is a sticky situation that reeks of an unfortunate quidproquo  but when it comes to what is good for the city of detroit  it s hard to argue that anyone has anything on the passion and dedication of mike illitch,9
79642,how in the fuck are there no comments about the red wings owner s hair  ,9
79643,everyone talks about the insanity in pro sports these days  yet no one mentions  public or private  universities  which are all nonprofit  spending massive amounts of their cash on stadiums  athletic facilities  etc it s the same thing if the universities are public  and its only marginally different if they re private the reason they have that money in the first place is federallysubsidized student loans,8
79644,lol illitch has done more for the city of detroit than any other person in the last 50 years fuck off,9
79645,so he did a good job for the team and the owner offered him more money for a better job  happens all the time  kids,6
79646,is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit  or ford field  most people would not step foot downtown if it was nt for those two places i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do nt bring forth revitalization like intendedbut the only article i ve read was about stadiums in la and sf,6
79647,before you jump on the  why ca nt detroit use the money for things that actually matter  train   here s   http  wwwcrainsdetroitcomarticle20140921news309219990oncostfinancingofwingsarenahereareanswers  an article outlining the finances of this massive project  edit  s  for those not wanting to click  gt  the initial base price is  450 million problems  changes and added amenities could increase that final cost anything beyond  450 million must be paid by the ilitches  gt  the michigan strategic fund will sell  450 million in two series of bonds they will be divided into  250 million in series a bonds that will be backed by property taxes already captured by the downtown development authority the  200 million in series b bonds will be backed by the  115 million olympia development has agreed to pay the dda for bond retirement  gt  the ilitches  through olympia  will pay  200 million of the bond debt detroit s dda  via its property tax capture ability  will pay back  250 million of the bonds new yorkbased merrill lynch  a division of bank of america  which has pledged to buy all the publicly backed series a bonds in the deal it will then sell the bonds to the public dallasbased comerica bank inc will buy the series b bonds backed by olympia s money the bank  formerly based in detroit  has the naming rights to comerica park  where the ilitchowned detroit tigers play comerica intends to keep the bonds on its books rather then sell them,8
79648, misleading title   https  wwwredditcomrhockeycomments45xs0mdetroit_contractor_who_negotiated_285_million_ind00vnke   it was state money  not detroit s also  ilitch footed most of the bill himself  or through his company   please research  the district  and see their plans for it before passing judgement,9
79649,clickbait no one around here is remotely upset about taxpayer funds going to a new stadium for the most popular team in town we re not really unhappy about the new development for business and residences that is happening and we re not raising any concerns about the effort to revitalize the city  detroit is climbing out of a hole created by the corruption of influential individuals local business and leaders have been more beneficial in this process than any other group and this stadium  and the district surrounding it are seen as victories in this effort,8
79650,ah  a local spin on the old  congressperson becomes lobbyist  setup,5
79651,they are literally building new district for the city not just an arena  a whole new district development is what the city needs and frankly  detroit politics have always been just a  wee  bit corrup,4
79652,but  guys  come on we need our circuses  what would we do with out national sports  concentrate on real issues  lol  that s no fun ,4
79653,at ohio state  the man whole negotiated the deal to sell its parking rights to a private company  campusparc  left to work for them after it was signed,4
79654,you think that s a wig,4
79655,public money should never be allowed to pay for sports teams unless the team has to pay back the city directly  with interest none of this but businesses will benefit  bullsht it s my fucking money you re stealing  i do nt want to  potentially  subsidize businesses downtown,8
79656,if you re a bernie supporter  who thinks a public funded  1 trillion dollar infrastructure package is a good deal because jobs  but is outraged by the state of michigan investing  285 million in the renovationrevitalization of its  largest city  then you might want to reexamine one of those positions,6
79657,for all the people complaining about spending the money on the new stadium and  less mentioned  surrounding developments  all i can say is it will be more than worth it if it fixes up that area governments of all levels have been dumping money into the cass corridor since the early days of johnson s great society programs with any luck this will finally be a solution that stick,7
79658,itt  out of staters have no fucking idea about the current state of economics in detroit and how great this project is going to be for the city  i do nt even know where to begin with this article it s clear the author did nt talk to a single person in the city or state or even try to get a feel for the public opinion on the topic including garbage clickbait phrases like the previous article titled  detroit scam city  how the red wings took hockeytown for all it had  has to be one of the dumbest fucking things i ve ever read  when detroit was at its absolute rock bottom worst  going to joe louis arena was probably the only reason suburban white people would ever go into the city and spend money now mike ilitch wants to build a gigantic urban development project including restaurants  shopping stores    apartment complexes   and oh yeah a brand new stateoftheart arena for one of the most successful hockey teams of all time  they have nt missed the playoffs since before i was born  25 years ago they are a big deal and have been for decades   oh  and it s being built at the exact time there s an influx of young people and new businesses into the the city which will create more upward momentum  yes  the city is helping pay for it the city also got a lot of input on it design  layout  and what additional projects would be built along with the arena this happens in every single city an arenastadium is built i do nt necessarily think that s how it should work but the fact of the matter is that this is how these deals are made and the city absolutely needs projects like this if it wants to continue on its upward trend  also attacks on mike ilitch in this article and this thread are disgusting illitch has been a controversial figure for a long time but his story is like example of the american dream you d see in fiction his parents were poor immigrants  he grew up in detroit joined the marines played minor league baseball for the team he now owns opens up a mom and pop pizza place and creates an empire out of it  gets rich while creating jobs and doing public works projects for the city he grew up in even though it s a complete shit hole mike ilitch has been spending  and yes  making  money in detroit for years mike ilitch was there in the 90 s and early 00 s before there was ever a housing crash in the rest of the country the man is nt a saint but if it were nt for him there would be a lot less charities and projects being invested in now he wants to build a project the city desperately needs with the city s help and input  and he s getting shit on by some dumb ass  journalist  that ca nt get their facts straight  endran,7

79686,most people do nt go to jail for first time dui the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though,5
79687,10 day vehicle impound  that is just a rich vs poor sorter  the poor people cant pay for ten days of impound at  80night right away  so every day they wait to pay its another  80 then they lose their car,6
79688,calls for help  cries for attention  are getting pretty extreme these days  next i m expecting someone to periscope a skydiving jump   i m not going to pull the chute unless i get 100 facebook likes ,3
79689,reddit   there are too many people in prison     person is treated with leniency   reddit   kill her   look  the point of prison is to rehabilitate  keep society safe  or punish maybe this lady was given a hefty amount of probation  something i often ask for because you always have time to throw someone away and put them in prison  but they do nt get that time back  so they ll lose their jobs  houses  children  etc how exactly does society benefit from that   maybe she has a lot of factors that call for mitigation,5
79690,it was nt flordia man it was flordia woman,6
79691,as a 40 year old  are the younger people with smart phones really this fucking stupid  i have a smart phone  and the last freaking thing i do is broadcast every life choice i make what ever happened to  if no one knows  i wo nt get caught  i can remember going to parties in the early 2000 s when digital cameras were getting popular and i would shy away from them while drunk saw lots of compromising photos that did not tell the full story now we are at a point that people are broadcasting this shit live holly hell,3
79692,premeditated drinking and driving is that a thing because she admitted to i,3
79693,very happy she did nt hurt anyone  or herself,1
79694,like it or not  this is pretty standard for 1st time dwi offenses especially since there was nt a wreck or damage to property,1
79695,this is great pr for periscop,1
79696,driving drunk is not easy,1
79697,what is 10 day weekend work release,1
79698,at first i thought this was a reasonable charge  but when i read the article it said that she was actually driving with a flat tire most drunks are smart enough to avoid driving on a flat  this woman is an idiot and deserves a harsh punishment she was intoxicated enough to seriously endanger the lives of others  if an officer had nt pulled her over i m sure she would have caused some serious damage,
79699,that s cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work releas,
79700,well it s not like you can prove that she was actually intoxicated  so the fact that she was nt punished seems appropriate,
79701,and my mom wonders why i m not married,
79705,meanwhile  the cat yawned and continued to wash its face,6
79706,could nt find it in the article  but wonder the breed of the dog not that it matters kudos to dogs ,1
79711,gt   the order is vague and because it imposes disproportionate  intrusive  and punitive measures against households and businesses with   no due process     did nt see that one coming,9
79712,isps do nt actually want to spy on their customers like that it costs more money to put systems in place to do so and to maintain and operate those systems on top of that  it will only bring them bad press that could piss off customers  cox is basically saying  fuck you i m not taking a significant financial hit to spy on our customers so you can sue them and make money for yourself  they are doing the right thing  and the right thing also happens to be in their best business interest,9
79713,good guy cox  not selling out their customers  they actually have super reliable internet no outages in any of my apartments so far,9
79714,so to sum that up we do nt have to worry about any cox blocking,9
79715,that s nice  but i m still going to run a vpn,8
79716,all in all i ve been pretty happy with cox as an isp i ve used them in two different cities and it s always been reliable and fast i pay for 300mbps service and always get those speeds  usually higher almost no outages they re putting in 1gbs service in many of their cities right now  including mine  my biggest gripe with them is they have a soft data cap of 2 tb for my tier they do not enforce the caps at all but the fact that they exist means they are probably toying with the idea and there would be nothing to stop them from going evil since they are a monopoly like every other major isp it s like a benevolent dictatorship  http  wwwspeedtestnetmyresult5089441276 that s with a netflix stream going on in another room right now,9
79717,this must be a new thing many a year s ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did nt even know what that was  none of us knew what that even was and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi,7
79718,i ve been really happy with cox for an isp both personally and professionally here in okc personally  out of nowhere they bumped my at home connection from 15mbit to 100mbit and my bill  went down  30  all out of nowhere  without me saying a word internet is always up  not throttled  and they have decent support if it s needed  professionally at my job i ran in ip phone deployment with them for our main office  3 satellite offices they were there 100  of the way i have personal names and numbers to call in the event of issues outside of the scope of my support as the companies it admin  and when we ve needed someone on site to climb a pole for instance their longest response time was 45 minutes  i know this sounds like rhailcorporate but the fact is out of all the isps i ve had  comcast  qwest  charter  etc  they ve been the best that s not saying they should nt and could nt be better  but they re angels next to the others  in fact they proactively contact me at work every once and awhile to check on things which i greatly appreciate and they bring us cookies every month yes  our isp brings yes cookies no  we re not a big company 9 employees they re just nice,8
79719,basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum,8
79720,i used to work for cox in the field and inside cox did have a department that would monitor massive down loading and uploading but they did away with it shortly after i got there  within a year cox ca nt afford to lose customers right now so it s no surprise they are nt allowing this if they did then they would go out of business from customer loss i survived their huge layoff and realignment,5
79721,this is nothing new from cox i have had cox internet for over 10 years and worked for them a few years ago they have always had this attitude toward it s customers the customer pays for internet access  cox provides internet access they do nt even enforce data caps  at least in oklahoma   i have received a few emails due to using so much data suggesting that i switch to a business plan to maximize my speed  but have never been charged extra or cut off due to exceeding a data cap,7
79722,gt  last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers  what the actual fucking fuck,6
79723,as a customer this is the first good thing i ve ever heard from cox,4
79724,not true from my experience,3
79725,i ve had them as an isp for several years and they re excellent i did have one month where i went over my allowed bandwidth limit  300 gb on a 50 mbps down plan   and all i got was an email saying  do nt do that again   no throttling or charges or anything on 100 mbps down plan right now and i usually get 110 at least they re great  come out to me if i m having internet trouble that s not solved by online support  etc pretty good basically  i love cox and i m very satisfied with how much i get,3
79726,unrelated but i could nt stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox,3
79727,i am a proud supporter of cox,3
79728,where are all the penis jokes,3
79729,not as nice as it sounds if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do nt catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status  eg that they do nt have any liabilityresponsibility for what people use their pipe for   most carriers are  very  vested in not being the internet police,3
79730,i m guessing that if they had a way to monetize it and add to the bottom line  they d be very supportive,3
79731,when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battl,5
79732,cox is actually a familyowned business one of the major interest holders is a 96 year old woman who inherited from her father  she had been running it with her sister until her death in 2007   i happen to think they re one of the leastshady isp and cable providers out there  they also own the travel channel  which is a pretty great channel,5
79733,i thought this was talking about jesse cox,4
79734,i work for cox corporate in a startup tech company  and this makes me so happy  btw  they re just as decent an employer as they are an isp compan,3
79735,cox is spying like a champ  rest assured you have to be quite innocent or high on meth to think they have nt supplied info to big brother and his little brothers  and will not in the future,3
79736,yells loudly  i will not    whispers  if you need me too,1
79737,on that headline alone  i thought jessie cox was asked to spy on his youtube subs  was very confused for a little bit,1
79738,i knew he was my favorite eagl,1
79739,well that s one bit of good news from cox now if they d stop raising my rates every few months,1
79740,damn  i wish i had cox i have time warner and i m on my 3rd notice to stop torrenting i do nt know if they ll actually pull the plug  they re charging me out the ass already since they re the only provider in my area,1
79741,fuck yea cox   comcast   1  co,1
79742,cox  and to some extent time warner  are cable companies all cable companies fuck you in the ass  these two have the decency to spit on it first i at the very least get what i pay for with both of them,1
79743,they sent me a few emails in the past  so i got a vpn i will still use it  but good on cox for not being dickbags,1
79744,they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jone,1
79745,i had cox for 3 years service was good  and over that 3 years  doubled my download speeds twice no extra cost upload was still garbage  but hey 10015 internet for  65 a month was still pretty killer i have 7575 fios now,1
79746,almost every single person in my area that has gone to atamp  t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable  they have some shit with them but it s far less shit than others,1
79747,they re my isp and even though they re the only isp in my city besides att and verizon  they ve been awesome,1
79748,the shifting of blame to continue  going after johns and endusers has never worked,1
79749,ho yeah  today is a good day to have cox  teehee,1
79750,horseshit they cut off our internet because someone was downloading something like a year ago they re the best isp i ve ever used  but they absolutely do exactly what the mpaa et al want,1
79751,between cox and cable one in both places i live  i actually like our midwest internet providers i feel bad for people getting rammed by twc and comcast we ve paid  45 for 100mbps for several years  which sounds way better than the horror stories i hear from you guys,1
79752,cause they love internet freedom  or because it costs an extra 30 cents to have an extra indian screen data at the call center for 70 an hour,1

79771,gt  gt  johnson says the man s family will be shown body camera footage of the incident before it s released publicly  well  that s an improvement,6
79772,personally working as security guard in a hospital  and having to deal with people who have mental health issues its not fun  or safe and generally the actual hospital staff is nt very helpful i ve been kicked in the head  punched in the face  and many other things happen sometimes these people can not be handled and tazeing could deescalate the situation,4
79773,from what i ve read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops it looks like the taser use was justified sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca nt be deescalated otherwise  has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died,6
79774,this is unacceptable tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are nt,7
79775,he died 5 days later at a different hospital  clickbait headline i m sure we ll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death,6
79776,well at least the officers saved the victim from harming  himself ,1
79777,he died a week later he was also resisting arrest,3
79778,officers ca nt subdue people without shocking them to deathstun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only not some wack trying to get mental help,
79779,oh this is lame  his identity has not been released  nor the race of the officers   wtf does that have to do with anything  oh that s right more race bating by the media,1
79780,police are to trigger happy they could easily have uses theiroh,1
79781,the article states he was attacking staff and police using glass vials the police were not obliged to wrestle this violent person and risk getting stabbed by broken glass it s pretty simple  do nt violently attack innocent people and you wo nt be tased,

79794,from  government  s memorandum in support of its motion for pretrial detention   http  wwwscribdcomdoc29947153421616doc4usavclivenbundyusadetentionmemorandumforclivenbundy  gt  bundy is lawless and violent he does not recognize federal courts  claiming they are illegitimate  does not recognize federal law  refuses to obey federal court orders  has already used force and violence against federal law enforcement officers while they were enforcing federal court orders  nearly causing catastrophic loss of life or injury to others he has pledged to do so again in the future to keep federal law enforcement officers from enforcing the law against him as of the date of this hearing  he continues to violate federal court orders and continues to possess the proceeds of his illegal activities  gt  gt  bundy is currently charged with crimes of violence including using and brandishing firearms in connection with crimes of violence under title 18  united states code  section 924  c   as such  the bail reform act presumes that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that will ensure the safety of the community 18 usc  3142  e   3   b   here  no evidence has been adduced during the investigation of the instant charges that even remotely hints at a rebuttal to that presumption in fact  all the evidence suggests that bundy will continue to act lawlessly  will not abide by court orders  and will use violence to ensure that federal laws are not enforced as to him,8
79795, bundy asked for a courtappointed attorney at his first hearing last week  still living off govt handouts i see,8
79796,gt  bundy   his  attorney said  would go to court in nevada if ordered to do so   right  sure i mean  it s not like he s ever defied the government before  and he  totally  recognises it s legitimacy  gt  but judge stewart said if bundy was released   i  m guessing that  s the last we  ll ever see of mr bundy  a wise and perspicacious judge,9
79797, daughterinlaw briana bundy said tuesday that a federal judge in oregon should let the 69yearold live at home while he awaits trial  sure that s an excellent suggestion i would further suggest that the judge prepare a lunch of peanut butter sandwiches with home made raspberry jam and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies for mr bundy each day,8
79798,gt  the judge said bundy  69  is a flight risk and a danger to the community in the bail hearing tuesday afternoon in downtown portland i mean i ca nt really find a reason not to agree with that a 69 year old who does nt believe he s beholden to the law is as dangerous as a 29 year old who does nt believe he s beholden to the law,8

79802,the man is a wellmeaning but ideologically obsessed idiot the government has handled this clusterfuck extremely well  and i am not one to say that lightly,6
79803,it s important for the government to provide a consistent and cohesive narrative if they are to help squash future acts of rebellion cliven bundy and his ilk are lawless  violent  redneck anarchists and none of the things they protested had any validity whatsoever,5
79804,good  this arrest and trial has been delayed for too long,7
79805,given his history  bundy is as dangerous as a monkey with a straightrazor,4

79823,two poems  wow  those should be good for  what  six to eight movies,1
79825,if the proposal came from a doctor or scientist  i would be 100  on the side of this bill but it comes from a senator  which makes me want to question it  scientific papers require peer review from the most qualified people to call bullshit on an idea before you can get it published as legitimate i m not saying i m questioning the idea  but i do nt know enough about the process of bills and laws to give it my automatic seal of approval  i think it s a good idea to administer anesthesia to an unborn human that can feel pain whether or not it increases the cost of abortion but the cost is still a talking point all i can do is hope that the people in charge of the decision in the end have the same concerns that i do,8
79826,i mean  we already use anesthesia on fetuses when performing surgery in the womb for exactly this reason  so it s hardly surprising  http  wwwdoctorsonfetalpaincomfetalpaintheevidence5documentatio,7
79827,wether a fetus is under anesthesia is completely dependent on the type of anesthetic being performed any general anesthetic also anesthetizes the fetus while other types like spinal or local do not even then  there is no accurate way to quantify or measure awareness in fetuses  much less adults undergoing anesthesia the body also still responds to pain under anesthesia  as its an autonomic response  so the definition of  feeling pain  is not something that should be measured i feel like awareness  which is impossible to measure in a fetus regardless  is a real idicator of humanity an easy solution would be to simply do all elective abortions under general anesthesia  which may cost more  but is easily doable i have no idea what the preferred method of anesthesia is  if any  for elective abortions  source  i do anesthesia in a catholic hospital,5
79828,i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them,7
79829,they have nt decided at what point of gestation this would happen  gt  montana lawmakers passed a similar law in 2015 requiring fetal anesthesia before surgeries  including abortion  after 20 or more gestational weeks  so  4 months the general consensus for viability outside the womb is around 6 monthsish for some the concept of consciousness coincides with viability outside the womb,6
79830, this is a review on fetal pain   http  jamajamanetworkcomarticleaspx  articleid  201429amp  resultclick  1  from clinical review  although it is 10 years old it says  gt  evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques similarly  limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion,5
79831,is nt this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor s office  would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder,5
79832,ignorant people propose bill based on said ignorance,
79833,i m going to talk about this as delicately as possible i  genuinely  want thoughts and opinions on this subject  i am asking that no one become immediately offended by what i m about to say rather than respond with your opinion telling me why you believe that my view should change i am childfree i do nt want kids  i m 35  so it s pretty much set in stone at this juncture in my life i do nt see myself as a prolife or prochoice supporter and the reason for that is because i kind of agree with both sides on one hand i firmly believe that the destruction of a human being  born or not  is murder it fits the definition  of  murder before you downvote me into oblivion  let me be clear it s not the votes i care about it s that you understand where i m coming from even though i have that belief  i also believe that some people were just not meant to be children but therein lies another debate  why do nt they place it in adoption  because most of the time unwanted children are kept  they re not placed into adoption and when they re kept their chances of being neglected as children  whether it be mentally  emotionally  or physically  rise exponentially i certainly would nt want to have a child and resent it i  do nt  have children because frankly i m mean as a damn snake i do nt see any part of me that could ever have a child and not lose my temper with it and i would nt put a kid through that  because  i  was put through that i would be a horrible parent  anyway  i have a point i swear if you re going to have an abortion  why anesthetize it first  do i believe that it can feel  absolutely  but you re killing it i mean it s not like you re putting it to sleep and saying   here  fight for your life  you re fucking killing it so why have a crisis of conscience about it  again  i m sorry if i offend anyone  that s not my intention i m just a realistic person and it is what it is sugarcoating it does nt change it the bill seems like a waste of time and tax dollars  edit  i do nt understand why this is being downvoted so  please  give me your views instead of leaving me wondering because if there s something i m not understanding it needs to be made clear again this is absolutely not about the votes rather than having a discussion,

79852,not really too much context given here  so it s hard to guess at the actual situation  but federal student loans  at least direct loans and the majority of those older loans passed back to fsa as they phased out the guarantee programs  do nt get sold to private collection agencies at this time maybe that part happened a while back  before current policies went into place and the collectors are taking advantage of the protections that federallyoriginated loans have  anyway  for people who are interested in learning more about how defaulted federal student loans are being collected today   check this out   https  wwwfbogovindex  s  opportunityamp  mode  formamp  id  216a8418f8e71f0c9c3475946ab100f8amp  tab  coreamp  _cview  1  they re currently in the middle of contracting new private collection agencies to service defaulted loans and you can see in the rfp documents how agencies are being scored and how that ties into account assignments  basically  for those who do nt feel like running through all of it  the big emphasis for student loan collections now is getting people through affordable rehabilitation options and into incomedriven repayment plans placements look like they re going to be based about 50  on careful regulatory compliance and borrower satisfaction surveys  which would make it extremely difficult for high pressure collections tactics to work out in the long run  none of that changes this story  just thought it was interesting in light of some of the comments i ve read that indicate people believe strongarm collection tactics for student loans will always be the norm  tldr  they re at least trying to throw a friendly paint job over the horribly broken federal student loan system these days,9
79853,if you dont show up to court after you have been served this is what happens he has been ignoring collection attempts  he got served and ignored that too im not in favor of this man being arrested but you cant ignore court summons if you get served you have to go,9
79854,upconwell said it best  gt  you are reading way to much into the article no one said they were violent no one said they had their guns drawn they are us marshals  they carry guns  every god damn day   gt  they probably went to his door  knocked he answered and they said  hey  we have a warrant for you for failing to appear in a federal court   he probably said  oh shit let me get some pants  gt  no violence  no guns drawn  everything was pretty standard and nonviolent  gt  plus  it should be noted that he was not arrested for failing to pay student loans  he was arrested for violating a court order,9
79855,how do you not pay a  1500 loan after 30 friggin years,9
79856,gt  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  this almost reads like satire,9
79857,i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors,9
79858,where in this article did it say  guns drawn  as most people are stating here  it says  with guns   every on duty us marshal goes through their day  with guns   someone signed a contract for a loan  and then spends almost three decades not paying it i agree that a police force should nt have been used there are financial measures that can be taken upon default of a loan rather than criminal  but i m really surprised by the circle jerk that s happening over a fox news article,9
79859,can i get a misleading title please,8
79860,you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day,6
79861,lol  you guys are so gullible the guy dodged this debt and refused to engage the proper authorities for 25 years this is nt a new college graduate that missed one payment then you have the cascade of predictable posts stating  boot lickers    debtors prison  and how in 30 years this will be the watershed moment we all look back to as we are enslaved by the government this is a statement case the feds took an extreme example and made an extreme example of this putz the goal of this action is compliance and to get folks to not ignore their obligations the money spent on this will scare the other million folks that are past due to actually pick up the phone and engage them to resolve the debt no one held a gun to this guy s head to sign up for the student loans and no one was stopping him for 25 years from making a payment plan for the remaining  1500 this guy deserved it and as a tax payer this is ok by me,9
79862,real story here dude was sued by the united state of america  he refused to appear  a default judgment was issued against him  he refused to appear for postjudgment depositions  judge issued an order directing him to appear in court  he ignored it and then the judge issued an arrest warrantincareration order and federal judges use us marshalls to enforce their orders  so he was nt arrested for having old student loans he was arrested for refusing to comply with a direct order from the judge  http  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386htm,8
79863,that dude could not come up with  1500 in 29 years,8
79864, a few years ago congress allowed the private sector to contract for student loan collections and so you have these private companies who are doing this  i find this scary  even though i have no student loans to pay off they dragged this dude to court and made him sign an agreement in front of their private attorney he had no attorney present  and was nt read any rights  edit  quote is from the video,9
79865,forever grateful i graduated with minimal student loans ca nt ignore bills for 25 years though  regardless of what those payments stem from from reading through the comments here  it seems like incomebased payment option is the smartest option,6
79866,i wish my student loan balance was  1500,6
79867,i knew this story was light on facts turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies  source   yahoo finance   https  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386html,6
79868,gt  our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is nt the first and wo nt be the last  this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least,8
79869,he was nt arrested for not paying his loan  he was arrested for not showing up in court  and the marshals did nt storm his house guns blazing they had guns  with them   like every other cop in the entire country,7
79870,if you take money and have no plans on paying it back  it s called stealing,9
79871,right the debt collectors just bought the debt  payed the filing fees to bring the case to court  threatened the man with their now official   pay us or else  and when he did not they used their settlement to have him arrested by the marshals nope  no government officers for hire here  just good old debt collection paid and serviced through the courts,5
79872,til that most people have no understanding how the court system works  yes  civil attorneys can issue subpoenas  yes  a court can hold you in contempt if you fail to appear yes  a potential punishment for contempt is a bench warrant for your arrest  tl  dr  you can not simply ignore subpoenas you may go to jail,5
79873,writing and publishing articles like this is dangerous the author offered a sensationalist angle on the  story  while leaving out key elements of why they were there in the first place ie missing court summons this is highly unethical and paints the federal government into a larger narrative that fox has been going for basically  rallying people by emotion not logic,5
79874,this just in  there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government film at 1,5
79875,student loans were made with certain assumptions about the future of the economy  both on the part of the schools  the tuition they charge   the lenders  and the student people should be required to pay their student loans but they should be adjusted downward  edit  this guy had a loan for  1500 measly bucks and did nt make any payments in 30 years  i would like to know if he was destitute  or just decided  fuck you everyone  i want to keep my money ,8
79876,misleading title the marshals service will  arrest  you if you fail to show up for a court appearance you are not being tossed in jail  you are being hauled into court when you refused to answer a summons  from the article   paul aker says he was arrested at his home last week for a  1500 federal student loan he received in 1987  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  does anyone feel sorry for this man   1500  be serious,7
79877,if i did nt pay back a federal loan for 29 years  i d kind of expect for there to be negative effects this dude did nt pay his loan  including when he was taken to court over it and received a judgment from the court specifically telling him to pay it if you ignore a court order  you re gon na have a bad time  i mean yes  the financial aid system needs to be fixed  but they re going after people who purposely are nt paying their loans which is a surprising amount of people  given how many refund chasers there are in the world for anyone else  there are programs like deferment options  sliding payscales  and whatever else along with loan forgiveness after 20 years  it s a shitty system  but this guy s case is not going to be the one to change it because he does nt deserve to have people dying on his hill for his particular cause,7
79878,i m socialist and firmly believe that education and medical care should be paid for by federal government out of contributions that we make  however with that said  if you are contributing member of society you have to be a special kind of asshole not to repay  1500 loan over the period of 29 years no matter what was that loan used for,8
79879,why is this news,3
79880,dude got letters in his mail for months to pay and appear in court  this doesnt just come out of the blue he refused to show up to court multiple times thats a criminal offense,5
79881,the revolution will not be subsidize,5
79882,the whole student loan thing is a complete disaste,6
79883,talk is cheap  between the intelligence agencies  an the lack of marijuana decriminalizatoinlegalizatoin  obama is nt that idfferent from previous administration,5
79884,just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to the paper really is nt worth it otherwise college is becoming a joke anyways,5
79885,every interaction i have ever had with navient  they have done everything they can to work with me  is your payment affordable  would you like a deferment  etc  i have had to take them up on that because of divorce not saying that is everyone s experience but they have nt been the loan sharks everyone else seems to act like they are just one man s experience though,5
79892,sounds a lot like hitech money laundering to m,1
79894,at least the guy was honest,4
79895,i would nt be mad if it was my wallet,1
79896,how do they know the guy was homeless,1
79898,i hope they get it right and protest the us department of education if student loans are your issue  go straight to the source of your ills ironically enough  the only way to end student debt is to scale down and eventually eliminate the student loan program,7
79899, protesters lose jobs for not showing up to work  arrested for nonpayment,7
79900,i see payday loans taking this route soon,5
79901,did nt we get rid of debtor s prisons  i m confuse,4
79902,i believe this happened as i heard this story from other news sources  but some info had to be left out or missing in the us if you owe money on a debt the personcompany has seven years to collect if they do nt the debt disappears if they take you to court and get a judgement they have ten years to collect and it can be renewed for ten more years the only way he could be arrested is if the loan company took him to court  won a judgement and then took further action to force the debtor to court this would not be something to come out of the blue,3
79903,more from the professional  victim class  i guess you need something to do in between police shootings and sanders rallies,4
79905,gt  barbins has been charged with  displaying obscene matter to a minor  and child pornography  police say  sounds like a molestation charge is soon to follo,3
79906,when asked why he did it mr barbins replied   i thought it was ok  this is a catholic school  fwiw i do nt know if the school is affiliated with the holy c or the founders simply had a hardon for mother mary,1
79907,i wonder how reddit is going to try to defend  this  pedophile,
79909,the government issued 15 billion euros of sixyear notes to yield 198 percent  gt  and 1 billion euros of 15year bonds with a 342 percent yield  the finance ministry said in an emailed statement,3
79910,anyone else surprised at the extremely low interest rates for mexican bonds  i would of thought that their borrowing costs was more in line with other developing countries,1
79912,can you tell florida house that please ,1
79914,has nt he already had  like  two years to prevent this in the first place,7
79915,lansing has actually dealt with this problem and their civil engineers have a solution which is both fast and more costeffective than traditional measures they connect the end of the new pipe to the old pipes so when they pull out the old pipe they simultaneously thread the new pipes into the existing space this speeds up the process and the people in lansing estimate with adequate training  involving them with the process in flint  and hiring enough crews it can be completed for flint in one year,7
79916,this whole situation is a national embarrassment  and it makes my blood boil  but what does naacp have to do with city water  is it a race issue as well  i ve never seen the demographics on flint  come to think of it  maybe aspca should get involved  too i bet people are still feeding their pets city water no matter what  edit  i just think it should be about officials   doing their fucking jobs    framing it as a race issue might just come back to bite us  who knows how many towns are discreetly checking for  and finding  elevated lead  should it matter how many african americans live there  if so  how should officials proceed differently  will it result in a process of public relations triage  that prioritizes black communities  public officials just need to do their fucking jobs for the public they serve there s no need to complicate this with race,5
79917,that s like threatening to get one of those online white house petitions going it does nt matter,1
79918,fix flint s water pipes or they ll burn flint to the ground,3
79919,i m all for getting this fixed as quickly as possible but i also do nt want something rushed either figure it out figure it out right,1
79920,okayand then what  all of the protesting has nt done jack so far what s one more protest going to do  it s not going to make the state government move any faster  it s very clear that the government  at every level  is more concerned about covering itself a protest is nt going to change that,
79921,sooooo glad i do nt live in flint  that place sounds like a complete disaster,
79922,who the fuck are they to demand this  are whiteasianlatino people not allowed to be affected by this,
79924,hibner is especially surprised it happened in the gym  where the floor is just 15 years old  he said gt   i just think sometimes strange things happen and there s no explanation for the phenomena  even though it was a scary situation for players and parents  he said the girl who was injured is expected to be ready to play in the near future,7
79925, impaled  sounds about as much of an overstatement as  got a splinter  would be an understatement in this case,7
79926,gt   i  ve got a tournament here in two weeks  and i have every belief that we  ll be playing on this court that as well   hibner said  or you could put your petty shit on the backburner and ensure the safety of kids by paying for a structural analysis,4
79927,scott walker will fix it if there s any money in it for him or his buddies  right  wisconsin  aka the louisiana of the north,3
79928,they need to have an official inspection of the floor  not just parent volunteers,1
79929,she should sue the schoo,
79931,dude that deserve to be hung in the public square by their genitalia and beaten like a pinyata by roidedup baseball player,
79933,free expression runs counter to the new religion of progressivism the two simply are not compatible,5
79934,before you all get too deep in to your selfrighteous conservative circlejerk  you guys are aware that this commissioner was a former verizon executive who spoke out avidly against net neutrality  right  dont you think it s a bit rich to believe that he gives any fucks about free expression,1
79935,from the regressive left s perspective  by censoring and silencing opposing opinions  especially those from sources merely  perceived  as not being   progressive   regressive enough  they are allowing for  traditionally oppressed groups  to   be used as a mouthpiece that ca nt be challenged because of cries of racism   speak  just as long as they say the correct    progressive   regressive things ,
79937,interesting though   since 2005  texas has prosecuted 38 juveniles for intoxication manslaughter or intoxication assault only three were sent to the adult system  and half of all cases resulted in probation of some kind  i think this is more telling of the justice system  and accessibility to competent  quality counsel it s clear money buys better legal counsel  but if the government subsidized public defense more heavily  the outcomes would clearly be different,9
79938,cash is king in the world of corruption,9
79939,i said this somwhere else  but it s also pertinent here  everyone is equal under the law and money is how we measure that equality,9
79940,the difference  money,9
79941,it s almost like the rich live under different rules,8
79942,this is standard practice in the us judicial system outcomes will vary from case to case depending on financial status there s actually a legal term for it  it s called   cream ,9
79943,my mom has always said guilty until proven rich,8
79944,i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law this is the american dream,8
79945,and liberty and justice for all  who can afford it ,5
79946,i love how this article just glosses over the fact that arellano had previous dui convictions which is why he did nt receive the same sentence  this was couch s first dui case which is why he got probation  as texas takes the rehab route  but whatever lets rage and ignore the fact,8
79947,is everyone here honestly  seriously shocked that money gets you out of trouble  am i taking crazy pills,5
79948,going beyond the dae legal system is corrupt  circlejerk in this thread  there are certainly some differences in these cases firstly  the arellano case  the other one in the article  happened in 2007  six years before couch s trial likewise  the article says that arellano had driven while intoxicated and drank underage before  which means that he would ve had a greater chance of being moved to an adult trial meanwhile  couch had no prior violations of the law  meaning that he could nt be moved to an adult court,6
79949,i understand what you are trying to do with your anecdotal case comparisons however  they are nt comparable cases when you consider all the factors  including criminal history  but  even if you ignore all the other factors  i know of a white 20 yo male from a fairly wealthy family in my area who was sent to prison for a year based on a drunk driving accident so my anecdotal evidence shows similar punishment to your anecdotal case thereby anecdotally refuting your point,8
79950,the real crime here those eyebrow,6
79951,gee  it s almost like different judges and prosecutors in different areas with separate cases can lead to different verdicts or something,6
79952,that s why the case became famous because he got away while guilty that was autocorrect capitalization,4
79953,affluenza is just a fake term that means the following  if you are rich  you do nt go to jail if you are not  you will spend 10 years like 95  of americans,4
79954,let s be clear what happened to the poor kid was what s supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone you fucking go to prison couch was the exception,7
79955,he did nt go free he was on probation and then he violated that  so he s going to jail,8
79956,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,3
79957,if someone is brought up too rich to not know the difference between right and wrong  why can the same argument not be used for poor people who commit crimes  people who are brought up in poverty do nt really know right from wrong just as much as a kid who has rich parents,3
79958,that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time,3
79959,  sees title   probably not a rich white kid   clicks article   and yuuuuuuuuuup sm,3
79960,prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win,3
79961,obviously as white god intended,4
79962,i fucking hate ethan couch  i mean look at that look on his face disgusting i mean even his name is stupid,5
79963,horrible headline  38 cases of dui manslaughter in texas since 2005 and only 3 of them went to adult court  that tells you the vast majority of these cases are handled with kid glovesso picking out one of 3 that went the other route and comparing it to the affluenza case is disingenuous  but fuck it  that is what the media does today god forbid they instead do an article focusing on how in texas if you are a drunk driving kid that kills people you will get away with it 35 out of 38 time,4
79964,it did nt seem to mention how they had the same judge  we ve already established this same judge would have been open to giving a similar sentence to a poor minority because she tried to do just that keep making this a race issue  though lord knows the media loves to stir up ignorant poor folks  also  anyone who comes to the us illegally and kills is citizens deserves little sympathy he was a juvenile  so it would be appropriate to release him and deport him  i do nt understand the need to distort issues to make tbem about race we already have enough problems it s already an established fact that those with the means to afford a lawyer fair better than those who do nt,3
79965,the difference  money,1
79966,did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window,1
79967,by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time,1
79968,excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did,1
79969,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,1
79970,lemmeguess ethnic  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they re ethnic,1
79971,cash rules everything around me they have  and very good lawyers,1
79972,well  on one hand you have a kid that killed 3 adults and a child in a crash  and on the other a kid who killed a mother and her  unborn child  in a crash in a conservative state so he could have mowed down 10 born people and probably got less than what he gets for  accidentally  killing 1 unborn baby,1
79973,free public defender vs 2000  an hour lawyer,1
79974,this affluenza thing still baffles me  doing bad things because money  with that sort of logic hobos must be saints and not the crack heads living under bridges,1
79975,no shit  i mean was nt the entire outrage that similar cases normally lead to prison in the first place,1
79976,seriously  the rich kid,1
79977,that s what  affluenza  means literally the entire point of this case and why it s been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich,1
79978,i say it like my grandma used to  money talks  bullshit walks,1
79979,he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows wtf,1
79980,there s actually a legal question that you asked,1
79981,you do nt automatically get a dui in fact,1
79982,biggest problem in the universe  vote it up  http  thebiggestproblemintheuniversecomepisode8,1
79985,well  that ought to take care of the problem,1
79986,i like that guy after all  i would only do it for the money with minimal violence  and would never want to kill people so  if i ever decide to go and work for a cartel  i m  definitely  working for el jesus,1
79987,is he hiring mercenaries  or he has enough already  it s also not a problem to join any military  as they re all doing god s work,1
79988,well  if their since could nt be instantly forgiven  that might have had weight,1
79989,clearly  jesus would prefer that you support the child rape industrial complex because that s how he rolls,1
79990,jesus the auto repairman,1
79992,no need to make em human shaped  i want a hoo,1
79994,in this case  i hope what happens in vegas stays in vegas,7
79995,man  if this was the best the americans could offer for rebellion  we might as well embrace fascism the government is far smarter than these guys  guy loses both his kids  and freaks out  leaves  petoria   http  familyguywikiacomwikipetoria   and gets popped is nt there a tvtropes page about this,1
79996,all the air out of the takeover lol,4
79997,lock him in prison for a long time,1
79998,yes  let him wait for trial on his ranch that will definitely work out well,
80000,this is why a lot of former cops are setting up companies where they transport the cash for it it s also a huge motivation for the stores to keep 2 separate sets of books  a real one and one the irs gets to see,9
80001,this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day,9
80002,gt  one of the three men who escaped from a california jail last month had been charged with kidnapping a marijuana dispensary owner that they suspected had hidden large amounts of cash in the desert the man and his accomplices are accused of driving the dispensary owner out to the desert  torturing him and cutting off his penis  sheesh i m not carrying more than  10 in my wallet from now on  and that has nothing to do with the fact that i m broke,9
80003,this is why they get robbed all the time out here no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys,7
80004,ca nt these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us,8
80005,there s a great documentary on netflix called  high profits  about a business in breckenridge  co right before full legalization took effect  one of the big issues was exactly this only being able to do business in cash from payroll to paying city taxes they had  120k in cash they had to just walk into the front of the city building with and that was just the first month alone  some of the people that make the drops to the shops are walking out with  10k in their pockets and no security at all it s terrifying,8
80006,civil forfeiture time,6
80007,ironically  it s also just flat out illegal to own large sums of money anything over a few hundred bucks  and the government can sieze that money  because the money committed the crime of intent to purchase narcotics,9
80008,time to start using gold,6
80009,so the tax man will gladly take cannadollars  but the banks will not this is ridiculously stupid,6
80010,same deal in washington still have to buy my shit with cash oh but i can buy cigs and alcohol with a card no problem  if you want to pick up a gram here or there it s no problem  but i buy in bulk  since it s cheaper that means i need to stop by the bank to get  140 that s the only time i carry that much money on me  it s like requiring a personal check to get a passport no cashier s check  no card wtf it s 2016,8
80011,are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money,4
80012,this war on cash is such bullshit  people carried cash until 12 years ago and it was perfectly fine  now they are trying to restrict flying with cash  purchasing with cash  seizing cash   the only problem is that the money is due on one day  they need to have the tax office take payment on any day of the week  so it s stacked,6
80013,i wonder how negative interest rates  if implemented  would effect the marijuana business these value of the business would probably increase as they had large sums of cash on hand their credit worthiness would increase because they had something of value  cash  but they would be penalized for depositing that cash according to the recent imf working paper i wonder if they would become attractive targets for some banks to help capitalize their weak balance sheets,3
80014,oh well let you do business  but you just wo nt be able to use any banks what a backwards ass countr,3
80015,this is a perfect storm for evil doers who seize this unfortunate opportunity all they would have to to do is steak out a caregiver facility i would hope something changes soon this is absurd and the last word of that article  like my post  is penis,3
80016,they should accept bitcoin problem solved,3
80017,and you just made it worse by telling people thi,6
80018,meanwhile   larry summers  it s time to kill the  100 bill   http  wwwbusinessinsidercomsummerstimetokillthe100bill20162  the banking system is corrupt anyhow its time to flush this turd system for something better,5
80019,sell gift cards  buy them with debitcredit then use the gift card,5
80020,so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash,3
80021,bitcoin is the answe,4
80022,time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins,4
80023,that  s because it  s cash day at the collection center  when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill  and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot,4
80024,pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california,1
80025,its a shame they cant count on the highwayrobber police to guard the money,1
80026,it looks like they re tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books,1
80027,this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is,1
80028,someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy,1
80029,what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit  checks for those transactions  then just but the trees with the gift certificate,1
80030,as if the banks do nt take drug money as we speak it is also not like the fbi do nt have cases on going against those banks i really do nt see why there is a problem,1
80031,can they not employ armored trucks,1
80032,it s the same way in washington and colorado it s still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed,1
80033,since the money cant be deposited into a bank would a good option to take be converting it into precious metals such as gold  you would still need to store the gold but that could be easily done in a safety deposit however unless you know where to go  getting that much gold could raise the attention of people you dont want raised to begin with it s not like in china or india  if you show up with a briefcase of cash and walk out with a smaller case of gold  no one really cares,1
80034,can they print their tax forms using hemp paper  and then turn them into the irs,1
80035,watch out for that   cop robbery   civil asset forfeiture,1
80036,so  did anyone else read that article right to the end  the last sentence oof,1
80037,it would be interesting for all of the companies to announce they were bringing their taxes to the tax office on a particular day let it be known to all criminals in the state i wonder if the state might decide to put some security on the place  then,1
80038,build your own secure fort no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building,1
80041,just in time for the marijuana legalization bill this november,7
80042,arizona   republican   legislators want to subvert the will of the people ftf,7
80043,sounds reasonable to me  more easily  is such a loaded headline current law states ballot measures need 34th of both chambers of legislature to overturn ballot measures no matter how narrowly they pass mesnard wants to amend the law so that the amount needed to overturn is proportional to the margin the measure passed  people want to sit here and think this is some republican ploy on the grounds of marijuana measures  but what happens if some sleazy right wing john kavanagh inspired measure gets through at 51   there are certainly 15 az senators who ll support it and thus it ca nt be changed  this bill gives parity to both sides of the aisle,
80045,i m going to assume that the project is getting a lot of input from people who were ignored for the last couple years andor late additions from people who just walked in the door  typical design by committee bullshit that happen,3
80046,put the team behind the bay bridge project in charge it will become a guaranteed success   hopefully the s wo nt be necessary,1
80047,oh  cboss  communication based overlay signaling system  ptc  positive train control   yea  i personally worked on this project it was not a fun place to work i quit after a year,1
80048,ah the browndogle wasting tax payers money for years to come,
80051,funny how employers get to steal from employees  and if they are caught  they simply have to repay the employee what they are owed nobody gets charged  nobody goes to jail  meanwhile  if an employee steals from an employer  they get charged  fined  and probably spend some time in jail ditto for customers who steal  i wonder why people hate the government and rich people,8
80052,hopefully australia has a similar thing to the usa where prisoners are paid like 47 cents per day,6
80053,not as bad as actual slaves that work in unpaid internships,5
80054,well  when the tpp goes through we ll all get to enjoy such working conditions  the fact of the matter is that this occurs constantly  the authorities refuse to investigate and the workers lack the leverage to bring the employers to court,1
80055,here in the us the government would go after ahmed and not see an issue with what was going on monetarily  edit  some of you really need to step away from the computer and not take this place so seriously,
80056,seriously why are we  the usa  importing workers on visas to work at 711s,
80058,living in germany and studying  i m gon na pay 300   335   for the upcoming semester  these 335  also includes a public transportation ticket  which is in your student id  that allows me to take the train  bus  tram etc at any time as much as i like in my entire state  books are nt nearly as expensive as in the us  the most expensive book i bought last semester was 80   89    but  seriously  95  of the content for the majority of the courses are uploaded on the university s website  files and documents which you can download for free  also  the university canteen offers you decent food for a fair price  normally around 35   in the end my biggest expenses during my semester are the coffees i buy on campu,9
80059,i m from the uk and have lived in germany for 6 years now i came here with a 20000 gbp student loan for a 4 year degree in computer science  now i m about to start a masters in web science that will cost me about 1000 eur for the 2 year course  parttime and remote  i m also just about to get german citizenship  most germans are happy to speak english  i have a job here and although most of the company speak english they make i point of speaking german with me  and i with them  i m not very good at german but am slowly learning now after 5 years of being very lazy about learning the language it s a very hard language to learn  screw those articles   but in time you ll get used to it  i absolutely love speaking to locals in german and being understood by them  to me it s like being on another planet and finally being accepted by the local populus  good luck to anyone who wants to come over  it is a wise move  come and see me near koblenz,9
80060,a friends son went to college in switzerland  we are american  even though he paid additional fees as a non native  and had to travel back and forth to europe  he still paid less than kids who went to local colleges,9
80061,come gather around the fire and listen to a tale of a spooky and simple explanation of our increasing tuition rates in the us  the government started giving student loans kids take the debt  the schools get the money tuition prices increase because they can rely on the kids to get a gov loan take away student loans  then schools ca nt rely on this money  kids ca nt afford the jacked up tuitions  enrollments drop  schools are forced to cut tuition  now more affordable again it s the same problem with mortgage crisis  just a different industry,9
80062,it s almost as if germany sees the benefit of having a well educated work force that is not bogged down by insurmountable debt,9
80063,my college actually sodomizes me,9
80064,whereas here in the states  they will gladly charge you a  250semester parking fee and you will still not actually be guaranteed a space,8
80065,maybe i should go to germany,9
80066,currently living in germany  as an american student on an international internship  what this is nt telling you is that the uni system is significantly different my roommates  all in engineering or other sciences  study all day every day they have a month of exams coming up  and they usually have only one exam per year you fail that  you fail no assignments  projects  etc  just that exam  did i mention this was a fraternity  yeah  they do nt go to uni because everyone does it  like america they work  they get accepted  and they work even more it is nt for partying  it is nt for meeting your spouse or friends  it s for becoming the best you can be  which is how a university should be  good luck to the americans coming here thinking it s anything like the states enjoy the d  ner,9
80067,something like this gets posted everysingleweek without fail and then a bunch of americans start making hasty decisions to just go study in germany because it s  free   oh and it has been this way for years so it is nt a new thing  the german courses that you will have to take for at least a year to reach fluency are around  300 a month and noduolingo is absolutely not enough to get you to the level you need to study at university  the fees for applications are at  75 then an additional 15  for each university you apply to after the first it can go well into the hundreds  the bank account you have to open for your student visa has to have a frozen amount of at least approx   8500 this is nt to say it is impossible but do nt expect roses and rainbows and raining beer amp  wurst to await your easy university life in germany  also american universities except the few ivy leagues or outstanding schools  baby the absolute shit outta you you can pretty much sail smoothly your first two years while you get your core courses out of the way in germany  you jump right into it in german remember  a different language a crazy  difficult language at that the high school diploma is also not equivalent to the german one that allows you to study at a university the equivalent would be a plethora of ap courses with really good grades or a high school diploma plus two years of college with really good grades and then you re equivalent to a german high school graduate  you will also most likely not be able to transfer credits  german bureaucracy  a bitch you will have to have german knowledge when applying for your visas or someone to be a translator there with you  you may have to do a prep year for certain programs as well it is also very competitive to get into even these programs  i sound like fucking scrooge but i ve been through all of it as so have many people i met along the way  it is possible but it will take a lot of hard work and dedication and time that you wo nt regret  losing  because it may not work out perfectly you may get rejected you may not be accepted for that semester a lot of the popular programs have a cap so it s very restricted in terms of amount of students accepted  do nt expect germany to be a country that is just waiting and fiddling its thumbs for the americans to come and study in their unis for  free  and think that they re gon na make it easy for you it is anything but,9
80068,my american husband started learning german at the age of 26 a year later he was admitted to vet school here he s almost finished now we ve been paying 120 euros a semester i think he s the only foreign student to not drop out in his class though the drop out rate is high even for germans while he s happy he is debt free  the immense stress of having to learn a very hard subject in a foreign language and a foreign system  bureaucracy is insane here   have caused many panic attacks and one major case of depression and he has nt even started the huge final exam yet but at least we wo nt be  200k in debt when this is over,8
80069,the fee is actually 150500  per semester books inclusive because of librarys and because we live in 2016 and share digitaly public transport also free  you get 600  per month plus health care  if your parents arent rich  this will be checked by government  as student  and will have to pay back   half of that   in worst conditions after you finished  also  after 3 semesters you must have passed 23 of your finals at any time to get your  baf  g  money  but this will only be checked once no money for extra semesters of course,9
80070,in my opinion let them come here  let them study here and let them stay here if they want besides the fact that the ones who stay make up for the cost of education it is a great way of cultural exchange  it s always nice to have friends from different countries  so if you are coming to the area of n  rnberg just text me ,8
80071,currently living in duisburg  germany and studying at the university of duisburgessen   my choice   i grew up in the us  but my parents are from germany after graduating high school it became apparent that studying in germany was an opportunity that i could not pass up i chose my current uni because it has an international studies in engineering program which allows me to pursue a bachelors degree in computer engineering with the first year taught entirely in english   costs   the costs are definitively low the semester fee  including public transport  is below 300   my total living expenses are below 700  a month and that includes health insurance   my experience so far   keep in my mind i m still in my first semester  as others have mentioned before  the majority of students quit after the first year last year  the failure rate of an exam taken by 200 students was over 95   attending lectures is completely voluntary and there is one exam at the end of each course that makes up 100  of your final course grade no homework is given and you are very much on your own forcing yourself to focus and learn everyday can be a serious challenge  feel free to comment or pm with any questions,7
80072,many american students also come with very false expectations about what german university is like you have to be way more self organised and please do nt expect multiple choice tests,9
80073,we need to stop this immigration because when america sends its people  it sends unskilled people and we have to spend our money on them we are going to build a wall  get america to pay for it and make germany great again,9
80074,you can only offer something for free if you limit supply fewer germans go to college than us students   only 30  of germans ages 2534 have completed a tertiary education  which includes academic degrees and some but not all vocational programs that  s below the oecd average  and below the us 45  attainment rate for the same age group  http  wwwlatimescomlocaleducationcommunitylameedufreecollegeeducationingermanybutnotincalifornia20151029htmlstoryhtml edit  so now i am amused that many people are suggesting that fewer people should go to college in the us  presumably other people  not so much themselves they are smart   it seems like this would be a less popular proposal than promising free tuition,9
80079,how enforceable is this really  what do we do when we find tons of food that turns out to be from an illicit source  destroy it,6

80131,california laughs at your pitiful magnitude 5 earthquakes,5
80132,i m in fresno amp  i felt it ,4
80133,im in east la  i didnt feel it   but watching news rite no,3
80134,we call that tuesda,3
80135,no news here only small towns in the owens valley and it was nt even a moderate temblor,1
80136,little south of fresno and was outside and my neighbor came running out  did you feel that  so we ran and looked at my pool and the water was moving  pretty cool to see that,1
80137,the big one is near and there is reason to fear,1
80138,who cares oklahoma had a 51 the other day and it was nt even anything to write home about,
80139,i moved away from california at the end of december this helps reinforce my decision as a good idea,
80141,for those of you incapable of rtfa before making racist comments  the bride and groom are actors hired by a charity to raise awareness and the 37000day statistic refers to child marriages estimated worldwide not specifically in this local area,9
80142,gt  nearly 15 million girls  some as young as eight or nine so  some as young as eight,9
80143,37000 child marriages every day  if that s the case why are these people shocked  surely they must see these pedo photoshoots on the reg,9
80144,these statistics seem unreliable estimated 12 billion new child marriages by 2050  even taking the 37000 a day estimate at face value that would only get you to 500 million by 2050  i mean seriously  assuming population growth rates remain unchanged  unlikely as the rate is slowing significantly  there will only be  47 billion women born under the age of 8 by 2050 is it truly believable that a quarter of women born in the next 34 years are going to be placed into a child marriage,8
80145,ok this is a serious issue  but fuck the misleading clickbait title,8
80146,paid to act and still goes for the hoverhand,4
80147,as young as nine nine years old damn,4
80148,i doubt half the people even read the article and thought the video was real they were actors and were stopped by plenty of people who called them criminals,6
80149,i just wanted to point out the hand hove,1
80150,where in lebanon was this  looks a bit like beirut if so  i can understand the mixed reactions i would wager the reactions would be less mixed in the northern or southern regions,1
80151,i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country it s picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual some of them just do nt realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do,1
80152,eh personally i m more concerned with men sitting with their legs spread on public transportation that s the real problem,1
80153,at that rate the entire female population of the us would be married off in 11 years certainly 37000 child marriages a day is unsustainable or maybe it s media hype,1
80154,the religion of peaceand pedophiliaand rapeand beheadingsand suicide bombingsand mass executions,
80155,pakistan tried to pass a law banning child marriages and the clerics said   nope  the koran says as soon as a girl menstruates  she can be dtf whoever she s married to  so you re not allowed to pass a law like that  so they took it back and child marriage continues to be legal,
80156,woody allen is dating again,1
80157,what wrong with this prophet mohammad had sex with a nine year old child  prophet is perfect do nt be blinded by secularism  thats what an apologist would say and its true the prophet liked them youn,

80159,no one cares it s over ther,
80160,these clickbait titles are getting out of hand,
80161,are these the people you want flooding your country on a daily basis  are these the kinds of values that america will benefit from importing,
80162,lol this is nt normal in lebanon and that is clear from the video these people are actor,
80163,its funny how the muslims in the video oppose this even though the greatest man that has ever lived  mohammed  has actually married a child around that age,
80164,honestly what s the big deal this is a tradition going back thousands of years why stop it now,
80165,someone post this on rfeminism and see where that fuse leads too i would but i been banned for positing stuff that does nt fit the narrativ,
80166,i thought this was child to child marriage   still fucked up but at least that s not as bad as this,
80167,once a girl has her period  nature has decided she can be a parent or a bride that s a hard fact for most to swallow nature gives no shits about how our culture has changed,
80169,fucking sad how this was nt described as an act of terrorism i guess that title is reserved for nonchristians,9
80170,it is sad that it closed even for a short time people like fiorina do nt give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time,8
80171,definitely not terrorism though  just a little rampage  you know he was probably having a bad day or something,8
80172,good for them  dont let those freedom hating assholes scare you away from your job,8
80173,how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him,4
80174,is carly out of the race yet  i do nt think that rightwing  fringe conartist is done riling up her terrorist sect,6
80175,deadly rampage  was  terrorist attack  a little too onthenose,6
80176,why does this headline say  deadly rampage  and not  christian terrorism ,6
80177,now i m not a fan of abortions but who the hell can think to themselves i know how to stop babies from being aborted  i ll just shoot all the moms and their doctors  absolute lunatic,3
80178,thank god its back open now we can get back to crushing fetus  heads and sucking their brains out like normal people,
80179,on president s day   the gaul,
80180,so  someone went on a shooting rampage and killed people in order to stop planned parenthood from killing people  but now planned parenthood is open again  and proudly killing people  well  i am glad that worked out the entire thing makes tons of sense,
80181,pp is where there is regular deadly rampages against unborn babies,
80182,planned parenthood is basically condoms and the oklahoma city bombing,
80185,just wait until they get their   1495 outage restoration surcharge  on the next bill,9
80186,comcast   so what  it s not like you can leave me,9
80187,comcast is used to pissing people off they wo nt give a fuck,9
80188,you could probably just sticky this post  have no link from it or replies available that is how permanent of an issue this is,9
80189,we want google fiber and we want it now,9
80190,if a telephone company has this large a problem  they have to meet with the fcc and show cause most likely there would also be a hefty fine but  not cable networks because they are deemed nonessential,7
80191,not news to me i have a 3 hour outage at least once a month with comcast a 1020 minute outage daily around 56 am  and at least 34 10 minute outages sprinkled throughout the week  i know this because 2 out of every 5 or 6 dvr recorded shows are fucked up during the middle   absolutely awful i live in a moderate city  too  so it s not like i m in the middle of fucking nowhere,7
80192,and then they wonder why people are ready to go to google fibe,7
80193,loss of internet and television access for 3 days would cause mass panic and riot,8
80194,my bad people i went over my 300gb and used way too much of an infinite resource,7
80195,wow  17k outages nationwide for as much as 3 hours  obama needs to step in and fix this for sure ,9
80196,gt  across us i bet i could find thousands who are angry at comcast  in my town alone ,5
80197,i m fully expecting to get downvoted to hell here  but what the heck  i m not particularly fond of comcast  but unless i missed something here  which is entirely possible   this does nt actually sound like it was particularly horrific for people in general it sounds like a very small fraction of their nationwide customer base  had an outage of parts of their service for about 3 or 4 hours  not even all of their service  but things like they could nt access their hd channels  or their internet did nt work for a few hours  i understand for businesses  an internet outage can be a big deal  so some outrage on their part would be justified  but for the general consumer  come on  get a grip go read a book for a while  or go outside for a bit  or  gasp  go do something with your family  i m just not getting what the huge deal was here  what am i missing,7
80198,i was part of the outage did nt have internet and only had access to about 8 sd channels i ll be honest  3 hours where i have to use my phone for internetsi could nt care less had to go out and shovel anyway  edit  couldgt  could n,7
80199,not a fan of comcast  but with this outage they probably still provide 9999  uptime bunch of whiners  yes  i work in it,6
80200,i like how this is news in this country,7
80201,comcast angers me even without outages,7
80202,the words  anger  and  comcast  come up often,4
80203,there needs to be legally mandated uptime and speed requirements  95  of the time your connection must reach the  advertised  speed  no more  up to xmbps  allowed  and 99  of the time it must reach 14 of that speed if this is nt met then customers must be completely refunded for that month,4
80204,is anyone else still completely fucking down  just everything  been down for 15 hours here,4
80205,quote from the article   comcast has more than 27 million customers  and 89000 of those are new cable subscribers the company signed on last quarter that was its best performance in eight years  correct me if i m wrong but are nt there 2 choices for most people  sign up with comcast or do nt have high speed internet  it s like bragging because people choose to eat food from the only supplier rather than starve to death,4
80206,comcast seems to be an isp that people love to hate  charter got so bad for so many years that i loved to hate them in all honesty  the past three to four years or so they have been great,7
80207,customer service replied   working as intended,3
80208,i ve had comcast xfinity for almost 2 years now and i ve never had an issue,5
80209,fun story i was at a friend s place watching the superbowl in denver comcast blacked out cbs with 1 minute 26 seconds left on the clock in second quarter  and service was nt restored till about 15 seconds before 3rd quarter kicked off  idk how widespread this was but lots of denverites did nt get to see the super bowl halftime show i d imagine comcast would lose a lot of money if their advertisers paid to have a certain amount of views and one of the biggest markets  since denver was participating in the super bowl  cut out all views during the entire halftime show idk how their whole contract with that stuff goes though  i hear i did nt miss much though,1
80210,that s what happens things go out sometimes,3
80211,friend of mine called to ask why he couldnt connect  he obviously cant check if there are outages in his neighborhood without the internet  he calls them and they offer to send a tech to his house for like  80  they didnt tell him the price  but you know itd be up there  he spends an hour checking all his connections  digging through paperwork to find his modem settings page  finally calls back about 8hrs later hoping to talk to someone else and theyre like   oh yeah  there s an outage in your area   idiots,1
80212,when i called  i was disconnected 3 times this is great customer nonservice beside the lack of tv thanks comcast for helping me make my change from you  easier,1
80213,it s nothing new that comcast absolutely sucks,1
80214,when you deal with technology  there is only one thing i can guarantee you it will get down at the worst possible time,1
80215, compact angers thousands across the us for something other than just being comcast for once  ftf,1
80216,they just put a data cap on my home internet how fucked is that  pretty fucked if you ask me,1
80217,what is the most troubling about comcast is that when there is an outtage  it doesnt effect just a small region  but instead downs multiple states that seems so rediculous,1
80218,once they fix the outage you re left with  comcast anger thousands across us,1
80219,now only 1000 years to lrrr ruler of the planet omicron persei 8 comes to destroy earth,1
80220,it s not like we re losing  that  much more bandwidth it s only like 20 megs less than what we had before which was only 80 megs less than what we re paying for,1
80221,so  i had to get comcast recently because i moved and noticed something weird about my bill the letter in the mail has a different due date than the due date that shows up on the online account just saying folks make sure to pay 2 days before your date at least,1
80222,just having comcast in general makes them angry,1
80223, nsfw how comcast really feels   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  kmcny_pixdw,1
80224,once in a while fios is out for a few hours hard to get too pissed  these things do happen i do nt think comcast needs an outage to be hated honestly though for me they were a decent provider  i never had a single issue with them except for the occasional outage,1
80225,wow now that s comcastic,1
80226,it was out for like 3 hours jesus christ,1
80227,my comcast service  for the first time in years  has actually been pretty good lately but i d like to pay less  so i m rooting for google fiber to come to boston simply so i can reap the benefits of competition  i mean  that s what we really want  right  we do nt want yet another monopoly  no matter how  altruistic  we think google will be  we want the existing monopolies to be forced into providing quality service for a reasonable price  along with other choices,1
80228,it probably still worked better than my centurylink ds,1
80229,comcast s response   it pays the restoration fee  or else it gets the hose again,1
80230,my case  as in many others  boils down to this  you can pay triple the amount for the same throughput speeds or you can curse comcast and wait for google fiber,1
80231,at the same time  i would nt want to be on the other end and get screamed at from 10k  people experiencing the outage i just went out instead of being at home it s aggregating that it happens so often  at the same time there are other things to d,1
80232,they should just switch providers if they are nt satisfied  see what i did there ,1
80233,after this comcast will just be turning off their services everywhere after all  they could save a ton of money that way,1
80234,for comcast  it was tuesday,1
80235,spread your cheeks  most of you wo nt even complain or ask for a billing credit,1
80236,title should just be  comcast angers thousands across us   i fucking hate comcast with every fiber of my being  reasons  i  paying top dollar for slow as shit internet  ii  a modemrouter combo that broadcasts an unsecured public network from your home which has to be manually deactivated  iib  said modem has to be forced reset once a week  and doing so undoes the manual changes you made to get rid of the second network  iii  arbitrary data caps  iv  live television that freezes  v  ondemand that works infrequently  and turns into minecraft porn when it crashes  vi  customer  service  that refuses to listen to what your problem is  but instead tries to upsell you on a more advanced package  one of my dreams is to live long enough to see this shit stain regional monoploy of a company implode upon itself  or be run straight into the fucking grave by google fiber,1

80248,the entitlement attitude of so many americans  gt  if it was me  i would have probably escorted this procession to the burial  your funeral escort was driving without a valid license the chp was correct to pull him over and cite him the rest of the funeral procession was free to continue on but you chose to pull over instead that was your own decision that caused you to be late the funeral  what is so aggravating to me about this is the family will file a lawsuit and probably win they will get to think they are right but they will milk the taxpayers of thousands of dollars,1

80280,tl  dr  apple has to provide the means to extract encrypted data from the device fbi will then try to decrypt it  i assume by brute force  would would be easy for a 4digit pin   the interesting part is that the device is owned by farook s employer  the san bernardino county department of public health had they been following proper device protocol  they would already have administrator access to it  this was literally government property used for terrorism  and now unsearchable not due to the  encryption  boogeyman but their own ineptitude,7
80281,gt  the judge ruled tuesday that the cupertinobased company had to provide  reasonable technical assistance  to the government in recovering data from the iphone 5c  including bypassing the autoerase function and allowing investigators to submit an unlimited number of passwords in their attempts to unlock the phone apple has five days to respond to the court if it believes that compliance would be  unreasonably burdensome  so it sounds like the government does nt think apple can bypass it for them  just make it easier for them to brute force i bet judge s ruling will hold up  too,4
80282,i have this hunch that this is all for show and that the fbi has access through the nsa to all of this stuff why would they cancel prism  it s not like your average citizen can inspect the electronic infrastructure of this country and verify that  for example  metadata collection has stopped i think after edward snowden they sat in a room and decided to keep doing it and act like they were stopping it i would  i sound like a conspiracy theorist but i really do think the risks of terrorism are so great and siphoning data so easy that they re still doing it,1

80290,i have spent some time among the government arab workers of these nations and i have no pity for the trials that lie ahead of them in the real world  they wielded their unearned wealth with a brash arrogance  putting themselves above other races with a disgusting assumption that they were somehow favored by god  and therefore inherently better than others in fact  it was equally distasteful for them when an american did  not  wield their racenationality with a pompous arrogance because this undermined their own claim to legitimacy  this was not some single unpleasant person i dealt with it was the overwhelming majority out of 100 citizens  there were maybe 5 people who had enough wisdom and openmindedness to question such an absurd world view  for example  on a hot day i was supervising pakistani and indian workers doing our manual labor for us  as it would have been unbecoming for an arab and an american to be doing manual labor i took some of our cold water bottles we had in our cooler and offered them to the workers  but was stopped by one of the head guys  do nt do that   he warned me shaking his head his message was clear  he did nt want the workers to get used to that treatment  i witnessed minorities berated and even physically accosted at times only americans and british were spared from the cruel racism that pervades the arab world it seeps into your daily life and if you live in it long enough you even start to internalize it ugh  i am looking forward to the cold splash of reality to wash over that region and wake many of those intolerant people up from their slumber,7

80294,have done some research in saudi echoing similar things everybody wants government jobs  but the government is trying to push private sector employment  so you end up with many saudis who do nt do anything showing up on payrolls and there s a somewhat true perception that most companies would prefer to hire foreigners  who will work harder  over citizens  not sure what the longterm solution is for the employment problems  but crashing oil revenue is definitely going to make things worse will be interesting to see if government is going to start shrinking public sector employment more heavily,5

80357,from the regressive left s perspective  by censoring and silencing opposing opinions  especially those from sources merely  perceived  as not being   progressive   regressive enough  they are allowing for  traditionally oppressed groups  to   be used as a mouthpiece that ca nt be challenged because of cries of racism   speak  just as long as they say the correct    progressive   regressive things ,

80363,yeah if my big illegal bag of money was heavier  i d totally reconsider all the crime i do to obtain large bags of money it just would nt be worth the hassle,7
80364,thank you but fuck no it s bad enough carrying around 100s to go buy cars amp  bikes on craigslist  now you want me to carry boxes of 20s   the  100 has plenty of legitimate uses  no need to make things harder for the 999  of the population that s lawabiding,9
80365,thats why they got rid of the  500 billand it didnt work so well,8
80366,keep marijuana and cocaine illegal  it s the 100 dollar bills that are the problem,7
80367,i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four  5000 bills instead of two  10000 was too taxing better go straight,8
80368,clearly  100 bills are the problem,7
80369,people still listen to larry summers  i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008 or does cnn still think repealing glasssteagall was a good idea,7
80370,it s not about stopping criminals it s about controlling peoples money with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically this is what done in europe to prevent  tax fraud ,7
80371,might aswell remove any chemicals or equipment in the world that can make drugs aswell larry summers idea is stupid  it would nt just hurt criminals  it would hurt the innocent people aswell,7
80372,in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the  100 bill it is very popular outside the us,5
80373,the new blue  100 bills are too cool to replace,5
80374,80  of the money supply being in  100 bills is the key statement this would likely be the first  and easiest  step to killing paper currency this is one of the initial hurdles to overcome  because they do nt give a fuck about it being tough on criminals  come on  when looking to implement negative interest rates,8
80375,the thing about secondary labor markets  drugs  gambling  prostitution  etc  is that prohibition is what causes the main problems related to them these are black markets that will always have demand as long as the activities are forced underground by punitive policy  and that demand will always find a way around obstacles  making life marginally more difficult for the suppliers is only doing to make the products more dangerous  not less desirable,5
80376,that is the most twisted logic   no more  100 bills  guess i ll stop dealing crack,5
80377,okay larry last time we listened to you we deregulated the banks in 1999 nah larry  i m not gon na listen to you,5
80378,make it illegal for poor people to ever have cash money so that you can freeze their accounts when their name shows up on the noflylist  eh  they already ca nt buy a car in cash without the dealership informing on them to the feds,6
80379,how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds   ,4
80380,i urge everybody here to watch inside job  it will shock you on how thoroughly corrupt this dude is  along with his buddies on wall street washington now he wants the gov to ban the  100 because of nirp  he does nt give a fuck about criminals using those or tax evasions do not listen to what this turd says,4
80381,attention  we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash  except pennies   cash is privacy and should be a basic right,1
80382,i wonder what larry would think about paul krugman s onetime pet project  the  trilliondollar coin   http  krugmanblogsnytimescom20130107bereadytomintthatcoin  _r  0 ,5
80383,is something going on with all the major currencies  i saw a similar story about the euro notes too  http  wwwdailymailcoukwiresreutersarticle3448066ecbconsidersscrapping500euronotehtml also http  wwwdailymailcouknewsarticle3437590banksurgedban50notesbidendcashhandculturehelprecoupbillionstaxtreasuryhtml all these stories within a week of each other  i would nt be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency,3
80384,currently in colorado  hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash,3
80385,scrap larry summers  and get rid of a criminal,3
80386,the only relevance to crime is the idea itself scam to grab more control of your money  bankster shenanigans do nt fall for it,3
80387,the banks love this this means less people holding cash and more money that they can use to fuck us over remember folks  the rules are changing so that the money on deposit with banks is legally not yours if there s a bank failure  your money will be used to bail out the banks  the move is simply an extension of the war on cash,3
80388,the fed stopped printing any bills higher than  100 in 1945 they began destroying the larger denominations actively in 1969  100 in 1945 is equivalent to  1300 today adjusting for inflation frankly they should be talking about issuing a  200 and  500 bill  if not also a  1000 bill,3
80389,larry summers should be in prison  he is one of the architects of the 2008 collapse he also was instrumental in the repeal of glasssteagall the world would be better off without this fool and his dangerous ideas  http  wwwsourcewatchorgindexphp  title  larry_summer,3
80390,does larry mean wall st criminals  of course not  white male entitlement it s what larry is all about unfortunately obama was dumb enough to bring summers into his administration where he flailed about  lamely attempting to cover upmake excuses as to why the theater burned down in 2008 with the financial  masters of the universe  still inside  larry proved his overall dumbness by predicting 2011 would be  recovery summer   based on nothing  no evidence just his  expert  opinion  there was no recovery in 2011,3
80391,bring back the  500 and  1000 dollar bills dammit,3
80392,larry summers  ladies and gentlemen one of the masterminds of financial deregulation is now proposing another hair brained idea summers  go clone yourself so you can go fuck yourself,3
80393,just legalize crime everybody wins,3
80394,fuk this illuminati puppe,4
80395,the bulk of the value of cash in circulation is from  100 s get rid of cash and the fed can do any crazy policy it wants this is a necessary step towards negative interest rates nobody believes the government gives two shits about money laundering  florida real estate laws and hsbc getting zero criminal charges shows that is not the case,3
80396,banksters do nt even use cash oh wait you re talking about the little criminals carry on,4
80397,another attempt by the wealthy to outlaw cash our money is nt our money  according to the elite,5
80398,then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination ,3
80399,scrap the two  the single  the penny  half dollar and nickel instead,3
80400,scrap the drugs too  make them illegal  oh wait,1
80401,but they just click buttons on a computer and create and move money around  wait  what,1
80402,than how will our government and cia function,1
80403,interning theory main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks,1
80404,singapore has had the 10000 singapore dollar bill for some time it is still legal tender  but is going to be phased out slowly old notes will not be replaced  this is a calculated strategy by the sg government to comply with international counterterrorism and anti money laundering efforts  but minimising their own vulnerability to regulatory arbitrage,1
80405,is nt the  100 bill the staple of american foreign trade  i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like  interestfree  loans  though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ,1
80406,politicians do nt use  100s so how could it harm criminals,1
80407,what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then,1
80408,gt  the  100 bill is actually the second most common us bill in circulation  behind the  1 bill  gt  nearly 80  of the  14 trillion of us currency in circulation is in  100 bills much of it is held outside the united states  i m no math magician  but this does nt seem to fit,1
80409,yeah  just watch  they will scrap it right down to the 20  anyone who wants to make largeish purchases will have to use electronic accounts that can be tracked  oh yeah   because crime  not  because government needs to track your every move,1
80410,this is one of those ideas that seems silly at first but the more you think of it  the more it makes some sense,1
80411,this is stupid  criminals will make due with what ever currency there is  they do nt fucking care and any one who thinks otherwise is a desk jocky looking for something to do,1
80412,switch to all coins while you re at it if  100 weighed an ounce   1600 would weigh a pound  1 mil would weigh 625 lbs,1
80413,larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone,1
80414,how would this effect the bitcoin market,1
80415,this is about getting rid of cash  not making life tougher for criminals that way  when the fed institutes negative interest rates  you the lowly consumer will be forced to spend your savings to avoid being charged for saving,1
80416,funny thing  today also the eu central bank ceo emanuele prodi announced that 500 euro bills are to be outphased for the same reason apparently american criminals manage to launder money with a bill that s 6 times less in value  is nt this just a global banking scheme to rob us the power over our own money,1
80417,yes those evil people in government would love to get rid of cash and make everyone just use electronic money because then  the bank has your money and you only have an iou which they may  or may not  pay you back in the future  look at cyprus in 2013 where people did nt get their full deposited funds back because of the financial crisis  also they can charge you negative interest rateswhich means you have to pay for the bank to hold your funds  and of course if the govt has your money  then they have a great deal more power over you in deciding whether they should be nice and give it back to you or not  this is another reason why bitcoin is good  although they will ban that long before they ban cash,1
80418,now  whatchall wan na do  wan na be ballers  shotcallers  brawlers  who be dippin in the benz wit tha spawlers,
80419,hmm sounds like portable bitcoin exchange devices would be cool carry a bitcoin wallet in a little  5 raspberry pilike thing with an lcd display  hook it up to another  punch in transfer codes  both devices show  are you sure   both people hit yes  see the verification displayed  and bill sizes become irrelevant and everybody can keep negotiating with cash when buying motorcycles off craigslist no matter what these control freak asshats try to pull,
80420,you can still buy silver and gold anonymously  and cash out up to  1500 worth at one time with no tax penalty,
80421,but  but  how will weezy and drizzy write raps now if they ca nt talk about dem big faces,
80423,it s time to play rnews or rjokes,5

80425,and darth vader amp  freddie kruger were left free  where s the justice ,1
80427,they do not care what police do with them  they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them  edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create  that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all  they do not care about you you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle,8
80428,why this has 58 upvotes when some stupid shit about a teen  affluenza  case has 4000  i can not fathom priorities  people,7
80429,where is the tipping point for police state,7
80430,the stingray is just one of  many   https  theinterceptcomsurveillancecatalogue  devices used by our governmental police agencies against us,8
80431,good ole harris  i m glad they have branched out from raking the military over the coals for their radios and now get the law enforcement agencies for the stingray,4
80432,alex jones brought this up long ago  yet hes a kook though right,1
80433,what is the point of all this secrecy  this stuff always comes out,1
80435,14 billion years    so what am i suppose to tell them when i get called in for a tax audit 15 billion years from now and my records only go back 14 billion years,7
80436,another  holographic storage  for us to hear about for 20 years that wo nt materialize in our lifetimes it s a bummer  removable archival media seems like it is really stagnant,6
80437,yes  but will there be a  reader  for that disc in 14 billion years,6
80438,i always love when brand new technologies claim forever,4
80439,cool  take all of humankind  audio  video and written text  and burn it to a couple of discs store several copies of it on the moon  along with a radio beacon should humanity get wiped out  we ll have left something for future generations to discover  no need to build giant pyramids,4
80440,wish someone would actually do thi,1

80443,when can i buy a burner  i have to move onto my next project  archiving the world s vast array of porn,
80445,i hope they get it right and protest the us department of education if student loans are your issue  go straight to the source of your ills ironically enough  the only way to end student debt is to scale down and eventually eliminate the student loan program,7
80446, protesters lose jobs for not showing up to work  arrested for nonpayment,7
80447,i see payday loans taking this route soon,5
80448,did nt we get rid of debtor s prisons  i m confuse,4
80449,i believe this happened as i heard this story from other news sources  but some info had to be left out or missing in the us if you owe money on a debt the personcompany has seven years to collect if they do nt the debt disappears if they take you to court and get a judgement they have ten years to collect and it can be renewed for ten more years the only way he could be arrested is if the loan company took him to court  won a judgement and then took further action to force the debtor to court this would not be something to come out of the blue,3
80450,more from the professional  victim class  i guess you need something to do in between police shootings and sanders rallies,4
80452,it says tourism is still banned there are 12 categories of authorized travel but what are those categories  cargo  family,6
80453,idklooks like cuba has a future in manufacturing to mejust a hunch,5
80454,so there is no sex tourism like before the embargo yet,
80455,give the castros their money and let them build paper towns while the real population continues to suffer,
80456,obama wants to follow through on at least one major campaign promiseto close guantanamo bay this is part of his plan to make that happen  i m glad we re ending the pointless cold war era policy  it s long overdue and it ll be nice to have havana as a tourist destination again  viva cuba,
80457,cuba is going on the vacation list i bet there s a ton of secluded beaches that have nt been trashed yet by countless tourists,
80459,this makes sense a lot of people in science fields relating to cancer formation  such as radiology and medicinal biology  are of the opinion that most cancerous tumors are actually quietly killed by the body before they can reach critical mass to defend themselves  and the ones that prove dangerous are the ones that either do nt register to t cells or which grow too quickly to be snuffed to simplify  the reasons for this are simple  not everyone dies from cancer  and everyone gets exposed to carcinogens given the rate of mutation  the influence of radiation  the amount of background radiation  etc  that everyone is unavoidably exposed to  we should all develop tumors if there is a true casual relationship if you simply say that the body is helpless against them naturally  we would all die from cancer the body  must  be defending itself from them given that we do nt  in fact  it s basically accepted as scientific truth cancer is nt simply the presence of cancerous tumors  it s the presence of cancerous tumors that have the right surrounding cells  in the right quantity  that do nt die from immune system intervention and which have favorable growth conditions most small tumors simply do nt have the right conditions  and die studies have confirmed that the ones that register as cancer are a subset of all tumors that might form  because this subset avoids the usual limiting factors  so  going back to the article  this is simply taking the bodies natural process for fighting tumors and guiding it to specific cancers it might normally miss and saying  go get it   then praying you did nt just kill the poor sap with his now manically overenthusiastic immune system,6
80460,gt  the treatment involves removing the tcells from patients  tagging them with  receptor  molecules that target cancer  and putting them back into the body in an infusionthe targeting molecules  known as chimeric antigen receptors or cars  came from specially bred genetically engineered mice   gt  in one study  94 percent of participants suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia  all  said their symptoms vanished completely after they were treated with the modified blood cells  known as tcells  it looks like this could be a very  very big deal i m surprised that  as of this comment  this post is not getting much attention,7
80461,now they just need to find a way to reverse liver cirrhosis and i can live forever,1
80462,this is a breakthrough right up until the pharmaceutical companies buy the process and tuck it away forever  there s no money to be made in curing a disease,1
80463,i m rather hopeful that we ll be able to cure most cancers within the next 20 years or so  and hopefully before that we ll have something that wo nt cure it but will reliably halt cancer so that a patient can just wait for the actual cure to be found  as with we do with hiv i believe  maybe i m being too optimistic  but you got ta be optimistic about something in this miserable world,1
80465,well  that ought to take care of the problem,1
80466,i like that guy after all  i would only do it for the money with minimal violence  and would never want to kill people so  if i ever decide to go and work for a cartel  i m  definitely  working for el jesus,1
80467,is he hiring mercenaries  or he has enough already  it s also not a problem to join any military  as they re all doing god s work,1
80468,well  if their since could nt be instantly forgiven  that might have had weight,1

80474,god  this pisses me off gay marriage has nothing to do with you what two gay people do in the comfort of their own homes is none of your business,6
80475,being thrown out by supreme court in 321,5
80476,gt  the state senate rules committee passed a sweeping  religious freedom  bill on tuesday that would allow faithbased nonprofits that receive public funds to discriminate against lgbt people  what a fucking joke tax dollars will literally be spent discriminating against gay people because of this bill jesus  without the civil rights act the south would still be embracing segregation and hiding behind a bastardized interpretation of the first amendment then as well,1
80477,it s fun that the government has turned the words freedom and patriot in to code words for tyrannical  and selfish,1
80478,okay  i m not american  but did nt the senate legalise homosexual marriage  so is nt this unconstitutional,1
80479,allowing people to do what they want with their own property is nt antigay  it s profreedom and proequality the right to follow your on conscience is as fundamental as the right to follow your own gender identity equality under the law is as far as laws should go,1
80480,can anyone say hillbilly,
80481,i have 2 problems with this a  fair and equal treatment isnt a right hate to say it  but people are assholes would i refuse to serve someone based on some character trait  no is it still my right to refuse to serve anyone i dont like  assuming that it s my buisiness   you bet your ass it is it s not a smart buisiness plan  but the law doesnt require that i be smart b  how the fuck would someone know that youre gay  i mean  sure some people might fit every single stereotype  but that doesnt mean that they are gay unless they specifically ask  are you gay  and you reply  yes  i am homosexual   which again  is not required by law   how would they be able to destinguish your sexuality  this whole bill is just too messy for my likin,
80482,man  why do the people who run this state have to be such major assholes,
80483,as a citizen i propose that when every you meet someone from the state legislature  just turn around and fart at them,

80493,no news here only small towns in the owens valley and it was nt even a moderate temblor,1
80494,little south of fresno and was outside and my neighbor came running out  did you feel that  so we ran and looked at my pool and the water was moving  pretty cool to see that,1
80495,the big one is near and there is reason to fear,1
80496,who cares oklahoma had a 51 the other day and it was nt even anything to write home about,
80497,i moved away from california at the end of december this helps reinforce my decision as a good idea,

80502,china should just rename the street in front of the us embassy snowden ave problem solved,8
80503,here on the west coast we re already getting serious fallout from china s fucking pollution,7
80504,call their bluff fuck you  china,6
80505,just for that threat  we re gon na make the plaza address number  6489,3
80506,sure  right after they undo those artificial islands,1
80507,go invade another peaceful country  china  then blame them again,4
80508,serious fallout  like the nuclear fallout that would be spread over the entirety of the east and the pacific ocean if anyone in china decides it s time to do anything concrete against the us  we ll destroy the fucking world while laughing about it and accusing you of fault,4
80509,what are wechina s lil bitch  i dont think another country should have implications on our freedom of speech if anything this makes me want this place to be renamed,
80511,now there is a precedence i hope apple can appeal this    ,1
80512,i m 100  fine with this i ca nt believe they need apple though unless they want everything done legally,1
80514,cant ever trust cops you cant tell me that no one in the police dept knew this was happening they are all a bunch of child molesting bullies and there should be a reform on the police system in america  the government uses chemtrails to numb us to the police brutality that happens infront of us  every day  and soon we will be living in a facist policestate society controlled by the good ol boys club  if we dont elect jill stein this year  extend the presidential term limits and gxd bless america    edit      oops  i thought it said  sherrif man    point still stands though,
80516,if the proposal came from a doctor or scientist  i would be 100  on the side of this bill but it comes from a senator  which makes me want to question it  scientific papers require peer review from the most qualified people to call bullshit on an idea before you can get it published as legitimate i m not saying i m questioning the idea  but i do nt know enough about the process of bills and laws to give it my automatic seal of approval  i think it s a good idea to administer anesthesia to an unborn human that can feel pain whether or not it increases the cost of abortion but the cost is still a talking point all i can do is hope that the people in charge of the decision in the end have the same concerns that i do,8
80517,i mean  we already use anesthesia on fetuses when performing surgery in the womb for exactly this reason  so it s hardly surprising  http  wwwdoctorsonfetalpaincomfetalpaintheevidence5documentatio,7
80518,wether a fetus is under anesthesia is completely dependent on the type of anesthetic being performed any general anesthetic also anesthetizes the fetus while other types like spinal or local do not even then  there is no accurate way to quantify or measure awareness in fetuses  much less adults undergoing anesthesia the body also still responds to pain under anesthesia  as its an autonomic response  so the definition of  feeling pain  is not something that should be measured i feel like awareness  which is impossible to measure in a fetus regardless  is a real idicator of humanity an easy solution would be to simply do all elective abortions under general anesthesia  which may cost more  but is easily doable i have no idea what the preferred method of anesthesia is  if any  for elective abortions  source  i do anesthesia in a catholic hospital,5
80519,i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them,7
80520,they have nt decided at what point of gestation this would happen  gt  montana lawmakers passed a similar law in 2015 requiring fetal anesthesia before surgeries  including abortion  after 20 or more gestational weeks  so  4 months the general consensus for viability outside the womb is around 6 monthsish for some the concept of consciousness coincides with viability outside the womb,6
80521, this is a review on fetal pain   http  jamajamanetworkcomarticleaspx  articleid  201429amp  resultclick  1  from clinical review  although it is 10 years old it says  gt  evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques similarly  limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion,5
80522,is nt this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor s office  would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder,5
80523,ignorant people propose bill based on said ignorance,
80524,i m going to talk about this as delicately as possible i  genuinely  want thoughts and opinions on this subject  i am asking that no one become immediately offended by what i m about to say rather than respond with your opinion telling me why you believe that my view should change i am childfree i do nt want kids  i m 35  so it s pretty much set in stone at this juncture in my life i do nt see myself as a prolife or prochoice supporter and the reason for that is because i kind of agree with both sides on one hand i firmly believe that the destruction of a human being  born or not  is murder it fits the definition  of  murder before you downvote me into oblivion  let me be clear it s not the votes i care about it s that you understand where i m coming from even though i have that belief  i also believe that some people were just not meant to be children but therein lies another debate  why do nt they place it in adoption  because most of the time unwanted children are kept  they re not placed into adoption and when they re kept their chances of being neglected as children  whether it be mentally  emotionally  or physically  rise exponentially i certainly would nt want to have a child and resent it i  do nt  have children because frankly i m mean as a damn snake i do nt see any part of me that could ever have a child and not lose my temper with it and i would nt put a kid through that  because  i  was put through that i would be a horrible parent  anyway  i have a point i swear if you re going to have an abortion  why anesthetize it first  do i believe that it can feel  absolutely  but you re killing it i mean it s not like you re putting it to sleep and saying   here  fight for your life  you re fucking killing it so why have a crisis of conscience about it  again  i m sorry if i offend anyone  that s not my intention i m just a realistic person and it is what it is sugarcoating it does nt change it the bill seems like a waste of time and tax dollars  edit  i do nt understand why this is being downvoted so  please  give me your views instead of leaving me wondering because if there s something i m not understanding it needs to be made clear again this is absolutely not about the votes rather than having a discussion,
80525,if you pinch a fetus it will cry so that pretty much proves they feel pai,
80526,because that makes it okay  smh,
80528,i m going to assume that the project is getting a lot of input from people who were ignored for the last couple years andor late additions from people who just walked in the door  typical design by committee bullshit that happen,3
80529,put the team behind the bay bridge project in charge it will become a guaranteed success   hopefully the s wo nt be necessary,1
80530,oh  cboss  communication based overlay signaling system  ptc  positive train control   yea  i personally worked on this project it was not a fun place to work i quit after a year,1
80531,ah the browndogle wasting tax payers money for years to come,
80533,they need stricter gun control,1
80535,in this case  i hope what happens in vegas stays in vegas,7
80536,man  if this was the best the americans could offer for rebellion  we might as well embrace fascism the government is far smarter than these guys  guy loses both his kids  and freaks out  leaves  petoria   http  familyguywikiacomwikipetoria   and gets popped is nt there a tvtropes page about this,1
80537,all the air out of the takeover lol,4
80538,lock him in prison for a long time,1
80539,yes  let him wait for trial on his ranch that will definitely work out well,
80541,they can still go to the doctor and get the scans on their ow,1
80543,yes please too big to fail means they are too big  period break them apart,8
80544,this seems like a no brainer not saying it will be easy  but why ever have banks too large to fail even exist,9
80545,absolutely agree  but it will likely go nowhere it really is nt any different than when the government stepped in and broke up atamp  t into the baby bells unfortunately  this is talk by those who have no power to enforce change,6
80546,seems like a good move if you re too big to fail  you are clearly in violation of antitrust and monopoly legislation  surely  plus  anything that is too big to fail is clearly just a bad idea from the standpoint of a societies ability to sustain unexpected shocks and surprises,7
80547,big banks and wall street bank elections for both parties not going to happen unless supreme court reverses  citizens united  ruling allowing corporations to donate unlimited amount of funds to politicians and political parties as long as such bribery is legal  no politician will bite the hand that feeds himher,4
80548,this is a political talking point floated to make sanders look like an over reactor if andor when he loses the nomination this guy and his idea will disappear from sight,5
80549,hopefully  his floating that idea wo nt end up with him floating in the river,4
80550,kashkari  eh  so  how does goldman sachs make money off of this,4
80551,eh  wake me when they actually start breaking them up for now this is just more idle talk,4
80552,i guess they could nt find a picture that makes him look crazier,4
80553,if there are any economists here  i have a question how do we know that this wo nt have the same results as breaking up telecoms  regional monopolies collude until one is more successful and one starts to fail the successful one buys the failing one then this process repeats until the most successful one is enormous again  but with writeoffs  layoffs and debts thanks to the less successful ones consumers get screwed by footing the bill for the whole failed experiment  if telecoms can do that  why would we assume that banks wo nt just do the same thing  to the effect of even more pain for consumers,4
80554,oh hey  it s the guy who ran for california governor,3
80555,news update  spontaneous fires erupt in rome,3
80556,no if we break up banks or make them have more capital  they will invest less  and folks on reddit will say its too hard to get a loan the banks will now actually want to make sure folks can actually pay back the loan  and a lot of folks have no assets  and will cry its not fair   only the rich are getting the loans    since they already have assets   are you sure you want to hold banks accountable  personally  i think its a great idea  but not sure you all realize the banks will just push that accountability back on you,3
80557,that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money,1
80558,probably not that big of a problem anymore they ve plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 20 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become,1
80559,looks as though he s beginning a political career as a goldman  fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him asshole,1
80560,breaking up huge banks reduces the chance that banks will get the giant bailouts the did after 2008 failures  massive corporate welfare they will lobby hard against the potential loss of a free ride,1
80561,godless commie socialism yes pleas,1
80562, flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca nt fail  did anyone else see this   wtf  so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further,1
80563,trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it,1
80564,from my armchair  i d say that the entire banking sector needs to be deleveraged 301 leverage  or whatever it currently is  is too much slowly  over time  to prevent shocks from the deleveraging   deleverage the banks  and it would make it harder for a crisis to become systemic,1
80565,kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying,1
80566,kashkari was part of the paulson team that leveraged the american banking empire into toobigtofail and now that that leverage is proving to be dangerous for the survival of the one per cent kleptocrats he wants to break up the tbtf banks  geithner knew this would manifest when he used tbtf as a stopgap measure to save the synagogue of satan worshiping kleptocracy of fraudsters that run the federal reserve now that same kleptocracy wants to be bailed out once again because geithner s temporary solution has run it s course straight into the gutter where geithner amp  kashkari et al  belong  up yours  america the functional retard,
80568,dude that deserve to be hung in the public square by their genitalia and beaten like a pinyata by roidedup baseball player,
80570, every  prepackaged shredded cheese has it it s the most common anticlumping agent used around the world the argument is that the labels said 100  cheese,9
80571,labels should be accurate end of story if the product inside does not match the label ingredients  it is fraud and should be prosecuted as such,8
80572,that s why you buy a little wedge of parm and use a microplane grater on it to shave cheese onto your pasta the wedge lasts a very long time  and in the end it s cheaper than the nasty jars,7
80573,cellulose is the actual substance you ll find it in all pregrated cheeses these guys were just busted putting too much in to save    lettuce is also made of cellulose where commercial outfits get it for cheese  i guess could be just about any plant judged edible  including  sure  trees  also who knows what kind of cheese you re supposedly getting much nicer to get a hunk of the real stuff and a crank grater  my knuckles hate box graters with a passion ,8
80574,so my penne has wood,7
80575,so the correct labeling is 92  cheese and 8  wood filler  i think that s right,6
80576,solution  buy your parmesan  domestic or real  and grate it yourself tastes better too if you re really lazy  grate it and freeze until you need it,7
80577,damn were becoming like china  next will have faked food,6
80578,what kind of wood   are we talking the high quality organic stuff  or factory processed scrap wood  because goddamnit if they ve been slipping cheap wood shavings into my welfarecheese  we re going to have an fucking issue on our hands,4
80579,lol  wood it is cellulose trying to get clicks,6
80580,i m safe  source  only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti,3
80581,i shred my own parmesan cheese  it makes worlds differenc,3
80582,this is why i do nt buy nasty sargento cheese ever taste it  it tastes like wood  i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better,3
80583,hmm i am pretty sure i misread that title,1
80584,it s cheaper by the chunk anyways,1
80585,similar to olive oil  most parmesan cheese is nt even parmesan cheese,1
80586,my parents always called it cardboard chees,1
80587,it still taste oh so goooooooood,1
80588,if it tastes good  i do nt care,1
80589,pene means weiner in spanish that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood,1
80590,maybe they are just trying to get people to eat a whole door over the course of a year,1
80591,just buy the blockwedge and grate your own,1
80592,gt  she faces up to a year in prison  so  what re you in for blondie    just beat me up and get it over with,1
80593,cellulose is indeed an anti clumping agent if they use more and it does not change taste  i am ok with it at least it has less calories  ,
80594,if you buy preshredded or grated cheese  you deserve to eat wood,
80596,so not only are these disputed  there are now long term  long range weapons on them,1
80598,it s what twitter has always been  a megahorn for loudmouths and self important egotists,6
80599,i m always shocked that people take any type of social media seriously  it s twitter  it s mostly fucking garbage opinions and stupid nonsense,6
80600,shame the guy is a national treasure and to be respected he makes a crack at someone  and suddenly he is a sexist pig  i expect this nonsense from uni students in the states  but not europe did nt realize tumblr reaches so far,7
80601,but he s right she s dressed like a bag lady,6
80602,twitter has basically turned into a more sophisticated version of worldstarhiphop i feel like the only people on twitter are bots  black people  tumblr queens and the occasional elitist liberal  it s liberal eating liberals who are nt eating bashing conservatives enough,6
80603,itt  pretentious neckbeard,1
80604,who is steven fry  is he related to phillip j fry,
80606,funny how employers get to steal from employees  and if they are caught  they simply have to repay the employee what they are owed nobody gets charged  nobody goes to jail  meanwhile  if an employee steals from an employer  they get charged  fined  and probably spend some time in jail ditto for customers who steal  i wonder why people hate the government and rich people,8
80607,hopefully australia has a similar thing to the usa where prisoners are paid like 47 cents per day,6
80608,not as bad as actual slaves that work in unpaid internships,5
80609,well  when the tpp goes through we ll all get to enjoy such working conditions  the fact of the matter is that this occurs constantly  the authorities refuse to investigate and the workers lack the leverage to bring the employers to court,1
80610,here in the us the government would go after ahmed and not see an issue with what was going on monetarily  edit  some of you really need to step away from the computer and not take this place so seriously,
80611,seriously why are we  the usa  importing workers on visas to work at 711s,
80614,the county commissioner who spearheaded the public sales tax for the bengals and reds stadia now works for the bengals,9
80615,let the  14 dollar beer flow,8
80616,corruption of public officials in michigan  no way,9
80617,i certainly do nt necessarily agree with public funds being used for a sports stadium  and i definitely do nt agree with nepotism  but i think criticizing mike illitch somehow taking advantage of detroit is a shortsighted mistake had it not been for mr illitch pretty much singlehandily reinvesting in a city everyone wanted to leave behind over the last 20 years  the city would nt even be close to back on a path to relevancy  whether you want to believe it is or not   the other thing to consider is that this new complex not only brings commerce to an area that was a combination of blight and open fields  it also brings quite a few jobs to the city  as well as some stateoftheart buildings that will bring commerce and international travelers to the area for a variety of reasons  conferences  concerts  etc   this all equals more money for the city of detroit  which is why they re willing to make the investment in the first place   and another part of a blightfilled neighborhood updated and usable for the future  this is a sticky situation that reeks of an unfortunate quidproquo  but when it comes to what is good for the city of detroit  it s hard to argue that anyone has anything on the passion and dedication of mike illitch,9
80618,how in the fuck are there no comments about the red wings owner s hair  ,9
80619,everyone talks about the insanity in pro sports these days  yet no one mentions  public or private  universities  which are all nonprofit  spending massive amounts of their cash on stadiums  athletic facilities  etc it s the same thing if the universities are public  and its only marginally different if they re private the reason they have that money in the first place is federallysubsidized student loans,8
80620,lol illitch has done more for the city of detroit than any other person in the last 50 years fuck off,9
80621,so he did a good job for the team and the owner offered him more money for a better job  happens all the time  kids,6
80622,is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit  or ford field  most people would not step foot downtown if it was nt for those two places i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do nt bring forth revitalization like intendedbut the only article i ve read was about stadiums in la and sf,6
80623,before you jump on the  why ca nt detroit use the money for things that actually matter  train   here s   http  wwwcrainsdetroitcomarticle20140921news309219990oncostfinancingofwingsarenahereareanswers  an article outlining the finances of this massive project  edit  s  for those not wanting to click  gt  the initial base price is  450 million problems  changes and added amenities could increase that final cost anything beyond  450 million must be paid by the ilitches  gt  the michigan strategic fund will sell  450 million in two series of bonds they will be divided into  250 million in series a bonds that will be backed by property taxes already captured by the downtown development authority the  200 million in series b bonds will be backed by the  115 million olympia development has agreed to pay the dda for bond retirement  gt  the ilitches  through olympia  will pay  200 million of the bond debt detroit s dda  via its property tax capture ability  will pay back  250 million of the bonds new yorkbased merrill lynch  a division of bank of america  which has pledged to buy all the publicly backed series a bonds in the deal it will then sell the bonds to the public dallasbased comerica bank inc will buy the series b bonds backed by olympia s money the bank  formerly based in detroit  has the naming rights to comerica park  where the ilitchowned detroit tigers play comerica intends to keep the bonds on its books rather then sell them,8
80624, misleading title   https  wwwredditcomrhockeycomments45xs0mdetroit_contractor_who_negotiated_285_million_ind00vnke   it was state money  not detroit s also  ilitch footed most of the bill himself  or through his company   please research  the district  and see their plans for it before passing judgement,9
80625,clickbait no one around here is remotely upset about taxpayer funds going to a new stadium for the most popular team in town we re not really unhappy about the new development for business and residences that is happening and we re not raising any concerns about the effort to revitalize the city  detroit is climbing out of a hole created by the corruption of influential individuals local business and leaders have been more beneficial in this process than any other group and this stadium  and the district surrounding it are seen as victories in this effort,8
80626,ah  a local spin on the old  congressperson becomes lobbyist  setup,5
80627,they are literally building new district for the city not just an arena  a whole new district development is what the city needs and frankly  detroit politics have always been just a  wee  bit corrup,4
80628,but  guys  come on we need our circuses  what would we do with out national sports  concentrate on real issues  lol  that s no fun ,4
80629,at ohio state  the man whole negotiated the deal to sell its parking rights to a private company  campusparc  left to work for them after it was signed,4
80630,you think that s a wig,4
80631,public money should never be allowed to pay for sports teams unless the team has to pay back the city directly  with interest none of this but businesses will benefit  bullsht it s my fucking money you re stealing  i do nt want to  potentially  subsidize businesses downtown,8
80632,if you re a bernie supporter  who thinks a public funded  1 trillion dollar infrastructure package is a good deal because jobs  but is outraged by the state of michigan investing  285 million in the renovationrevitalization of its  largest city  then you might want to reexamine one of those positions,6
80633,for all the people complaining about spending the money on the new stadium and  less mentioned  surrounding developments  all i can say is it will be more than worth it if it fixes up that area governments of all levels have been dumping money into the cass corridor since the early days of johnson s great society programs with any luck this will finally be a solution that stick,7
80634,itt  out of staters have no fucking idea about the current state of economics in detroit and how great this project is going to be for the city  i do nt even know where to begin with this article it s clear the author did nt talk to a single person in the city or state or even try to get a feel for the public opinion on the topic including garbage clickbait phrases like the previous article titled  detroit scam city  how the red wings took hockeytown for all it had  has to be one of the dumbest fucking things i ve ever read  when detroit was at its absolute rock bottom worst  going to joe louis arena was probably the only reason suburban white people would ever go into the city and spend money now mike ilitch wants to build a gigantic urban development project including restaurants  shopping stores    apartment complexes   and oh yeah a brand new stateoftheart arena for one of the most successful hockey teams of all time  they have nt missed the playoffs since before i was born  25 years ago they are a big deal and have been for decades   oh  and it s being built at the exact time there s an influx of young people and new businesses into the the city which will create more upward momentum  yes  the city is helping pay for it the city also got a lot of input on it design  layout  and what additional projects would be built along with the arena this happens in every single city an arenastadium is built i do nt necessarily think that s how it should work but the fact of the matter is that this is how these deals are made and the city absolutely needs projects like this if it wants to continue on its upward trend  also attacks on mike ilitch in this article and this thread are disgusting illitch has been a controversial figure for a long time but his story is like example of the american dream you d see in fiction his parents were poor immigrants  he grew up in detroit joined the marines played minor league baseball for the team he now owns opens up a mom and pop pizza place and creates an empire out of it  gets rich while creating jobs and doing public works projects for the city he grew up in even though it s a complete shit hole mike ilitch has been spending  and yes  making  money in detroit for years mike ilitch was there in the 90 s and early 00 s before there was ever a housing crash in the rest of the country the man is nt a saint but if it were nt for him there would be a lot less charities and projects being invested in now he wants to build a project the city desperately needs with the city s help and input  and he s getting shit on by some dumb ass  journalist  that ca nt get their facts straight  endran,7
80635,someone call charlie leduff,5
80636,good old cronyism at its finest  nothing new to detroit at all,5
80637,i wonder if journalists really think this is breaking news,3
80638,where is my surprise face,3
80639,a city official operating at a congressional level,3
80640,gt  detroit contractor who negotiated  285 million in public money for the red wings now works with red wings owner so  i love how these headlines are supposed to make us feel outraged,4
80641,same shit happened here in richardson  texas  a suburb of dallas   the mayor brought in a huge company to the city and then left office to get a job with that same company it also turns out she was having an affair with a guy from that company too,3
80642,stop giving public money let business deal with business  not government  which can only be scammed and lead to corruption and bloated monopolies promote free market  and separation of power,3
80643,to be fair  he was working with him then too,1
80644,i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him,1
80645,conflict of interests everywhere,1
80646,this is how it worksthere is nt anything new to this story that is nt happening in nearly every major city and state across the country  i do nt like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it,1
80647,public money  om,1
80648,wow  you mean so someone who worked very closely with an organization and built relationships decided to work for said company later on in their career  shocking  i tell you,1
80649,everyone from the owners to the safety and comfort of the city and everyone thinks this whole plan is going to a country that did not mainly speak my language  i would learn it,1
80650,what a shocking surprise,1
80651,well that s convenien,1
80652,in other news  bears do  it turns out  shit in the woods,1
80653,can we just start an embarrass the fuck out of these greedy punks campaign,1
80656,thats bad news for all the 711 in our town that take the,8
80657,does nt this just translate into fewer places for poor people to buy food,7
80658, 711 cashiers will now have to ring up cigarettes as organic kale instead of hot pockets,7
80659,on the other hand  if the business stops taking food stamps entirely  not only can they not get the kale you want to make them eat  but they also ca nt get a loaf of bread or gallon of milk unless they start selling their food stamps to get cash to buy the milk and bread so the business still makes their money  the amount of food stamp fraud goes up  and the poor that you claim to be helping are getting even less food  healthy or otherwise  because of the food stampcash exchange rate,4
80660,why are nt food stamps like wic  with wic you get vouchers for specific food items these items cover the basic food groups and align with a certain amount of nutritional value  meanwhile  you can buy friggin monster energy drinks with food stamps that makes no sense  regardless if you are looking at it from a healthy standpoint or a taxpayer standpoint,6
80661,if obesity and other nutrition related issues are such a problem among the poor  would nt it be more cost effective to do away with food stamps and implement something like a food box program instead  in other words would the cost of labor to package and ship prepared food boxes in bulk to grocery stores and distribution centers be offset by what would be saved in reduced healthcare costs  imagine a program where you list the people in your household  any allergies or specific requirements and a box is prepared to supplement your family for a week it could contain things like rice  beans  canned or pouched goods like meats  vegetables and fruits  dried oatmeal and cereals  powdered milk  cooking oil every month they could receive a selection of 5 spices  salt and pepper and even a recipe pamphlet if in addition to the box  they started a program where grocery stores and produce growers could drop off older or bruised produce  people could pick some up for free when they picked up their boxes,7
80662,what if the healthy foods do nt sell  are they still forced to stock them  would nt you think the actual grocers in the neighborhood would have a better sense of what their customers want than the federal government,4
80663,no they ll stop or pack up and leave  ahhhincentives,5
80664,you can lead them to water  but you ca nt make them drin,5
80665,we have jackinthebox here in phoenix that has we accept ebt  signs up all over pisses me off  same thing at the gas station when you see children without any parents around loading up on overpriced candy and soda and  sure enough  out comes the ebt card or even worse is when they are  with  the adult and loading up on dog shit  food stamps should only be foractual food,1
80666,honestly this will be great  the state  should  be very involved in what people eat for free,1
80667,another  good intention  bad policy,1
80668,this is the dark side of welfare  the constitution is completely circumvented the government has the power to cajole and pressure when it is putting stipulations on the money it gave out the government is capable of doing things it would never have the power of doing otherwise  like forcing a business to carry certain products  or forcing a person to apply for jobs or eventually  forcing people to work at government labor jobs,1
80669,because dontravious demands fresh cilantro,3
80670,i wonder how much crime in a store would go down if the store was no longer food stamp approved,1
80672,gt  purchase orders showing that the sheriff s office spent more than  60000 on barbecue grills wtf why,9
80673,this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties the docs and comments on the forum board are searing i would imagine many itinformation systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments,8
80674,i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever,8
80675,cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification  one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry,5
80676,they re public officials and public servants  appointedhiredelected we re entitled to see what these records are  without exception,8
80677,as much as i m for police transparency  i m not for their home addresses being out there that puts their families and neighbors at risk,8
80678,i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered,8
80679,anything worth even looking at in this release,3
80680,do nt know why they re concerned  surely they have nothing to hide ,5
80681,if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear,1
80682,good anytime somebody s falsely charged with shit their life is dragged through the mud in the papers  let the pigs have the same,
80683,you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings,1
80684,notice that hackers never dox the 01   billionaires sponsoring hillary clinton  etc,1
80685,you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced  well fuck it no more police and no more rules    fucking stupid juveniles,
80686,umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops there s hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops,
80689,the more information like this surfaces  the less skeptical i am about rumors that companies plan to  chip  employees,1
80691,they need stricter gun control,1
80694,well shit i just read a til like last week about him still being alive,1

80740,bison burgers bison steaks bison roasts  yum,8
80741,the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison,5
80742,are they only being killed for food  that s slaughter  if they are being killed for management purposes  that s called culling,7
80743,it s population control  hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use,6

80758,from the daily caller article  gt   i believe this was a hate crime and i was targeted because of my skin color   marquez told the dcnf  too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the main stream media refuses to report on it  woah there racist  only black people can be the victim of a hate crime  now take your beating and shut the hell up about these underprivileged disadvantaged teen youths,8
80759,i m sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case,8
80760,lock these shitheads up and throw away the ke,8
80761,black lives do matter these teens  lives  however do not,9
80762,every fucking time a cop shoots a black guy  justified or not  we have people like obama telling us we have to do some  soul searching  and when cities like dc and baltimore  i live around both and can personally attest that shit like this happens all the time and is usually never reported  and detroit and new york and such have this shit happen  it s a non issue  fuck all of it  trump 201,8
80763,do white lives matter to blacks,6
80764,i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold  it s really political blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims  and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws  and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm  how much power do the sjws really have  will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution,8
80765,and people try to tell me that what celebrities do and say is not important at all on some level  in some instances it is  this is the movement beyonc  tried to shove into everyone s face at the superbowl just remember that,8
80766,best optionavoid dc because it s a shit hole,7
80767, across the street from the fbi headquarters,6
80768, do black lives matter if you do nt agree we ll beat and rob you   and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement,8
80769,i would like to remind everyone that bernie sanders has aligned himself with and defended the black lives matter movement in many of his speeches he talks about sandra bland  michael brown  eric garner and in typical fashion blames racism and the white establishment sanders never once mentions the blacks that are home invading in indianapolis  kansas city  atlanta  etc he never once talks about the blacks that have shot at and killed police  most recently a 19 year old black man shoots an officer in mississippi black lives matter and politicians like sanders are waging that the future will be less white and in that future you folks can imagine who will be the most vile and racist  edit  from today  white house tweets shoutout to grammy winner of best rap album  still no word on recent spate of cop killing,9
80770,let s see if this gets labeled as the hate crime it very clearly is  who am i kidding  that wo nt happen,8
80771,i do not think that black lives matter more than anyone elses if anyone else does  they do nt understand what equality is fuck blm,8
80772,i need to start carrying my gun more often i have my ccw  but rarely do i carry because i dont see the need i just acquired it because its my right to have one,7
80773,what s weird this is nt a bad part of dc at all given  any mcdonald s you go to in this city is likely to be crawling with some of the world s worst  but still,6
80774,yeah beating a man and robbing him is a surefire way to get your point across right,6
80775,black lives matter is to racial equality what isis is to islam both these groups attract those who wish to have power over others  not to enlighten others i hold both in low esteem,7
80776,the sooner they get recognized as the terrorists that they are  the sooner they can be dealt with with boots in their necks,8
80777,do black lives matter or do all lives matter,7
80778,black lives matter  to who,8
80781,interesting though   since 2005  texas has prosecuted 38 juveniles for intoxication manslaughter or intoxication assault only three were sent to the adult system  and half of all cases resulted in probation of some kind  i think this is more telling of the justice system  and accessibility to competent  quality counsel it s clear money buys better legal counsel  but if the government subsidized public defense more heavily  the outcomes would clearly be different,9
80782,cash is king in the world of corruption,9
80783,i said this somwhere else  but it s also pertinent here  everyone is equal under the law and money is how we measure that equality,9
80784,the difference  money,9
80785,it s almost like the rich live under different rules,8
80786,this is standard practice in the us judicial system outcomes will vary from case to case depending on financial status there s actually a legal term for it  it s called   cream ,9
80787,my mom has always said guilty until proven rich,8
80788,i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law this is the american dream,8
80789,and liberty and justice for all  who can afford it ,5
80790,i love how this article just glosses over the fact that arellano had previous dui convictions which is why he did nt receive the same sentence  this was couch s first dui case which is why he got probation  as texas takes the rehab route  but whatever lets rage and ignore the fact,8
80791,is everyone here honestly  seriously shocked that money gets you out of trouble  am i taking crazy pills,5
80792,going beyond the dae legal system is corrupt  circlejerk in this thread  there are certainly some differences in these cases firstly  the arellano case  the other one in the article  happened in 2007  six years before couch s trial likewise  the article says that arellano had driven while intoxicated and drank underage before  which means that he would ve had a greater chance of being moved to an adult trial meanwhile  couch had no prior violations of the law  meaning that he could nt be moved to an adult court,6
80793,i understand what you are trying to do with your anecdotal case comparisons however  they are nt comparable cases when you consider all the factors  including criminal history  but  even if you ignore all the other factors  i know of a white 20 yo male from a fairly wealthy family in my area who was sent to prison for a year based on a drunk driving accident so my anecdotal evidence shows similar punishment to your anecdotal case thereby anecdotally refuting your point,8
80794,the real crime here those eyebrow,6
80795,gee  it s almost like different judges and prosecutors in different areas with separate cases can lead to different verdicts or something,6
80796,that s why the case became famous because he got away while guilty that was autocorrect capitalization,4
80797,affluenza is just a fake term that means the following  if you are rich  you do nt go to jail if you are not  you will spend 10 years like 95  of americans,4
80798,let s be clear what happened to the poor kid was what s supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone you fucking go to prison couch was the exception,7
80799,he did nt go free he was on probation and then he violated that  so he s going to jail,8
80800,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,3
80801,if someone is brought up too rich to not know the difference between right and wrong  why can the same argument not be used for poor people who commit crimes  people who are brought up in poverty do nt really know right from wrong just as much as a kid who has rich parents,3
80802,that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time,3
80803,  sees title   probably not a rich white kid   clicks article   and yuuuuuuuuuup sm,3
80804,prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win,3
80805,obviously as white god intended,4
80806,i fucking hate ethan couch  i mean look at that look on his face disgusting i mean even his name is stupid,5
80807,horrible headline  38 cases of dui manslaughter in texas since 2005 and only 3 of them went to adult court  that tells you the vast majority of these cases are handled with kid glovesso picking out one of 3 that went the other route and comparing it to the affluenza case is disingenuous  but fuck it  that is what the media does today god forbid they instead do an article focusing on how in texas if you are a drunk driving kid that kills people you will get away with it 35 out of 38 time,4
80808,it did nt seem to mention how they had the same judge  we ve already established this same judge would have been open to giving a similar sentence to a poor minority because she tried to do just that keep making this a race issue  though lord knows the media loves to stir up ignorant poor folks  also  anyone who comes to the us illegally and kills is citizens deserves little sympathy he was a juvenile  so it would be appropriate to release him and deport him  i do nt understand the need to distort issues to make tbem about race we already have enough problems it s already an established fact that those with the means to afford a lawyer fair better than those who do nt,3
80809,the difference  money,1
80810,did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window,1
80811,by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time,1
80812,excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did,1
80813,law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening,1
80814,lemmeguess ethnic  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they re ethnic,1
80815,cash rules everything around me they have  and very good lawyers,1
80816,well  on one hand you have a kid that killed 3 adults and a child in a crash  and on the other a kid who killed a mother and her  unborn child  in a crash in a conservative state so he could have mowed down 10 born people and probably got less than what he gets for  accidentally  killing 1 unborn baby,1
80817,free public defender vs 2000  an hour lawyer,1
80818,this affluenza thing still baffles me  doing bad things because money  with that sort of logic hobos must be saints and not the crack heads living under bridges,1
80819,no shit  i mean was nt the entire outrage that similar cases normally lead to prison in the first place,1
80820,seriously  the rich kid,1
80821,that s what  affluenza  means literally the entire point of this case and why it s been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich,1
80822,i say it like my grandma used to  money talks  bullshit walks,1
80823,he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows wtf,1
80824,there s actually a legal question that you asked,1
80825,you do nt automatically get a dui in fact,1
80826,biggest problem in the universe  vote it up  http  thebiggestproblemintheuniversecomepisode8,1
80829,for those of you incapable of rtfa before making racist comments  the bride and groom are actors hired by a charity to raise awareness and the 37000day statistic refers to child marriages estimated worldwide not specifically in this local area,9
80830,gt  nearly 15 million girls  some as young as eight or nine so  some as young as eight,9
80831,37000 child marriages every day  if that s the case why are these people shocked  surely they must see these pedo photoshoots on the reg,9
80832,these statistics seem unreliable estimated 12 billion new child marriages by 2050  even taking the 37000 a day estimate at face value that would only get you to 500 million by 2050  i mean seriously  assuming population growth rates remain unchanged  unlikely as the rate is slowing significantly  there will only be  47 billion women born under the age of 8 by 2050 is it truly believable that a quarter of women born in the next 34 years are going to be placed into a child marriage,8
80833,ok this is a serious issue  but fuck the misleading clickbait title,8
80834,paid to act and still goes for the hoverhand,4
80835,as young as nine nine years old damn,4
80836,i doubt half the people even read the article and thought the video was real they were actors and were stopped by plenty of people who called them criminals,6
80837,i just wanted to point out the hand hove,1
80838,where in lebanon was this  looks a bit like beirut if so  i can understand the mixed reactions i would wager the reactions would be less mixed in the northern or southern regions,1
80839,i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country it s picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual some of them just do nt realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do,1
80840,eh personally i m more concerned with men sitting with their legs spread on public transportation that s the real problem,1
80841,at that rate the entire female population of the us would be married off in 11 years certainly 37000 child marriages a day is unsustainable or maybe it s media hype,1
80842,the religion of peaceand pedophiliaand rapeand beheadingsand suicide bombingsand mass executions,
80843,pakistan tried to pass a law banning child marriages and the clerics said   nope  the koran says as soon as a girl menstruates  she can be dtf whoever she s married to  so you re not allowed to pass a law like that  so they took it back and child marriage continues to be legal,
80844,woody allen is dating again,1
80845,what wrong with this prophet mohammad had sex with a nine year old child  prophet is perfect do nt be blinded by secularism  thats what an apologist would say and its true the prophet liked them youn,
80846,ignorant people get morals from a stupid book that is nt mora,
80847,no one cares it s over ther,
80848,these clickbait titles are getting out of hand,
80849,are these the people you want flooding your country on a daily basis  are these the kinds of values that america will benefit from importing,
80850,lol this is nt normal in lebanon and that is clear from the video these people are actor,
80851,its funny how the muslims in the video oppose this even though the greatest man that has ever lived  mohammed  has actually married a child around that age,
80852,honestly what s the big deal this is a tradition going back thousands of years why stop it now,
80853,someone post this on rfeminism and see where that fuse leads too i would but i been banned for positing stuff that does nt fit the narrativ,
80854,i thought this was child to child marriage   still fucked up but at least that s not as bad as this,
80855,once a girl has her period  nature has decided she can be a parent or a bride that s a hard fact for most to swallow nature gives no shits about how our culture has changed,
80857,idiot drinks and drives and shares it with people over some app idiot gets arrested for drinking and driving it is the idiots first time offense and the idiot gets sentenced to standard punishment for a first time offense nothing to see here,9
80858,is that typical for a first time offense in florida,8
80859,12 months of probation plus losing your license is pretty standard,6
80860,i mean  many states and counties do nt do mandatory jail time for first time duis,8
80861,heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off fre,8
80862,her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui,8
80863,most people do nt go to jail for first time dui the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though,5
80864,10 day vehicle impound  that is just a rich vs poor sorter  the poor people cant pay for ten days of impound at  80night right away  so every day they wait to pay its another  80 then they lose their car,6
80865,calls for help  cries for attention  are getting pretty extreme these days  next i m expecting someone to periscope a skydiving jump   i m not going to pull the chute unless i get 100 facebook likes ,3
80866,reddit   there are too many people in prison     person is treated with leniency   reddit   kill her   look  the point of prison is to rehabilitate  keep society safe  or punish maybe this lady was given a hefty amount of probation  something i often ask for because you always have time to throw someone away and put them in prison  but they do nt get that time back  so they ll lose their jobs  houses  children  etc how exactly does society benefit from that   maybe she has a lot of factors that call for mitigation,5
80867,it was nt flordia man it was flordia woman,6
80868,as a 40 year old  are the younger people with smart phones really this fucking stupid  i have a smart phone  and the last freaking thing i do is broadcast every life choice i make what ever happened to  if no one knows  i wo nt get caught  i can remember going to parties in the early 2000 s when digital cameras were getting popular and i would shy away from them while drunk saw lots of compromising photos that did not tell the full story now we are at a point that people are broadcasting this shit live holly hell,3
80869,premeditated drinking and driving is that a thing because she admitted to i,3
80870,very happy she did nt hurt anyone  or herself,1
80871,like it or not  this is pretty standard for 1st time dwi offenses especially since there was nt a wreck or damage to property,1
80872,this is great pr for periscop,1
80873,driving drunk is not easy,1
80874,what is 10 day weekend work release,1
80875,at first i thought this was a reasonable charge  but when i read the article it said that she was actually driving with a flat tire most drunks are smart enough to avoid driving on a flat  this woman is an idiot and deserves a harsh punishment she was intoxicated enough to seriously endanger the lives of others  if an officer had nt pulled her over i m sure she would have caused some serious damage,
80876,that s cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work releas,
80877,well it s not like you can prove that she was actually intoxicated  so the fact that she was nt punished seems appropriate,
80878,and my mom wonders why i m not married,
80881,also cars bad guys use those a lot and the internet also food,9
80882,casinos would lobby against it a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small it would fit in a plastic shopping bag a million dollars in small bills is massive  there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash,8
80883,how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 ,9
80884,yeah if my big illegal bag of money was heavier  i d totally reconsider all the crime i do to obtain large bags of money it just would nt be worth the hassle,7
80885,thank you but fuck no it s bad enough carrying around 100s to go buy cars amp  bikes on craigslist  now you want me to carry boxes of 20s   the  100 has plenty of legitimate uses  no need to make things harder for the 999  of the population that s lawabiding,9
80886,thats why they got rid of the  500 billand it didnt work so well,8
80887,keep marijuana and cocaine illegal  it s the 100 dollar bills that are the problem,7
80888,i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four  5000 bills instead of two  10000 was too taxing better go straight,8
80889,clearly  100 bills are the problem,7
80890,people still listen to larry summers  i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008 or does cnn still think repealing glasssteagall was a good idea,7
80891,it s not about stopping criminals it s about controlling peoples money with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically this is what done in europe to prevent  tax fraud ,7
80892,might aswell remove any chemicals or equipment in the world that can make drugs aswell larry summers idea is stupid  it would nt just hurt criminals  it would hurt the innocent people aswell,7
80893,in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the  100 bill it is very popular outside the us,5
80894,the new blue  100 bills are too cool to replace,5
80895,80  of the money supply being in  100 bills is the key statement this would likely be the first  and easiest  step to killing paper currency this is one of the initial hurdles to overcome  because they do nt give a fuck about it being tough on criminals  come on  when looking to implement negative interest rates,8
80896,the thing about secondary labor markets  drugs  gambling  prostitution  etc  is that prohibition is what causes the main problems related to them these are black markets that will always have demand as long as the activities are forced underground by punitive policy  and that demand will always find a way around obstacles  making life marginally more difficult for the suppliers is only doing to make the products more dangerous  not less desirable,5
80897,that is the most twisted logic   no more  100 bills  guess i ll stop dealing crack,5
80898,okay larry last time we listened to you we deregulated the banks in 1999 nah larry  i m not gon na listen to you,5
80899,make it illegal for poor people to ever have cash money so that you can freeze their accounts when their name shows up on the noflylist  eh  they already ca nt buy a car in cash without the dealership informing on them to the feds,6
80900,how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds   ,4
80901,i urge everybody here to watch inside job  it will shock you on how thoroughly corrupt this dude is  along with his buddies on wall street washington now he wants the gov to ban the  100 because of nirp  he does nt give a fuck about criminals using those or tax evasions do not listen to what this turd says,4
80902,attention  we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash  except pennies   cash is privacy and should be a basic right,1
80903,i wonder what larry would think about paul krugman s onetime pet project  the  trilliondollar coin   http  krugmanblogsnytimescom20130107bereadytomintthatcoin  _r  0 ,5
80904,is something going on with all the major currencies  i saw a similar story about the euro notes too  http  wwwdailymailcoukwiresreutersarticle3448066ecbconsidersscrapping500euronotehtml also http  wwwdailymailcouknewsarticle3437590banksurgedban50notesbidendcashhandculturehelprecoupbillionstaxtreasuryhtml all these stories within a week of each other  i would nt be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency,3
80905,currently in colorado  hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash,3
80906,scrap larry summers  and get rid of a criminal,3
80907,the only relevance to crime is the idea itself scam to grab more control of your money  bankster shenanigans do nt fall for it,3
80908,the banks love this this means less people holding cash and more money that they can use to fuck us over remember folks  the rules are changing so that the money on deposit with banks is legally not yours if there s a bank failure  your money will be used to bail out the banks  the move is simply an extension of the war on cash,3
80909,the fed stopped printing any bills higher than  100 in 1945 they began destroying the larger denominations actively in 1969  100 in 1945 is equivalent to  1300 today adjusting for inflation frankly they should be talking about issuing a  200 and  500 bill  if not also a  1000 bill,3
80910,larry summers should be in prison  he is one of the architects of the 2008 collapse he also was instrumental in the repeal of glasssteagall the world would be better off without this fool and his dangerous ideas  http  wwwsourcewatchorgindexphp  title  larry_summer,3
80911,does larry mean wall st criminals  of course not  white male entitlement it s what larry is all about unfortunately obama was dumb enough to bring summers into his administration where he flailed about  lamely attempting to cover upmake excuses as to why the theater burned down in 2008 with the financial  masters of the universe  still inside  larry proved his overall dumbness by predicting 2011 would be  recovery summer   based on nothing  no evidence just his  expert  opinion  there was no recovery in 2011,3
80912,bring back the  500 and  1000 dollar bills dammit,3
80913,larry summers  ladies and gentlemen one of the masterminds of financial deregulation is now proposing another hair brained idea summers  go clone yourself so you can go fuck yourself,3
80914,just legalize crime everybody wins,3
80915,fuk this illuminati puppe,4
80916,the bulk of the value of cash in circulation is from  100 s get rid of cash and the fed can do any crazy policy it wants this is a necessary step towards negative interest rates nobody believes the government gives two shits about money laundering  florida real estate laws and hsbc getting zero criminal charges shows that is not the case,3
80917,banksters do nt even use cash oh wait you re talking about the little criminals carry on,4
80918,another attempt by the wealthy to outlaw cash our money is nt our money  according to the elite,5
80919,then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination ,3
80920,scrap the two  the single  the penny  half dollar and nickel instead,3
80921,scrap the drugs too  make them illegal  oh wait,1
80922,but they just click buttons on a computer and create and move money around  wait  what,1
80923,than how will our government and cia function,1
80924,interning theory main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks,1
80925,singapore has had the 10000 singapore dollar bill for some time it is still legal tender  but is going to be phased out slowly old notes will not be replaced  this is a calculated strategy by the sg government to comply with international counterterrorism and anti money laundering efforts  but minimising their own vulnerability to regulatory arbitrage,1
80926,is nt the  100 bill the staple of american foreign trade  i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like  interestfree  loans  though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ,1
80927,politicians do nt use  100s so how could it harm criminals,1
80928,what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then,1
80929,gt  the  100 bill is actually the second most common us bill in circulation  behind the  1 bill  gt  nearly 80  of the  14 trillion of us currency in circulation is in  100 bills much of it is held outside the united states  i m no math magician  but this does nt seem to fit,1
80930,yeah  just watch  they will scrap it right down to the 20  anyone who wants to make largeish purchases will have to use electronic accounts that can be tracked  oh yeah   because crime  not  because government needs to track your every move,1
80931,this is one of those ideas that seems silly at first but the more you think of it  the more it makes some sense,1
80932,this is stupid  criminals will make due with what ever currency there is  they do nt fucking care and any one who thinks otherwise is a desk jocky looking for something to do,1
80933,switch to all coins while you re at it if  100 weighed an ounce   1600 would weigh a pound  1 mil would weigh 625 lbs,1
80934,larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone,1
80935,how would this effect the bitcoin market,1
80936,this is about getting rid of cash  not making life tougher for criminals that way  when the fed institutes negative interest rates  you the lowly consumer will be forced to spend your savings to avoid being charged for saving,1
80937,funny thing  today also the eu central bank ceo emanuele prodi announced that 500 euro bills are to be outphased for the same reason apparently american criminals manage to launder money with a bill that s 6 times less in value  is nt this just a global banking scheme to rob us the power over our own money,1
80938,yes those evil people in government would love to get rid of cash and make everyone just use electronic money because then  the bank has your money and you only have an iou which they may  or may not  pay you back in the future  look at cyprus in 2013 where people did nt get their full deposited funds back because of the financial crisis  also they can charge you negative interest rateswhich means you have to pay for the bank to hold your funds  and of course if the govt has your money  then they have a great deal more power over you in deciding whether they should be nice and give it back to you or not  this is another reason why bitcoin is good  although they will ban that long before they ban cash,1

80940,hmm sounds like portable bitcoin exchange devices would be cool carry a bitcoin wallet in a little  5 raspberry pilike thing with an lcd display  hook it up to another  punch in transfer codes  both devices show  are you sure   both people hit yes  see the verification displayed  and bill sizes become irrelevant and everybody can keep negotiating with cash when buying motorcycles off craigslist no matter what these control freak asshats try to pull,
80941,you can still buy silver and gold anonymously  and cash out up to  1500 worth at one time with no tax penalty,
80942,but  but  how will weezy and drizzy write raps now if they ca nt talk about dem big faces,
80945,he ll probably need something to help him sleep tonight,5
80946,gt  the judge who refused to dismiss the case this month has denied cosby s appeal of that decision  so is that like asking your parents if they are really really sure that you are grounded,4
80947,good  the prosecution seems to have a solid basis for a case this is one that should definitely go to trial the defense is going to have a tough time with all the press coverage cosby s been getting over these allegations,1
80948,kanye tweeted cosby is innocen,1
80951,that article is really light on details  does anyone know why this happened  did the guy not respond to a court summons or something along those lines  is nt a default the judgement the usual result in that situation,9
80952,this happened in feb  2003 in minnesota as well  article   http  wwwmndailycom20030214usmarshalsarreststudentloandebtorstwincities,9
80953,what happens if you literally ca nt pay your loans  asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11  just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job  edit  something a lot of you do nt seem to realize is that these were private loans there s no forgiveness with those,9
80954,not really too much context given here  so it s hard to guess at the actual situation  but federal student loans  at least direct loans and the majority of those older loans passed back to fsa as they phased out the guarantee programs  do nt get sold to private collection agencies at this time maybe that part happened a while back  before current policies went into place and the collectors are taking advantage of the protections that federallyoriginated loans have  anyway  for people who are interested in learning more about how defaulted federal student loans are being collected today   check this out   https  wwwfbogovindex  s  opportunityamp  mode  formamp  id  216a8418f8e71f0c9c3475946ab100f8amp  tab  coreamp  _cview  1  they re currently in the middle of contracting new private collection agencies to service defaulted loans and you can see in the rfp documents how agencies are being scored and how that ties into account assignments  basically  for those who do nt feel like running through all of it  the big emphasis for student loan collections now is getting people through affordable rehabilitation options and into incomedriven repayment plans placements look like they re going to be based about 50  on careful regulatory compliance and borrower satisfaction surveys  which would make it extremely difficult for high pressure collections tactics to work out in the long run  none of that changes this story  just thought it was interesting in light of some of the comments i ve read that indicate people believe strongarm collection tactics for student loans will always be the norm  tldr  they re at least trying to throw a friendly paint job over the horribly broken federal student loan system these days,9
80955,if you dont show up to court after you have been served this is what happens he has been ignoring collection attempts  he got served and ignored that too im not in favor of this man being arrested but you cant ignore court summons if you get served you have to go,9
80956,upconwell said it best  gt  you are reading way to much into the article no one said they were violent no one said they had their guns drawn they are us marshals  they carry guns  every god damn day   gt  they probably went to his door  knocked he answered and they said  hey  we have a warrant for you for failing to appear in a federal court   he probably said  oh shit let me get some pants  gt  no violence  no guns drawn  everything was pretty standard and nonviolent  gt  plus  it should be noted that he was not arrested for failing to pay student loans  he was arrested for violating a court order,9
80957,how do you not pay a  1500 loan after 30 friggin years,9
80958,gt  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  this almost reads like satire,9
80959,i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors,9
80960,where in this article did it say  guns drawn  as most people are stating here  it says  with guns   every on duty us marshal goes through their day  with guns   someone signed a contract for a loan  and then spends almost three decades not paying it i agree that a police force should nt have been used there are financial measures that can be taken upon default of a loan rather than criminal  but i m really surprised by the circle jerk that s happening over a fox news article,9
80961,can i get a misleading title please,8
80962,you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day,6
80963,lol  you guys are so gullible the guy dodged this debt and refused to engage the proper authorities for 25 years this is nt a new college graduate that missed one payment then you have the cascade of predictable posts stating  boot lickers    debtors prison  and how in 30 years this will be the watershed moment we all look back to as we are enslaved by the government this is a statement case the feds took an extreme example and made an extreme example of this putz the goal of this action is compliance and to get folks to not ignore their obligations the money spent on this will scare the other million folks that are past due to actually pick up the phone and engage them to resolve the debt no one held a gun to this guy s head to sign up for the student loans and no one was stopping him for 25 years from making a payment plan for the remaining  1500 this guy deserved it and as a tax payer this is ok by me,9
80964,real story here dude was sued by the united state of america  he refused to appear  a default judgment was issued against him  he refused to appear for postjudgment depositions  judge issued an order directing him to appear in court  he ignored it and then the judge issued an arrest warrantincareration order and federal judges use us marshalls to enforce their orders  so he was nt arrested for having old student loans he was arrested for refusing to comply with a direct order from the judge  http  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386htm,8
80965,that dude could not come up with  1500 in 29 years,8
80966, a few years ago congress allowed the private sector to contract for student loan collections and so you have these private companies who are doing this  i find this scary  even though i have no student loans to pay off they dragged this dude to court and made him sign an agreement in front of their private attorney he had no attorney present  and was nt read any rights  edit  quote is from the video,9
80967,forever grateful i graduated with minimal student loans ca nt ignore bills for 25 years though  regardless of what those payments stem from from reading through the comments here  it seems like incomebased payment option is the smartest option,6
80968,i wish my student loan balance was  1500,6
80969,i knew this story was light on facts turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies  source   yahoo finance   https  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386html,6
80970,gt  our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is nt the first and wo nt be the last  this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least,8
80971,he was nt arrested for not paying his loan  he was arrested for not showing up in court  and the marshals did nt storm his house guns blazing they had guns  with them   like every other cop in the entire country,7
80972,if you take money and have no plans on paying it back  it s called stealing,9
80973,right the debt collectors just bought the debt  payed the filing fees to bring the case to court  threatened the man with their now official   pay us or else  and when he did not they used their settlement to have him arrested by the marshals nope  no government officers for hire here  just good old debt collection paid and serviced through the courts,5
80974,til that most people have no understanding how the court system works  yes  civil attorneys can issue subpoenas  yes  a court can hold you in contempt if you fail to appear yes  a potential punishment for contempt is a bench warrant for your arrest  tl  dr  you can not simply ignore subpoenas you may go to jail,5
80975,writing and publishing articles like this is dangerous the author offered a sensationalist angle on the  story  while leaving out key elements of why they were there in the first place ie missing court summons this is highly unethical and paints the federal government into a larger narrative that fox has been going for basically  rallying people by emotion not logic,5
80976,this just in  there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government film at 1,5
80977,student loans were made with certain assumptions about the future of the economy  both on the part of the schools  the tuition they charge   the lenders  and the student people should be required to pay their student loans but they should be adjusted downward  edit  this guy had a loan for  1500 measly bucks and did nt make any payments in 30 years  i would like to know if he was destitute  or just decided  fuck you everyone  i want to keep my money ,8
80978,misleading title the marshals service will  arrest  you if you fail to show up for a court appearance you are not being tossed in jail  you are being hauled into court when you refused to answer a summons  from the article   paul aker says he was arrested at his home last week for a  1500 federal student loan he received in 1987  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  does anyone feel sorry for this man   1500  be serious,7
80979,if i did nt pay back a federal loan for 29 years  i d kind of expect for there to be negative effects this dude did nt pay his loan  including when he was taken to court over it and received a judgment from the court specifically telling him to pay it if you ignore a court order  you re gon na have a bad time  i mean yes  the financial aid system needs to be fixed  but they re going after people who purposely are nt paying their loans which is a surprising amount of people  given how many refund chasers there are in the world for anyone else  there are programs like deferment options  sliding payscales  and whatever else along with loan forgiveness after 20 years  it s a shitty system  but this guy s case is not going to be the one to change it because he does nt deserve to have people dying on his hill for his particular cause,7
80980,i m socialist and firmly believe that education and medical care should be paid for by federal government out of contributions that we make  however with that said  if you are contributing member of society you have to be a special kind of asshole not to repay  1500 loan over the period of 29 years no matter what was that loan used for,8
80981,why is this news,3
80982,dude got letters in his mail for months to pay and appear in court  this doesnt just come out of the blue he refused to show up to court multiple times thats a criminal offense,5
80983,the revolution will not be subsidize,5
80984,the whole student loan thing is a complete disaste,6

80986,just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to the paper really is nt worth it otherwise college is becoming a joke anyways,5
80987,every interaction i have ever had with navient  they have done everything they can to work with me  is your payment affordable  would you like a deferment  etc  i have had to take them up on that because of divorce not saying that is everyone s experience but they have nt been the loan sharks everyone else seems to act like they are just one man s experience though,5

81018,living in germany and studying  i m gon na pay 300   335   for the upcoming semester  these 335  also includes a public transportation ticket  which is in your student id  that allows me to take the train  bus  tram etc at any time as much as i like in my entire state  books are nt nearly as expensive as in the us  the most expensive book i bought last semester was 80   89    but  seriously  95  of the content for the majority of the courses are uploaded on the university s website  files and documents which you can download for free  also  the university canteen offers you decent food for a fair price  normally around 35   in the end my biggest expenses during my semester are the coffees i buy on campu,9
81019,i m from the uk and have lived in germany for 6 years now i came here with a 20000 gbp student loan for a 4 year degree in computer science  now i m about to start a masters in web science that will cost me about 1000 eur for the 2 year course  parttime and remote  i m also just about to get german citizenship  most germans are happy to speak english  i have a job here and although most of the company speak english they make i point of speaking german with me  and i with them  i m not very good at german but am slowly learning now after 5 years of being very lazy about learning the language it s a very hard language to learn  screw those articles   but in time you ll get used to it  i absolutely love speaking to locals in german and being understood by them  to me it s like being on another planet and finally being accepted by the local populus  good luck to anyone who wants to come over  it is a wise move  come and see me near koblenz,9
81020,a friends son went to college in switzerland  we are american  even though he paid additional fees as a non native  and had to travel back and forth to europe  he still paid less than kids who went to local colleges,9
81021,come gather around the fire and listen to a tale of a spooky and simple explanation of our increasing tuition rates in the us  the government started giving student loans kids take the debt  the schools get the money tuition prices increase because they can rely on the kids to get a gov loan take away student loans  then schools ca nt rely on this money  kids ca nt afford the jacked up tuitions  enrollments drop  schools are forced to cut tuition  now more affordable again it s the same problem with mortgage crisis  just a different industry,9
81022,it s almost as if germany sees the benefit of having a well educated work force that is not bogged down by insurmountable debt,9
81023,my college actually sodomizes me,9
81024,whereas here in the states  they will gladly charge you a  250semester parking fee and you will still not actually be guaranteed a space,8
81025,maybe i should go to germany,9
81026,currently living in germany  as an american student on an international internship  what this is nt telling you is that the uni system is significantly different my roommates  all in engineering or other sciences  study all day every day they have a month of exams coming up  and they usually have only one exam per year you fail that  you fail no assignments  projects  etc  just that exam  did i mention this was a fraternity  yeah  they do nt go to uni because everyone does it  like america they work  they get accepted  and they work even more it is nt for partying  it is nt for meeting your spouse or friends  it s for becoming the best you can be  which is how a university should be  good luck to the americans coming here thinking it s anything like the states enjoy the d  ner,9
81027,something like this gets posted everysingleweek without fail and then a bunch of americans start making hasty decisions to just go study in germany because it s  free   oh and it has been this way for years so it is nt a new thing  the german courses that you will have to take for at least a year to reach fluency are around  300 a month and noduolingo is absolutely not enough to get you to the level you need to study at university  the fees for applications are at  75 then an additional 15  for each university you apply to after the first it can go well into the hundreds  the bank account you have to open for your student visa has to have a frozen amount of at least approx   8500 this is nt to say it is impossible but do nt expect roses and rainbows and raining beer amp  wurst to await your easy university life in germany  also american universities except the few ivy leagues or outstanding schools  baby the absolute shit outta you you can pretty much sail smoothly your first two years while you get your core courses out of the way in germany  you jump right into it in german remember  a different language a crazy  difficult language at that the high school diploma is also not equivalent to the german one that allows you to study at a university the equivalent would be a plethora of ap courses with really good grades or a high school diploma plus two years of college with really good grades and then you re equivalent to a german high school graduate  you will also most likely not be able to transfer credits  german bureaucracy  a bitch you will have to have german knowledge when applying for your visas or someone to be a translator there with you  you may have to do a prep year for certain programs as well it is also very competitive to get into even these programs  i sound like fucking scrooge but i ve been through all of it as so have many people i met along the way  it is possible but it will take a lot of hard work and dedication and time that you wo nt regret  losing  because it may not work out perfectly you may get rejected you may not be accepted for that semester a lot of the popular programs have a cap so it s very restricted in terms of amount of students accepted  do nt expect germany to be a country that is just waiting and fiddling its thumbs for the americans to come and study in their unis for  free  and think that they re gon na make it easy for you it is anything but,9
81028,my american husband started learning german at the age of 26 a year later he was admitted to vet school here he s almost finished now we ve been paying 120 euros a semester i think he s the only foreign student to not drop out in his class though the drop out rate is high even for germans while he s happy he is debt free  the immense stress of having to learn a very hard subject in a foreign language and a foreign system  bureaucracy is insane here   have caused many panic attacks and one major case of depression and he has nt even started the huge final exam yet but at least we wo nt be  200k in debt when this is over,8
81029,the fee is actually 150500  per semester books inclusive because of librarys and because we live in 2016 and share digitaly public transport also free  you get 600  per month plus health care  if your parents arent rich  this will be checked by government  as student  and will have to pay back   half of that   in worst conditions after you finished  also  after 3 semesters you must have passed 23 of your finals at any time to get your  baf  g  money  but this will only be checked once no money for extra semesters of course,9
81030,in my opinion let them come here  let them study here and let them stay here if they want besides the fact that the ones who stay make up for the cost of education it is a great way of cultural exchange  it s always nice to have friends from different countries  so if you are coming to the area of n  rnberg just text me ,8
81031,currently living in duisburg  germany and studying at the university of duisburgessen   my choice   i grew up in the us  but my parents are from germany after graduating high school it became apparent that studying in germany was an opportunity that i could not pass up i chose my current uni because it has an international studies in engineering program which allows me to pursue a bachelors degree in computer engineering with the first year taught entirely in english   costs   the costs are definitively low the semester fee  including public transport  is below 300   my total living expenses are below 700  a month and that includes health insurance   my experience so far   keep in my mind i m still in my first semester  as others have mentioned before  the majority of students quit after the first year last year  the failure rate of an exam taken by 200 students was over 95   attending lectures is completely voluntary and there is one exam at the end of each course that makes up 100  of your final course grade no homework is given and you are very much on your own forcing yourself to focus and learn everyday can be a serious challenge  feel free to comment or pm with any questions,7
81032,many american students also come with very false expectations about what german university is like you have to be way more self organised and please do nt expect multiple choice tests,9
81033,we need to stop this immigration because when america sends its people  it sends unskilled people and we have to spend our money on them we are going to build a wall  get america to pay for it and make germany great again,9
81034,you can only offer something for free if you limit supply fewer germans go to college than us students   only 30  of germans ages 2534 have completed a tertiary education  which includes academic degrees and some but not all vocational programs that  s below the oecd average  and below the us 45  attainment rate for the same age group  http  wwwlatimescomlocaleducationcommunitylameedufreecollegeeducationingermanybutnotincalifornia20151029htmlstoryhtml edit  so now i am amused that many people are suggesting that fewer people should go to college in the us  presumably other people  not so much themselves they are smart   it seems like this would be a less popular proposal than promising free tuition,9

81056,i have spent some time among the government arab workers of these nations and i have no pity for the trials that lie ahead of them in the real world  they wielded their unearned wealth with a brash arrogance  putting themselves above other races with a disgusting assumption that they were somehow favored by god  and therefore inherently better than others in fact  it was equally distasteful for them when an american did  not  wield their racenationality with a pompous arrogance because this undermined their own claim to legitimacy  this was not some single unpleasant person i dealt with it was the overwhelming majority out of 100 citizens  there were maybe 5 people who had enough wisdom and openmindedness to question such an absurd world view  for example  on a hot day i was supervising pakistani and indian workers doing our manual labor for us  as it would have been unbecoming for an arab and an american to be doing manual labor i took some of our cold water bottles we had in our cooler and offered them to the workers  but was stopped by one of the head guys  do nt do that   he warned me shaking his head his message was clear  he did nt want the workers to get used to that treatment  i witnessed minorities berated and even physically accosted at times only americans and british were spared from the cruel racism that pervades the arab world it seeps into your daily life and if you live in it long enough you even start to internalize it ugh  i am looking forward to the cold splash of reality to wash over that region and wake many of those intolerant people up from their slumber,7

81060,have done some research in saudi echoing similar things everybody wants government jobs  but the government is trying to push private sector employment  so you end up with many saudis who do nt do anything showing up on payrolls and there s a somewhat true perception that most companies would prefer to hire foreigners  who will work harder  over citizens  not sure what the longterm solution is for the employment problems  but crashing oil revenue is definitely going to make things worse will be interesting to see if government is going to start shrinking public sector employment more heavily,5

81092,tl  dr  apple has to provide the means to extract encrypted data from the device fbi will then try to decrypt it  i assume by brute force  would would be easy for a 4digit pin   the interesting part is that the device is owned by farook s employer  the san bernardino county department of public health had they been following proper device protocol  they would already have administrator access to it  this was literally government property used for terrorism  and now unsearchable not due to the  encryption  boogeyman but their own ineptitude,7
81093,gt  the judge ruled tuesday that the cupertinobased company had to provide  reasonable technical assistance  to the government in recovering data from the iphone 5c  including bypassing the autoerase function and allowing investigators to submit an unlimited number of passwords in their attempts to unlock the phone apple has five days to respond to the court if it believes that compliance would be  unreasonably burdensome  so it sounds like the government does nt think apple can bypass it for them  just make it easier for them to brute force i bet judge s ruling will hold up  too,4
81094,i have this hunch that this is all for show and that the fbi has access through the nsa to all of this stuff why would they cancel prism  it s not like your average citizen can inspect the electronic infrastructure of this country and verify that  for example  metadata collection has stopped i think after edward snowden they sat in a room and decided to keep doing it and act like they were stopping it i would  i sound like a conspiracy theorist but i really do think the risks of terrorism are so great and siphoning data so easy that they re still doing it,1

81102,good for him  football does nt have to be a concussion prone sport it started as the american version of rugby  and evolved into the form we see today  and can just as properly evolve into something that is nt effectively a form of human sacrifice  part of how it evolved is the career of pop warner  the coach of the carlisle indian school he kept  how to put it  coaching like a lawyer  and coming up with clever ways to get an edge  that would then eb slapped down with rule changes  surely concussions justify rule changes too,7
81103,i played football for 4 years in highschool started all 4 years i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fu,3

81123,gt  one of the three men who escaped from a california jail last month had been charged with kidnapping a marijuana dispensary owner that they suspected had hidden large amounts of cash in the desert the man and his accomplices are accused of driving the dispensary owner out to the desert  torturing him and cutting off his penis  sheesh i m not carrying more than  10 in my wallet from now on  and that has nothing to do with the fact that i m broke,9
81124,this is why they get robbed all the time out here no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys,7
81125,ca nt these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us,8
81126,there s a great documentary on netflix called  high profits  about a business in breckenridge  co right before full legalization took effect  one of the big issues was exactly this only being able to do business in cash from payroll to paying city taxes they had  120k in cash they had to just walk into the front of the city building with and that was just the first month alone  some of the people that make the drops to the shops are walking out with  10k in their pockets and no security at all it s terrifying,8

81132,are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money,4
81133,this war on cash is such bullshit  people carried cash until 12 years ago and it was perfectly fine  now they are trying to restrict flying with cash  purchasing with cash  seizing cash   the only problem is that the money is due on one day  they need to have the tax office take payment on any day of the week  so it s stacked,6
81134,i wonder how negative interest rates  if implemented  would effect the marijuana business these value of the business would probably increase as they had large sums of cash on hand their credit worthiness would increase because they had something of value  cash  but they would be penalized for depositing that cash according to the recent imf working paper i wonder if they would become attractive targets for some banks to help capitalize their weak balance sheets,3

81154,since the money cant be deposited into a bank would a good option to take be converting it into precious metals such as gold  you would still need to store the gold but that could be easily done in a safety deposit however unless you know where to go  getting that much gold could raise the attention of people you dont want raised to begin with it s not like in china or india  if you show up with a briefcase of cash and walk out with a smaller case of gold  no one really cares,1

81198,because america loves her servicemen and women so she wants them to help themselve,8
81199,i have been calling the helpline everyday for 2 weeks it is a recorded message saying call back later we are busy just then general va helpline,7
81200,the problem with the va  like most other government agencies  is that there is no accountability when you ca nt fire workers who are lazy  negligent  or worthless  you end up with a disfunctional organization filled with lazy  negligent  and worthless people,7
81201,yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country,4
81202,i have a pretty easy solution  why do nt overflow suicide calls just get forwarded to the regular suicide hotline  s   sure its probably better to deal with someone specifically trained to deal with service men and women but anyone is better then a voicemail,6
81203,that vm box is gon na get overloaded quic,3
81204,pissing off trained military personnel seems like a dumb idea in the long ru,3
81205,and sanders wants to make this available for everyone it s not the money that causes this agency to be this way it s the nature of the federal government,4
81206,it is nt a secret that the va is understaffed that is the biggest issue with the va and if they had more funding for labor costs  they would be in a far better spot,1
81207,i ve been getting this for over a month the one time i did connect  the estimated wait time was 55 minutes,1
81208,started up telepsyche again trying to make some progress a pending appointment looms  and i am very much looking forward to it  until she calls me and tells me they re cancelling it  i get a couple of appoints out of them  and then someone is sick  or changes positions there s no way for me to develop a healthy trusting relationship with my therapist  this is not an effective way to heal  so fuck it i ll go till i burn out in a glorious explosion of give a fucks and poop,1
81209,remember when the va story broke it was really big news and everyone was talking about it and it was front page on reddit  nothing s changed  stories keep coming out about how nothing s changed  but no one cares either because it s not new anymore  or because of politics  or maybe both i do nt know,1
81210,can anyone explain why the va is so dysfunctional  in short  i do nt get it it seems like they have tons of money but ca nt get their shit together,1

81216,comcast   so what  it s not like you can leave me,9
81217,comcast is used to pissing people off they wo nt give a fuck,9
81218,you could probably just sticky this post  have no link from it or replies available that is how permanent of an issue this is,9
81219,we want google fiber and we want it now,9
81220,if a telephone company has this large a problem  they have to meet with the fcc and show cause most likely there would also be a hefty fine but  not cable networks because they are deemed nonessential,7
81221,not news to me i have a 3 hour outage at least once a month with comcast a 1020 minute outage daily around 56 am  and at least 34 10 minute outages sprinkled throughout the week  i know this because 2 out of every 5 or 6 dvr recorded shows are fucked up during the middle   absolutely awful i live in a moderate city  too  so it s not like i m in the middle of fucking nowhere,7
81222,and then they wonder why people are ready to go to google fibe,7
81223,loss of internet and television access for 3 days would cause mass panic and riot,8
81224,my bad people i went over my 300gb and used way too much of an infinite resource,7
81225,wow  17k outages nationwide for as much as 3 hours  obama needs to step in and fix this for sure ,9
81226,gt  across us i bet i could find thousands who are angry at comcast  in my town alone ,5
81227,i m fully expecting to get downvoted to hell here  but what the heck  i m not particularly fond of comcast  but unless i missed something here  which is entirely possible   this does nt actually sound like it was particularly horrific for people in general it sounds like a very small fraction of their nationwide customer base  had an outage of parts of their service for about 3 or 4 hours  not even all of their service  but things like they could nt access their hd channels  or their internet did nt work for a few hours  i understand for businesses  an internet outage can be a big deal  so some outrage on their part would be justified  but for the general consumer  come on  get a grip go read a book for a while  or go outside for a bit  or  gasp  go do something with your family  i m just not getting what the huge deal was here  what am i missing,7
81228,i was part of the outage did nt have internet and only had access to about 8 sd channels i ll be honest  3 hours where i have to use my phone for internetsi could nt care less had to go out and shovel anyway  edit  couldgt  could n,7
81229,not a fan of comcast  but with this outage they probably still provide 9999  uptime bunch of whiners  yes  i work in it,6
81230,i like how this is news in this country,7
81231,comcast angers me even without outages,7
81232,the words  anger  and  comcast  come up often,4
81233,there needs to be legally mandated uptime and speed requirements  95  of the time your connection must reach the  advertised  speed  no more  up to xmbps  allowed  and 99  of the time it must reach 14 of that speed if this is nt met then customers must be completely refunded for that month,4
81234,is anyone else still completely fucking down  just everything  been down for 15 hours here,4
81235,quote from the article   comcast has more than 27 million customers  and 89000 of those are new cable subscribers the company signed on last quarter that was its best performance in eight years  correct me if i m wrong but are nt there 2 choices for most people  sign up with comcast or do nt have high speed internet  it s like bragging because people choose to eat food from the only supplier rather than starve to death,4
81236,comcast seems to be an isp that people love to hate  charter got so bad for so many years that i loved to hate them in all honesty  the past three to four years or so they have been great,7
81237,customer service replied   working as intended,3
81238,i ve had comcast xfinity for almost 2 years now and i ve never had an issue,5
81239,fun story i was at a friend s place watching the superbowl in denver comcast blacked out cbs with 1 minute 26 seconds left on the clock in second quarter  and service was nt restored till about 15 seconds before 3rd quarter kicked off  idk how widespread this was but lots of denverites did nt get to see the super bowl halftime show i d imagine comcast would lose a lot of money if their advertisers paid to have a certain amount of views and one of the biggest markets  since denver was participating in the super bowl  cut out all views during the entire halftime show idk how their whole contract with that stuff goes though  i hear i did nt miss much though,1
81240,that s what happens things go out sometimes,3
81241,friend of mine called to ask why he couldnt connect  he obviously cant check if there are outages in his neighborhood without the internet  he calls them and they offer to send a tech to his house for like  80  they didnt tell him the price  but you know itd be up there  he spends an hour checking all his connections  digging through paperwork to find his modem settings page  finally calls back about 8hrs later hoping to talk to someone else and theyre like   oh yeah  there s an outage in your area   idiots,1
81242,when i called  i was disconnected 3 times this is great customer nonservice beside the lack of tv thanks comcast for helping me make my change from you  easier,1
81243,it s nothing new that comcast absolutely sucks,1
81244,when you deal with technology  there is only one thing i can guarantee you it will get down at the worst possible time,1
81245, compact angers thousands across the us for something other than just being comcast for once  ftf,1
81246,they just put a data cap on my home internet how fucked is that  pretty fucked if you ask me,1
81247,what is the most troubling about comcast is that when there is an outtage  it doesnt effect just a small region  but instead downs multiple states that seems so rediculous,1
81248,once they fix the outage you re left with  comcast anger thousands across us,1
81249,now only 1000 years to lrrr ruler of the planet omicron persei 8 comes to destroy earth,1
81250,it s not like we re losing  that  much more bandwidth it s only like 20 megs less than what we had before which was only 80 megs less than what we re paying for,1
81251,so  i had to get comcast recently because i moved and noticed something weird about my bill the letter in the mail has a different due date than the due date that shows up on the online account just saying folks make sure to pay 2 days before your date at least,1
81252,just having comcast in general makes them angry,1
81253, nsfw how comcast really feels   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  kmcny_pixdw,1
81254,once in a while fios is out for a few hours hard to get too pissed  these things do happen i do nt think comcast needs an outage to be hated honestly though for me they were a decent provider  i never had a single issue with them except for the occasional outage,1
81255,wow now that s comcastic,1
81256,it was out for like 3 hours jesus christ,1
81257,my comcast service  for the first time in years  has actually been pretty good lately but i d like to pay less  so i m rooting for google fiber to come to boston simply so i can reap the benefits of competition  i mean  that s what we really want  right  we do nt want yet another monopoly  no matter how  altruistic  we think google will be  we want the existing monopolies to be forced into providing quality service for a reasonable price  along with other choices,1
81258,it probably still worked better than my centurylink ds,1
81259,comcast s response   it pays the restoration fee  or else it gets the hose again,1
81260,my case  as in many others  boils down to this  you can pay triple the amount for the same throughput speeds or you can curse comcast and wait for google fiber,1
81261,at the same time  i would nt want to be on the other end and get screamed at from 10k  people experiencing the outage i just went out instead of being at home it s aggregating that it happens so often  at the same time there are other things to d,1
81262,they should just switch providers if they are nt satisfied  see what i did there ,1
81263,after this comcast will just be turning off their services everywhere after all  they could save a ton of money that way,1
81264,for comcast  it was tuesday,1
81265,spread your cheeks  most of you wo nt even complain or ask for a billing credit,1
81266,title should just be  comcast angers thousands across us   i fucking hate comcast with every fiber of my being  reasons  i  paying top dollar for slow as shit internet  ii  a modemrouter combo that broadcasts an unsecured public network from your home which has to be manually deactivated  iib  said modem has to be forced reset once a week  and doing so undoes the manual changes you made to get rid of the second network  iii  arbitrary data caps  iv  live television that freezes  v  ondemand that works infrequently  and turns into minecraft porn when it crashes  vi  customer  service  that refuses to listen to what your problem is  but instead tries to upsell you on a more advanced package  one of my dreams is to live long enough to see this shit stain regional monoploy of a company implode upon itself  or be run straight into the fucking grave by google fiber,1
81267,i always laugh at this shit until i remember i m with twc  the   second   worst rated isp in america,1
81270,gt   the order is vague and because it imposes disproportionate  intrusive  and punitive measures against households and businesses with   no due process     did nt see that one coming,9
81271,isps do nt actually want to spy on their customers like that it costs more money to put systems in place to do so and to maintain and operate those systems on top of that  it will only bring them bad press that could piss off customers  cox is basically saying  fuck you i m not taking a significant financial hit to spy on our customers so you can sue them and make money for yourself  they are doing the right thing  and the right thing also happens to be in their best business interest,9
81272,good guy cox  not selling out their customers  they actually have super reliable internet no outages in any of my apartments so far,9
81273,so to sum that up we do nt have to worry about any cox blocking,9
81274,that s nice  but i m still going to run a vpn,8
81275,all in all i ve been pretty happy with cox as an isp i ve used them in two different cities and it s always been reliable and fast i pay for 300mbps service and always get those speeds  usually higher almost no outages they re putting in 1gbs service in many of their cities right now  including mine  my biggest gripe with them is they have a soft data cap of 2 tb for my tier they do not enforce the caps at all but the fact that they exist means they are probably toying with the idea and there would be nothing to stop them from going evil since they are a monopoly like every other major isp it s like a benevolent dictatorship  http  wwwspeedtestnetmyresult5089441276 that s with a netflix stream going on in another room right now,9
81276,this must be a new thing many a year s ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did nt even know what that was  none of us knew what that even was and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi,7
81277,i ve been really happy with cox for an isp both personally and professionally here in okc personally  out of nowhere they bumped my at home connection from 15mbit to 100mbit and my bill  went down  30  all out of nowhere  without me saying a word internet is always up  not throttled  and they have decent support if it s needed  professionally at my job i ran in ip phone deployment with them for our main office  3 satellite offices they were there 100  of the way i have personal names and numbers to call in the event of issues outside of the scope of my support as the companies it admin  and when we ve needed someone on site to climb a pole for instance their longest response time was 45 minutes  i know this sounds like rhailcorporate but the fact is out of all the isps i ve had  comcast  qwest  charter  etc  they ve been the best that s not saying they should nt and could nt be better  but they re angels next to the others  in fact they proactively contact me at work every once and awhile to check on things which i greatly appreciate and they bring us cookies every month yes  our isp brings yes cookies no  we re not a big company 9 employees they re just nice,8
81278,basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum,8
81279,i used to work for cox in the field and inside cox did have a department that would monitor massive down loading and uploading but they did away with it shortly after i got there  within a year cox ca nt afford to lose customers right now so it s no surprise they are nt allowing this if they did then they would go out of business from customer loss i survived their huge layoff and realignment,5
81280,this is nothing new from cox i have had cox internet for over 10 years and worked for them a few years ago they have always had this attitude toward it s customers the customer pays for internet access  cox provides internet access they do nt even enforce data caps  at least in oklahoma   i have received a few emails due to using so much data suggesting that i switch to a business plan to maximize my speed  but have never been charged extra or cut off due to exceeding a data cap,7
81281,gt  last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers  what the actual fucking fuck,6
81282,as a customer this is the first good thing i ve ever heard from cox,4
81283,not true from my experience,3
81284,i ve had them as an isp for several years and they re excellent i did have one month where i went over my allowed bandwidth limit  300 gb on a 50 mbps down plan   and all i got was an email saying  do nt do that again   no throttling or charges or anything on 100 mbps down plan right now and i usually get 110 at least they re great  come out to me if i m having internet trouble that s not solved by online support  etc pretty good basically  i love cox and i m very satisfied with how much i get,3
81285,unrelated but i could nt stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox,3
81286,i am a proud supporter of cox,3
81287,where are all the penis jokes,3
81288,not as nice as it sounds if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do nt catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status  eg that they do nt have any liabilityresponsibility for what people use their pipe for   most carriers are  very  vested in not being the internet police,3
81289,i m guessing that if they had a way to monetize it and add to the bottom line  they d be very supportive,3
81290,when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battl,5
81291,cox is actually a familyowned business one of the major interest holders is a 96 year old woman who inherited from her father  she had been running it with her sister until her death in 2007   i happen to think they re one of the leastshady isp and cable providers out there  they also own the travel channel  which is a pretty great channel,5
81292,i thought this was talking about jesse cox,4
81293,i work for cox corporate in a startup tech company  and this makes me so happy  btw  they re just as decent an employer as they are an isp compan,3
81294,cox is spying like a champ  rest assured you have to be quite innocent or high on meth to think they have nt supplied info to big brother and his little brothers  and will not in the future,3
81295,yells loudly  i will not    whispers  if you need me too,1
81296,on that headline alone  i thought jessie cox was asked to spy on his youtube subs  was very confused for a little bit,1
81297,i knew he was my favorite eagl,1
81298,well that s one bit of good news from cox now if they d stop raising my rates every few months,1
81299,damn  i wish i had cox i have time warner and i m on my 3rd notice to stop torrenting i do nt know if they ll actually pull the plug  they re charging me out the ass already since they re the only provider in my area,1
81300,fuck yea cox   comcast   1  co,1
81301,cox  and to some extent time warner  are cable companies all cable companies fuck you in the ass  these two have the decency to spit on it first i at the very least get what i pay for with both of them,1
81302,they sent me a few emails in the past  so i got a vpn i will still use it  but good on cox for not being dickbags,1
81303,they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jone,1
81304,i had cox for 3 years service was good  and over that 3 years  doubled my download speeds twice no extra cost upload was still garbage  but hey 10015 internet for  65 a month was still pretty killer i have 7575 fios now,1
81305,almost every single person in my area that has gone to atamp  t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable  they have some shit with them but it s far less shit than others,1
81306,they re my isp and even though they re the only isp in my city besides att and verizon  they ve been awesome,1
81307,the shifting of blame to continue  going after johns and endusers has never worked,1
81308,ho yeah  today is a good day to have cox  teehee,1
81309,horseshit they cut off our internet because someone was downloading something like a year ago they re the best isp i ve ever used  but they absolutely do exactly what the mpaa et al want,1
81310,between cox and cable one in both places i live  i actually like our midwest internet providers i feel bad for people getting rammed by twc and comcast we ve paid  45 for 100mbps for several years  which sounds way better than the horror stories i hear from you guys,1
81311,cause they love internet freedom  or because it costs an extra 30 cents to have an extra indian screen data at the call center for 70 an hour,1
81312,protected pirate plan from cox   7500month,1
81316,colleges really need to stop expelling students due to these kangaroo courts  i m fine with them if it s from breaking a school infraction like alcohol on a dry campus or something of that sort but  if a student is accused of a criminal offense  let the courts deal with it and decide from there  schools are nt equipped to deal with these kinds of cases  nor should they be expected to be these are lifechanging accusations and need to be treated as such  for the benefit of both parties involved,9
81317,gt  ut investigators later decided  that the evidence supported a finding that  he  had sexually assaulted ms roe  the opposite of the conclusion reached by the more experienced detectives of the police department   the lawsuit says the dean of students then recommended he be expelled  ah but the police are looking for evidence that he did it  college tribunals assume he did and require he provide evidence that he did nt  which  typically  the accused is not allowed to present,9
81318,gt  one plaintiff is a 24yearold recent graduate  the other is a 21yearold student who is one semester away from graduating with a bachelor  s degree in physics  their lawsuits say   in the graduate  s case  he faces being banned from any ut system campus  being denied a shot at a ut graduate degree and having a notation put on his transcript   the undergrad faces expulsion in addition to the same punishments  that does nt make any sense to me why would an institution retroactively amend the transcript of someone  who already graduated  to say this person violated school policy  after graduating   this seems to be more evidence that they re trying to scapegoat the plaintiffs here i mean  if they were concerned with the alleged victim s wellbeing more than trying to look  tough on sexual assault   what is the point of amending the transcript,9
81319,who s the idiot who decided that kangaroo courts were a good idea,9
81320,are we to the point where  sexual assaultrape  almost no longer have a meaning    you getting hammered and hooking up with a hammered guy is not rape  nor is it assault he should sue her for the exact same thing,8
81321,i once saw a swedish movie called ondskan   evil  that drove me to become a lawyer today  here  https  enwikipediaorgwikievil_  2003_film   plot one of the key issues that caught my attention in this movie is the disregard of the law the school had to the protagonist s rights when he hired a lawyer  because of some grievance he had with the school  it backed off immediatly when the lawyer lay down the letter of the law to the headmaster of that educational institution in front of all his guests  in this university of texas sexual assault case  i believe imhlo  l is for legal   that the constitution sets a foundation of rules for everyone inside it s jurisdiction  and no internal policy that ut may have can go against the rules set by the us constitution everyone should enjoy the right of being innocent until proven guilty  and time and time again people are being layed off their jobs  students expelled  lives ruined because of yettobeproven  accusations  the right thing that any institution  like ut  should always do is address all cases of criminal behavior by always recognizing first the accused innocence until proven guilty in a court of law  edit  grammar,8
81322,gt  the friend said she thought the woman was conscious because  when she saw her kissing this man  she was awake and talking  the lawsuit says  so intentionally or not the woman who claimed to be assaulted is not telling the truth  editand they decided to expel him without even talking to the student his first chance to give his side was an appeal for his expulsion this is a fucking kangaroo court  edit2  the second lawsuit claims expulsion against a student was recommended without the alleged victim ever personally making a sex assault accusation  http  kxancom20160205lawsuitsagainstutallegebiasagainstmalesinsexassaultcase,9
81323,gt  the undergrad  s lawsuit says he had sex with a woman who was not a ut student after leaving a house party near campus sometime after midnight on march 6  2015 about a month later  the woman  s father called ut police and accused the man of sexually assaulting his daughter  fuck this i understand that if a woman is  actually  rapedmolestedassaulted it could be hard to come forward  but waiting a month or longer and  then  reporting it is bullshit you get raped  you report it immediately the longer you wait  the more i m going to doubt your accusation,7
81324,gt  university police never spoke to the woman the undergrad was accused of assaulting and no criminal charges were ever pursued  his lawsuit says the father  s report was referred to the ut dean of students  okay what the hell  seriously  though its this sort of thing that makes me really hate schools handling sexual assault cases on their own the police did nt even talk to the accused victim  but decided to tell the dean instead  it feels like it happens all the time when we have these alternate systems of punishment we stop treating crimes like crimes and treat them like rule infractions a rule infraction is cheating on a test an alleged assault is a crime treat it like one,7
81325,eli5 kangaroo courts thanks,8
81326,activist administrators  check lack of due process  check prohibited from legal council or cross examination of the accuser  check nothin to see here  move along people,6
81327,well  they are probably right these school kangaroo courts have demonstrated they have no respect for the privacy and rights of the accused  and are only interested in demonstrating how seriously they take sexual assault accusations,6
81328,male privilege,8
81329,the real lesson here is do nt trust anyone i certainly do nt anymore,6
81330,reddit is nt okay with witch hunts  but the university of texas and 1600s salem encourage them,7
81331,stay away from liberal colleges  they are cesspools of tumblrina ideals  i could barely stand the required diversity classes from my public university nothing but priviledge  patriarchy  and man hatin,8
81332,it seems to me that a public institution has to follow the sixth amendment  which grants  the right to a public trial without unnecessary delay  the right to a lawyer  the right to an impartial jury  and the right to know who your accusers are and the nature of the charges and evidence against you,6
81333,jane roe because jane doe would be incest,4
81334,so these students that are expelled do they have to still pay back their loans even though they do nt get a degree now and can they carry their credits over to another school or are they now worthless,5
81335,i love how at the end she implies that if there were a person punching people randomly on campus they would choose to not involve the police presumably so that the assault victims could  control their own destiny,3
81336,30 year old here  and planning on returning to school with all this insanity about social values exploding everywhere  i may just hold off a few more years and wait for school to become a profitable idea again,3
81337,gt  the university has been placed under enormous political pressure to appear tough on those accused of sexual assault  there s your problem right there how about be tough on those convicted of sexual assault and those whom the law decides are innocent be treated as such,3
81338,umso expel the drunken slut too  right  i could get behind that they both got drunk and made bad choices that reflect poorly on the school kick em both out  why only the male  did he conspire in some way to get her drunk  if they re both adults that got drunk and fucked then they re both equally guilty,7
81339,considering that almost every case of a rape accusation that s come out massively public has been shown to be fraudulent  i m reserving judgement on this one,3
81340, ut investigates more than 100 allegations of sexual assault a year  and that number is growing  liebman said   how the hell are there hundreds of allegations a year that s insane this reminds me of the play the crucible  i saw you with the devilcommunistscapitalists  homo raptorus,1
81341,damned if you do damned if you dont,1
81342,seems like the girl was so hammered that she could nt remember the sex figured it would be less shameful if she accused him of assault,1
81345,i was happier before i knew this subculture existed,9
81346,so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10 that does nt make much sense,9
81347,how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killedhow from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human,9
81348,one of these videos was sent to me many years ago  forwarded on a myspace page  yeah  many  years ago   they were trying to  raise awareness  when they sent it to me to help the people get caught  but all they really ended up doing was spreading that ghastly thing to more points of the internet i wo nt describe a single second of it  but suffice it to say that it s horrifying i ve never been able to remove the memory i ve been through a lot in my military career  and yet seeing a 2minute version of one of those videos was easily the most horrible thing i have ever witnessed,9
81349,gt  brent justice  54  was convicted and sentenced monday for cruelty to nonlivestock animals  i guess justice has been served,9
81350,i ca nt imagine the mentality of the person making it or watching it and people get off on it    who the hell sees a cat being stabbed in the eye and thinks  hey  time to get the jergens  ,9
81351,no complaints from me but i ve noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago,9
81352,for once  reading a story of horrifying animal abuse does nt fill me with rage this must be what justice feels like finally  an appropriate sentence so sick of people like these getting slaps on the wrist due to inadequate animal protection laws,9
81353,i read the title then thought  hhmmm what s an animal crush video   who would have thunk it  animal crush videos are videos of animals getting crushed there goes some of the little remaining faith i had in humanit,9
81354,psa  if for some reason you come here first  and you do nt know what crush videos are  please do nt look them up,8
81355,i m not saying this is nt some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder,9
81356,who the fuck beats off to animals being killed  what the fuc,7
81357,i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens wtfi just dont understan,8
81358,houston man is trying to compete with florida man  and this is definitely an act i hope florida man does nt try to top,8
81359,there are some very fucked up people in this world to me  it is inconceivable how someone does this,8
81360,only 10 minutes in  and i ve already had enough reddit for today,6
81361,gt  investigators said justice filmed a scantily clad richards  sometimes masked  stabbing animals  including a puppy  a kitten and a chicken  as well as chopping off their limbs and urinating on them while making sexual comments to the camera  what the actual fuck,6
81362,you know when you really  really wish you had nt read the article linked to  this is one of those times right now,7
81363,you can kill your spouse  drunk drive and kill 4 people  steal millions of dollars from the american people  or molest dozens of children in a church of a period of 30 years and literally get less jail time when we say we love our doggos  and kittys   we fucking mean it,6
81364,i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective it was the first exposure i d ever had to this subculture  crush fetish   after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals  their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse that s all i have to say about that,1
81366,as someone who just for the first time heard the term animal crush videos  i wash that i had nt something is seriously wrong with you if this is what gets you off,7
81367,well that just ruined my da,6

81370,if slaughter houses had glass walls  everyone would quit eating animals the cognitive dissonance in here is incredible,5
81371,i definitely think this guy should be punished and i m glad he was punished  but it blow my mind how a guy like this can get 50 years and a pedophile or rapist can get 1020 or less,5
81372,i do nt understand how the sicko who did the maiming and killing gets 10 years  but the man who filmed it gets 50 that woman should not see light ever again,1

81407,personally working as security guard in a hospital  and having to deal with people who have mental health issues its not fun  or safe and generally the actual hospital staff is nt very helpful i ve been kicked in the head  punched in the face  and many other things happen sometimes these people can not be handled and tazeing could deescalate the situation,4
81408,from what i ve read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops it looks like the taser use was justified sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca nt be deescalated otherwise  has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died,6
81409,this is unacceptable tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are nt,7
81410,he died 5 days later at a different hospital  clickbait headline i m sure we ll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death,6

81423,given the propensity of anonymous for leaking confidential and private information of people who do nt share their viewpoints  i do nt know how super private it would stay if someone expressed a contrary opinion would my belief that kanye is an immature narcissist result in release of the name and location of my virginity loss  or my 2nd grade teacher  btw  not the same person ,6
81424,i bet tom from facebook is already a membe,3
81425,gt  but unlike its competitors it doesn  t aim to make money from gathering data  instead  it encrypts all messages  so that they can  t be read by advertisers or by governments  so how does it make money to pay for development  management  support  bandwidth  and servers  i do nt know how this shit gets reported slow news day  remember that stupid  social network  diaspora  they got global coverage about their facebook alternative i do nt think they ever even finished the product  let alone had anyone use it  must be built by the son of some important news editor who can drum up publicity this is likely the same,3
81426,so if i log into reddit on the tor network and my verification email account  if i were to use one  was anonymous  would nt that be the same thing,3
81427,facebook s shills are working overtime in this posts comments i hope this social media site becomes a viable alternative,3

81447,gt  reached for comment on saturday  a highway patrol official said the motorcycle driver who was leading the procession was pulled over after attempting to halt traffic in the no 5 lane so that the motorcade could pass  gt  gt  although the officer initiated the traffic stop on the lead vehicle only  and indicated to other members of the procession that they could continue on  some of them chose to pull over as well  said sgt jose nunez  a chp spokesman  gt  gt  the motorcycle driver was cited for illegal lighting  and his vehicle was impounded because his driver s license was not current  according to nunez    gt   it exceeds the bounds of all human decency   said family attorney edward ramsey  an officer has the discretion to stop or not stop a funeral procession if it was me  i would have probably escorted this procession to the burial  he did nt stop the funeral procession  all he did was stop the unlicensed driver that was breaking the la,6
81448,police pulls over escort vehicle  funeral pulls over  well boys  it looks like we now know who did nt know where the fucking graveyard was  but nooooooooo  it s  obviously  because they re black  or something  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  sy_yf4zzy,1
81449,so an illegal escort vehicle gets pulled over and the entire funeral pulls over to raise hell,5
81450,good the roads are for the living have your moments at the funeral please,4
81451,what s bizarre is this concept of  respect  for the dead by parading the corpse around  or what s left of it after it s been embalmed that shit is just fucking weird burn it and get on with it do nt fuck up an interstate just because of your idiotic traditions,1
81452,the entitlement attitude of so many americans  gt  if it was me  i would have probably escorted this procession to the burial  your funeral escort was driving without a valid license the chp was correct to pull him over and cite him the rest of the funeral procession was free to continue on but you chose to pull over instead that was your own decision that caused you to be late the funeral  what is so aggravating to me about this is the family will file a lawsuit and probably win they will get to think they are right but they will milk the taxpayers of thousands of dollars,1
81453,got ta love reddits horrible bias with facts when it comes to the police,
81455,fucking sad how this was nt described as an act of terrorism i guess that title is reserved for nonchristians,9
81456,it is sad that it closed even for a short time people like fiorina do nt give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time,8
81457,definitely not terrorism though  just a little rampage  you know he was probably having a bad day or something,8
81458,good for them  dont let those freedom hating assholes scare you away from your job,8
81459,how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him,4
81460,is carly out of the race yet  i do nt think that rightwing  fringe conartist is done riling up her terrorist sect,6
81461,deadly rampage  was  terrorist attack  a little too onthenose,6
81462,why does this headline say  deadly rampage  and not  christian terrorism ,6
81463,now i m not a fan of abortions but who the hell can think to themselves i know how to stop babies from being aborted  i ll just shoot all the moms and their doctors  absolute lunatic,3
81464,thank god its back open now we can get back to crushing fetus  heads and sucking their brains out like normal people,
81465,on president s day   the gaul,
81466,so  someone went on a shooting rampage and killed people in order to stop planned parenthood from killing people  but now planned parenthood is open again  and proudly killing people  well  i am glad that worked out the entire thing makes tons of sense,
81467,pp is where there is regular deadly rampages against unborn babies,

81494,has nt he already had  like  two years to prevent this in the first place,7
81495,lansing has actually dealt with this problem and their civil engineers have a solution which is both fast and more costeffective than traditional measures they connect the end of the new pipe to the old pipes so when they pull out the old pipe they simultaneously thread the new pipes into the existing space this speeds up the process and the people in lansing estimate with adequate training  involving them with the process in flint  and hiring enough crews it can be completed for flint in one year,7
81496,this whole situation is a national embarrassment  and it makes my blood boil  but what does naacp have to do with city water  is it a race issue as well  i ve never seen the demographics on flint  come to think of it  maybe aspca should get involved  too i bet people are still feeding their pets city water no matter what  edit  i just think it should be about officials   doing their fucking jobs    framing it as a race issue might just come back to bite us  who knows how many towns are discreetly checking for  and finding  elevated lead  should it matter how many african americans live there  if so  how should officials proceed differently  will it result in a process of public relations triage  that prioritizes black communities  public officials just need to do their fucking jobs for the public they serve there s no need to complicate this with race,5
81497,that s like threatening to get one of those online white house petitions going it does nt matter,1
81498,fix flint s water pipes or they ll burn flint to the ground,3
81499,i m all for getting this fixed as quickly as possible but i also do nt want something rushed either figure it out figure it out right,1
81500,okayand then what  all of the protesting has nt done jack so far what s one more protest going to do  it s not going to make the state government move any faster  it s very clear that the government  at every level  is more concerned about covering itself a protest is nt going to change that,
81501,sooooo glad i do nt live in flint  that place sounds like a complete disaster,
81502,who the fuck are they to demand this  are whiteasianlatino people not allowed to be affected by this,
81504,from  government  s memorandum in support of its motion for pretrial detention   http  wwwscribdcomdoc29947153421616doc4usavclivenbundyusadetentionmemorandumforclivenbundy  gt  bundy is lawless and violent he does not recognize federal courts  claiming they are illegitimate  does not recognize federal law  refuses to obey federal court orders  has already used force and violence against federal law enforcement officers while they were enforcing federal court orders  nearly causing catastrophic loss of life or injury to others he has pledged to do so again in the future to keep federal law enforcement officers from enforcing the law against him as of the date of this hearing  he continues to violate federal court orders and continues to possess the proceeds of his illegal activities  gt  gt  bundy is currently charged with crimes of violence including using and brandishing firearms in connection with crimes of violence under title 18  united states code  section 924  c   as such  the bail reform act presumes that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that will ensure the safety of the community 18 usc  3142  e   3   b   here  no evidence has been adduced during the investigation of the instant charges that even remotely hints at a rebuttal to that presumption in fact  all the evidence suggests that bundy will continue to act lawlessly  will not abide by court orders  and will use violence to ensure that federal laws are not enforced as to him,8
81505, bundy asked for a courtappointed attorney at his first hearing last week  still living off govt handouts i see,8
81506,gt  bundy   his  attorney said  would go to court in nevada if ordered to do so   right  sure i mean  it s not like he s ever defied the government before  and he  totally  recognises it s legitimacy  gt  but judge stewart said if bundy was released   i  m guessing that  s the last we  ll ever see of mr bundy  a wise and perspicacious judge,9
81507, daughterinlaw briana bundy said tuesday that a federal judge in oregon should let the 69yearold live at home while he awaits trial  sure that s an excellent suggestion i would further suggest that the judge prepare a lunch of peanut butter sandwiches with home made raspberry jam and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies for mr bundy each day,8
81508,gt  the judge said bundy  69  is a flight risk and a danger to the community in the bail hearing tuesday afternoon in downtown portland i mean i ca nt really find a reason not to agree with that a 69 year old who does nt believe he s beholden to the law is as dangerous as a 29 year old who does nt believe he s beholden to the law,8
81509,they are just misunderstood they did this for free sex toys,7
81510,not sure he was the worst member of ya llquaida  http  mwashingtontimescomnews2014apr15formersheriffwillingletwifedaughterdiefron,6
81511,hope he gets the  negros  there to hear his theory or their culture and living style,1
81512,the man is a wellmeaning but ideologically obsessed idiot the government has handled this clusterfuck extremely well  and i am not one to say that lightly,6
81513,it s important for the government to provide a consistent and cohesive narrative if they are to help squash future acts of rebellion cliven bundy and his ilk are lawless  violent  redneck anarchists and none of the things they protested had any validity whatsoever,5
81514,good  this arrest and trial has been delayed for too long,7
81515,given his history  bundy is as dangerous as a monkey with a straightrazor,4
81516,where is the groundswell of the righteously indignant right wing militia that was supposed to come to his aid,1
81517,mmmmmm i need some of the bundy range fed beef i hope the feds seize it all soon and put it up for sale,1
81518,so anyone knows how long a trial like this could last,1
81519,yalqueda finally facing justice,1
81520,well then that s that,1
81521,does this mean that harry reid s son s land deal can finally go through,
81523,why did nt they care this much about their freaking  home   remember all those reporters and camera crews contaminating all that evidence after the shooting it was live on cnn ffs,7
81524,i do believe they are nt understanding that the phone ca nt be decrypted by apple or anyone,7
81525,even if they wrote a program to stop the wait time or not wipe phone after a certain amount of failed attempts  you would still need to get inside the phone to implement it,3
81526,this is what the fbi was looking for  the one terrorist case it can trumpet to prove it needs to unlock anyone s phone at any time,1
81527,why not just dump the phones firmware and then brute force it there  learn2nsa fb,1
81528,under what law or authority can a third party company be compelled to take some action  other than testifying  in a criminal case  can the feds order a construction company to build a house  can they order a car manufacturer to build a custom version of a car,1
81530,at least the guy was honest,4
81531,i would nt be mad if it was my wallet,1
81532,how do they know the guy was homeless,1
81534,how do i get one of these fuck around on the internet jobs,9
81535,because twitter has been such a phenomenal business succes,9
81536,gt  luckie  s new role will entail working with media organizations  as well as government organizations  to understand how they  re currently using reddit and what their needs are from the platform  luckie told me he  ll then take that feedback and build it into reddit  s product  with the goal of making reddit more accessible to a broader community of people  so reddit will listen to what they like and dislike and then hand feed us whaat they want us to hear no longer will it be us posting what we find interesting and up or down voting it for exposure as much as it is meant to be  that s what i am hearing just another nail,9
81537,gt  the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do nt we have that subreddit already ,8
81538,will this have an impact on integrity within certain front page  news related  and default subs concerning submissionsdeletionsetc,5
81539,so more sponsored posts too bad voatco is such a shitty alternative,8
81540,the entire article talks about his race  reddit  you are a disappointing piece of shit,7
81541,i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites,7
81542,so is his job to come around and censor our posts,6
81543,great  now reddit is stealing other people s diversity hires  jesus  there really is just no oc on this site anymore  is there,6
81544,just as a precaution  i think we all should be putting on our life jackets,6
81545,does this dude give off  profitability  pixie dust when he walks around the office  what is causing all of these companies  reddit  yahoo  twitter  vox  salon  mashable  github  gawker  etc  in decline to try and make up for shitty business practices with diversity hires  it does nt matter how many black activist and feminists you hire  that wont solve a lack of profitability and coming from a company that tanked  and you were suppose to be part of the solution  is nt exactly a gold star on your resume you are suppose to jump ship from companies that are failing not get on board,7
81546,aka manipulator in chief,5
81547,so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming and this was the great marketing that is killing them,6
81548,that seems like quite a comedown  with all due respect to this fine institution,3
81549,let s see what shitty changes they come up with 144 character limit  perhaps,4
81550,it s about ethics in reddi,3
81551,just read about how twitter is filtering political content of a particular kind good news for reddit  they re on their way to being another propaganda wing of the left,1
81552,great  a news manager  amp  head of journalism  with the attention span of one sentence  and the intellectual depth of a drunk on a 24 hour train ride  note  reddit is a whore for anything that emanates out of the roman catholic ponzi generating pope s pie hole perhaps the new head of journalism  could find another criminal organization to support on reddit instead of the catholic church criminal empire,
81554,i lived 200yds from a burn pit when i was there in 04 i had some skin disease for about 2 years after iraq and some kind of asthma the va did nt give a shit then and they still do nt care  so  i got that goin for me,9
81555,i was in tikrit  cob speicher  from 08 to 09 i lived a few hundred feet from the  burn pit  it was basically a huge junk yard with 3 huge constantly burning rectangular pits they were about 75 feet long and 50 feet across iirc you could see black or white smoke billowing from the area all the time i had to go there at least once a week to dump trash imagine standing over a red hot fire throwing junk off the back of a flatbed truck while it was 130 degrees outside sometimes the smog was so thick driving through the junk yard  that you could nt see 50 feet in front of you the smoke would almost always linger around the base and it smelled awful olfactory fatigue did not apply here it always smelled no matter how long you d be  exposed  you never got used to it never mind that they burned our shit right next door i remember one day we had to do a pt test the 2 mile run was on the same road as the burn pit smoke everywhere nobody passed that day some people were puking at the end i usually ran a 13  45 2 mile and i remember getting over 17 minutes i was gasping for air at the end we all thought the course was marked out incorrectly  but when we measured it later that day it was exactly 2 miles needless to say  nobody ever had any respiratory protection around these things  ever nor were we ever told we needed them i mean we had our gas masks in our gear  but nobody wanted to be  that guy  damn  we used to joke about it all the time whenever someone would start spewing some  war story   or when some freshoutabasic private would try to tell us about  that one time my drill sergeant made us do this  story   at the end we d say   yeah  but have you ever been to the burn pit    then we d laugh it off i guess it s not so funny anymore,8
81556,my husband  half  jokes about the cancer he s going to get from the burn pits in afghanistan from what he described  they were horrible,7
81557,this hits close to home we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight i really need to get this checked out,7
81558,i can understand why burning trash and human waste may be unavoidable in certain military circumstances like in those remote outposts in afghanistan that might house 1520 people  there really are nt any good alternatives  however it seems less defensible to not have invested in better infrastructure once you had permanent bases the size of small cities  once you re at the point where soldiers had their own little airconditioned houses made out of cargo containers with air conditioning  satellite television  and onbase burger king it seems like you can probably invest in some proper trash incinerators instead of open burn pits,7
81559,gt  though the us government disputes it well  color me surprised,8
81560,a tsgt i know died recently from cancer he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family he was 32 his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer,7
81561, support our troops with a ribbon sticker   that will definitely make up for all the fucked up shit the government puts them through,7
81562,not surprised saw a guy in the va who used to jog through the base with his unitteam  not sure of the terminology   breathing in the smoke from one of these every day for 4 years he had some chronic lung condition we were working up  and said a couple of his buddies also have lung problems now otherwise perfectly healthy 40 years old  completely unnecessary illness due to stupidity andor apathy,6
81563,http  wwwpublichealthvagovexposurescamplejeune for decades  the government knowingly allowed service members and their dependents to consume contaminated tap water fifteen diseases are recognized to have a direct relation to the contamination but many more are cropping up yet the government wo nt recognize those  yet   and they re filing motions to have claims tossed out based on statute of limitations  even though the government did nt even announce the contamination until over a decade after the wells were closed  this is nt just an agent orange or iraq war contamination where soldiers were exposed and have problems babies born at the base hospital hadhave an alarmingly high rate of birth defects but nothing is being done about it and the va continues to deny claims we ll just go ahead and add this one to the list,6
81564,uhh i ve had a severe cough for 34 years now  since coming back from afghanistan  it ll get so bad  that i ll cough until i throw up  and then cough more  the va said it was normal i m sure they know what they re talking about i feel fine,6
81565,i remember having to sit through a 2 hour briefing the first week i arrived in iraq  back in 2008 we were told that scientists verified that the burn pit on base was not a detriment to our health  then we had to sign forms when i returned stateside  there were quite a few reports of people having respiratory issues after returning from deployment  the va also denied that any illnesses were related to desert storm it took a long time for anyone other than veterans to admit that desert storm syndrome was a real thing  and then said veterans had to go through the gauntlet of proving their illnesses were related to their deployment,7
81566,goddamn  it s unbelievable the way vets are treated shame,6
81567,government does nt give a fuck about veterans,5
81568,my 36yo buddy was just diagnosed with nonhodgkens lymphoma when he visited the va to do the paperwork they asked what bases he served at overseas  and literally had a list of diseases to reference per base just got a  yep  here it is probably from the burn pit  from the clerk thumbing down the list when he told me i was blown away  why is nt there any followup with soldiers who served at these bases    even a simple  you may want to get screened  when he returned from service would have given us some hope of getting in front of it it s incredibly irritating,5
81569,the us lying about iraq and afghanistan  nah  never happen,7
81570,do nt worry guys we ll take care of your medical needs when you come home oh wait,5
81571,do nt forget area 51 they had burn pits like you would nt believe stealth materiels that had top secret components in them the poor guys that were exposed to all of this could nt even go for help  many died in secrecy  i know i was exposed to vaporized depleted uranium and who knows what else i have a sort of bet with my self that i ll die an early death,5
81572,so  the dod did nt learn any lessons from previous burn pits  i mean  when you have to declassify area 51 because of workers health decline due to burn pits  you d think you d remember this shit is wrong,5
81573, though he returned home safely in september 2009  he woke up one day a few months later with an inexplicable headache  numbness in his limbs and paralysis on one side of his body beau had suffered a mild stroke his health deteriorated  and he was diagnosed with brain cancer less than two years later  he died at the age of 46  holy fuck    fuck wars and politicians that start them,4
81574,the us govt so cares about its troops,7
81575,i ve known military to have permanent letters added to their medical records saying they have been exposed to the worst man made hazarddisaster since chernobyl,4
81576,does kaf still have the shit pond  on another note  im going to have this checked out the va has this on their website somewhere  they sent an email,4
81577,there are so many things wrong with this i do nt even know what to say  let s just purposefully burn hazardous material  petroleum products  chemicals  and batteries next to our camp oh  and throw some explosives in there while you re at it and vaporizes all that shit so we can breath it in are you kidding me,4
81578,holy shit  my friend who was on the poop burning detail a bunch of times died of throat cancer earlier this year my first thought was it was the poop burning that did it  and i m concerned as well because i did my fair share of that as well,4
81579,where we lived there was a burn pit that was nearby and the smoke would always float over to where we were  as of yet i dont have any symptoms but i do have a begine growth in my head  i have had it checked but i am paranoid that it could become bad ,4
81580,little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did nt have to bother to actually lob chemicalbio weapons at us we d send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chembio bomb themselves  did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney,4
81581,every time i allow myself a shred of regret for not enlisting  i remind myself that this kind of shit is what the us does to its soldiers fuck that i respect your service and all that  but fuck that shit,1
81582,every goddamn war the military has to do something that exposes troops to dangerous chemicals,3
81583,makes me wonder  i was at camp addertallil back in 2010  2011  what was i exposed to,3
81584,i was in taji in 2011 2 people got cancer after our deployment  lots of people were having breathing problems we were right next to the tank graveyard and the burn pit was constantly going in our rush to shut down theater i ve gotten lung infections every year since then,3
81585,just like at area 51  same shit never changes,3
81586,thank god i saved my hazardous exposure memos from balad and taji if ne1 needs message privatel,3
81587,ctrlf  kandahar poo pond  no results son  i am disappoint,3
81588,where is this going to lead to,3
81589,the horrors of our war in iraq seem to never en,3
81590,i read that as  us military burns pit bulls ,3
81591,do nt know if anyone who got sick is interested in  this   http  wwwgelmanscomreadingroomtabid65ctlarticleviewmid372articleid526burnpitsclaimsaspx  but here ya go,3
81592,ca nt be  bush lied  right  right ,3
81593,my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well,1
81594,that was one messy cakewalk,5
81595,they should turn on the masters and their supporters,3
81596,so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them,3
81597,i thought iraq did nt have wmd s,4
81598,be sure and vote gop they re the gift that keeps on giving   you give cancer to the army you have  not the army you wish you had,1
81599,such a simple solution  rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacement,
81600,am i the only one who read that at first as burn pit bulls,
81606,i ve never heard of court on a saturday thats pretty crazy,9
81607,the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though,9
81608,it should be interesting to see how she s ruled in cases of dui in the past,9
81609,she refused a breathalyzer meh she ll beat thi,9
81610,would nt being drunk compromise her ability to judge  how many times has she been impaired while working  should nt anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least  what should i make for dinner,9
81611,offitherrrr i am the la,9
81612,no one has mentioned this yet but she got pulled over at 8 am drinking in the morning  this judge has some problems,9
81613,rochesterian here the article failed to mention that she was also driving with 2 flat tires for who knows how long,8
81614,in fairness  if i was a judge in rochester i d need a few drinks before work too,9
81615,i drove through rochester today  has anyone ever heard of a garbage plate,9
81616,new york has pretty harsh dui laws if my memory serves me correctl,8
81617, it s fucking vodka maaaaaaaaaan    https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  r5h6ie_hd_g,8
81618,that would suck to have your case decided by a slurring women,9
81619,if i know new york this should be a nasty slap on this wrist especially for those in powerful position,7
81620,what seems to be the officer  problem,6
81621,well who s gon na judge the case now,5
81622,her judgement was impaire,6
81623,fry needs to weigh in here  http  imgurcomgvji0u,6
81624,to be clear  the fact that she refused a breathalyzer is important in many states it is treated as evidence of impairment and justification for arrest she knew that i have many friends who are criminal defense attorneys and all have told me they advise to refuse breathalyzer always  unless there is a court order  i m not familiar with ny law  but i can pretty much guarantee she will not be convicted of dui if middle classcollege kids can get out of them  a federal judge surely can since it said nothing about a field sobriety test  i assume they either did nt administer one  or they did and she did not meet criteria for impairment,5
81625,my friends mom is a judge and that lady boozes super hard and will drive her car around i have seen her come home from the bar completely in ruins at least a dozen times over the last 10 years she is fearless  we live in a small town in wisconsin with a huge police presence she knows all the officers and has never had an issue the whole situation seems completely ridiculous she gives out sentences for dui all day and then drives drunk all night oh god  the hypocrisy,5
81626,ny state troopers only care about the star program more tixarrest  promotionmoney so if they could get points on there own mother they would,5
81627,i m just amazed that our local news channel in lafayette is on the front page of reddit x,5
81628,regardless of judge plates  why shouldare judges treated any differently  if i expect to get pulled over and ticketed for 5mph over i believe a judge should too especially since they make 15 times the income,5
81629,i feel like poor judgement like this should make you not a judge anymore,4
81630,oh they decided the law applies today,5
81631,many  if not most  political figures are serious alcoholics when you combine the constant parties and  fundraisers  that they are expected to attend with the stress of the job  a lot of them end up drinking a lot,8
81632, spits out drink   it s fucking vodka man ,7
81635,once the cop shows up to your convenience store robbery  it s time to call it quits  what the fuck did he think he was getting away with,9
81636,good on his father for turning in his son for this crime that cant be an easy thing to do but he did the right thing,9
81637,father of five  damn best wishes to officer couch and his loved ones,8
81638,sounds like he may make it gt   he s doing as good as can be expected   couch s father  alozo hardiman  told the station  it s touch and go we are praying for him and god knows best,7
81639,i believe we have gangs that are setting these kids up with a hair trigger  and along comes a cop that sets them off  we need to get to the root problem as well as locking up the kids,7
81640,that fucker is 19  looks 3,7
81641,i hope the cop gets better,7
81642,dont ever let this shithead have an ounce of freedo,8
81643,how does a bullet fragment if it enters through the eye,6
81644,he s a really meanlooking kid  i do nt know if he always wears that scowl  or if it s just for the mugshot,5
81645,19 years old and your life s over for the contents of a cash register justwhy,3
81646,wish people would stop shooting cops it s making them all scared and trigger happy,1
81647,kinda looks like trayvon martin and mike brown had a kid,1
81648,where s all the blm people now  i mean it s a black cop and all conflict of interest  or does nt fit your super combo of white cop and dead black kid,
81649,i do nt understand reddit says that loggers and farmers have more dangerous jobs,
81650,another prime blm example,
81651,hope he gets a fair trial y,
81652,so this guy is innocent until proven guilty right  why is this investigation so short  we do nt know the details  why does it take a year to investigate an officer for shooting someone  and this takes a couple of days to charge this guy  is that disconnect enough to make anyone here question things enough to accept that there is a massive encompassing problem with our legal system  i always have to wonder because we see many of the same people calling for people to wait for details after an officer shoots someone  telling us not to be monday morning quarterbacks then stories like this pop up and we have those same people frothing at the mouth in this situation where it has nt been given the year plus of investigation that an officer who shoots someone would be given the guy is already guilty despite the cries to give officers the benefit of the doubt because of the innocent until proven principle,
81653,how the hell do you survive a gunshot to the face  that s some 50 cent shit,
81654,this thread https  wwwredditcomraskredditcomments460zpfwithout_insulting_anyone_what_would_you_say_tod01ln3,
81655,it s about damn time we made sure innocent good people had guns and training and could defend themselves   or we could stop giving guns to everybody gee i do nt know,
81656,maybe the cop was making furtive movements,
81659,its really a shame that this is even nessesar,9
81660,coulda gave that money to kany,9
81661,these responses wow,9
81662,good god rnews commentary is really descending to the level of youtube comments  get a grip you sad sods,8
81663,may god bless him he is a true patriot spend the money for the future generation through the preservation of our national treasures,9
81664,how many hellfire missiles would that buy,8
81665,this is a great thing people who are bashing him do not make much sense the monuments in dc are one of the united states  greatest treasures  and likewise they cost a lot to maintain let alone refurbish they are a public venue that is traversed by millions and are awesome to each person that visits  this guy decided to use some of his money to give back and better public places that reside in our nation capital and some see him as an asshole  it is one thing to be bitter about not having that kind of money  it is another thing to get pissed when someone with money gives back,7
81666,its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring,3
81667,good for him i remember the lincoln memorial being one of my more favorite monuments i d like to take my son there some day  so it s nice to see it will be upgraded and fixed up  to all the naysayers and negative commenters  fuck you,5
81668,in this thread hooray  what an awesome guy and  also fuck him  he should have used pennie,6
81669,how is he a philanthropist  he s giving money to statues  not to people maybe he s a philstatuist,5
81670,congratulations  you just bought  18 million worth of  charity shaming   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  aksowj8agwo ,3
81671,how dare that onepercenter not keep that money to themselves it s as if they are nt evil like sanders wants you to believ,1
81672,i think it s great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about what i do nt like is that there should nt even be an issue with funding for our monuments,4
81673,if we re committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i m all for it,1
81674,i wonder how many huge donations like this  maybe smaller  in the hundreds of thousands  have been made for national monuments pretty awesome someone did this wo reading the article  i have to imagine there s a good amount of rigmarole on the donor s end to ensure the donation goes to where the donor actually wanted govt accountability on any level in the us seems kind of weak lately,1
81675,all right  a 15000sqft exhibit room underneathkind of like the one in fallout ,3
81676,can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too,
81677,oh cool thanks  philanthropist guy,3
81678,wow  what an honorable thing to do  while 99  of people in his position would spend the money on useless crap  this guy chooses to spend his money on something so selfless and so much bigger than himself  this guy is a good 1  e,
81679,it d be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro,1
81680,that s nice for a full on rapist to do,
81681,let s laugh at people in need by blowing tens of millions on nonessential shit that basically benefits nobody in any significant way  edit  and get tax breaks from it too,1
81682,no matter what some peasant is going to whine rich guy should ve just kept his money to himself and these poors would nt even know  i thank him  i ll go to dc eventually the whiners here probably could nt afford any type of vacation  or if they could  only by living paycheck to paycheck,
81683,we are living in a new gilded age,
81684,i certainly appreciate what david has done here but  with all due respect to david  most americans would rather not see financial industry groups  like the carlyle group  suck economic resources out ofaway from most americans instead  we d prefer to pay for these efforts through widespread  robust economic opportunities and the tax contributions they make possible millions of americans and this nation have been greatly diminished as a result of the business activities of groups  like the carlyle group  over several decades  because of grotesque incomewealth inequality  the odds of seeing successful businesspeople like david rubinstein are greatly diminished he only got where he was because of the social ladder that used to exist in this nation,
81685,how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions,
81686,it s gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface themfight to take them down,
81687,those goddamn rich people are at it again  dammit if we could only find a way to tax away their wealth so we could spend it on poorly negotiated deals for mediocre roads and bridges,
81688,wow  what a waste of money,
81689,fixing stupid shit is hardly philanthropy,
81690,i m pretty sure there are roads around there that could have used that money  priorities  people,
81691,because republicans refuse to pay for it from fed budget ,
81692,congratulations  you just bought  18 million worth of  charity shaming   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  aksowj8agwo ,
81693, 18 million  that could have stopped about 6000 kids from dying of malaria   http  wwwgivewellorginternationaltopcharitiesamf  costperlifesaved   one man s philanthropist is another man s guy who does nt see the big picture,
81697,i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic,9
81698,for those unaware  he is one of the marines who carried sgt major kasal out of the fallujah  hellhouse  it is  in my opinion  one of the most iconic photos of the iraq war this photo  https  iimgurcomtezsn9zjp,9
81699,i live in dc groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day never makes the news public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do nt know what they are doing worst part it s never anyone who will fight back not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 1315 but they have seriously injured folks in the past brain damage and internal bleeding i typically avoid groups of young black men now i feel a little bad about it like i m being racist but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted,9
81700,another article with some details  http  dailycallercom20160215marineallegedlyassaultedmidburgeratmcdonaldsasgangyelleddoyoubelieveblacklivesmatte,9
81701,this is why i support gun ownership,8
81702,inb4 this thread gets nuked by the mods,9
81703,not only did they assault a veteran with a deadly weapon  they used his credit cards at locations should nt be too tough to find them fuck these kids,8
81704,this is a pretty typical mugging the mugger aggressively asks you a question  and regardless of your answer they either beat you or ask for money sometimes it s shit like  do you care about the homeless   and if you say  yes  then they aggressively ask for money and if you say no they get upset and threaten you and say you are a liar if you say no  they threaten to beat you or they just get violent either way  you are going to end up giving them your walletmoney another common one is asking you for a cigarette if you do nt have any  they will accuse you of having one and not giving it to them because of some stupid reason  racism  greed  etc  and then get aggressive and demand money for a pack of cigarettes whenif you pull out your wallet they will just grab it and walk away or beat you and run  i was on a bus and had a guy ask for my cell phone to make a call  when i said no  he said i was a racist because i assumed he was going to steal it made a big scene and stood up and got in my face and started slapping my head until i gave him the phone then he got off the bus  same principle with this happens all the fucking time if they get caught they usually say shit like  oh he gave it to me  i did nt steal it  scumbags only reason this one made the news is because it was a war vet,9
81705,pieces of shit who ve done nothing but take from societ,8
81706,i hope that the assailants rot in prison,7
81707,from the daily caller article  gt   i believe this was a hate crime and i was targeted because of my skin color   marquez told the dcnf  too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the main stream media refuses to report on it  woah there racist  only black people can be the victim of a hate crime  now take your beating and shut the hell up about these underprivileged disadvantaged teen youths,8
81708,i m sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case,8
81709,lock these shitheads up and throw away the ke,8
81710,black lives do matter these teens  lives  however do not,9
81711,every fucking time a cop shoots a black guy  justified or not  we have people like obama telling us we have to do some  soul searching  and when cities like dc and baltimore  i live around both and can personally attest that shit like this happens all the time and is usually never reported  and detroit and new york and such have this shit happen  it s a non issue  fuck all of it  trump 201,8
81712,do white lives matter to blacks,6
81713,i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold  it s really political blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims  and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws  and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm  how much power do the sjws really have  will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution,8
81714,and people try to tell me that what celebrities do and say is not important at all on some level  in some instances it is  this is the movement beyonc  tried to shove into everyone s face at the superbowl just remember that,8
81715,best optionavoid dc because it s a shit hole,7
81716, across the street from the fbi headquarters,6
81717, do black lives matter if you do nt agree we ll beat and rob you   and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement,8
81718,i would like to remind everyone that bernie sanders has aligned himself with and defended the black lives matter movement in many of his speeches he talks about sandra bland  michael brown  eric garner and in typical fashion blames racism and the white establishment sanders never once mentions the blacks that are home invading in indianapolis  kansas city  atlanta  etc he never once talks about the blacks that have shot at and killed police  most recently a 19 year old black man shoots an officer in mississippi black lives matter and politicians like sanders are waging that the future will be less white and in that future you folks can imagine who will be the most vile and racist  edit  from today  white house tweets shoutout to grammy winner of best rap album  still no word on recent spate of cop killing,9
81719,let s see if this gets labeled as the hate crime it very clearly is  who am i kidding  that wo nt happen,8
81720,i do not think that black lives matter more than anyone elses if anyone else does  they do nt understand what equality is fuck blm,8
81721,i need to start carrying my gun more often i have my ccw  but rarely do i carry because i dont see the need i just acquired it because its my right to have one,7
81722,what s weird this is nt a bad part of dc at all given  any mcdonald s you go to in this city is likely to be crawling with some of the world s worst  but still,6
81723,yeah beating a man and robbing him is a surefire way to get your point across right,6
81724,black lives matter is to racial equality what isis is to islam both these groups attract those who wish to have power over others  not to enlighten others i hold both in low esteem,7
81725,the sooner they get recognized as the terrorists that they are  the sooner they can be dealt with with boots in their necks,8
81726,do black lives matter or do all lives matter,7
81727,black lives matter  to who,8
81742, men who might be in their 30 s   real helpful description,7
81743,i got hit by a car in a parking lot once i punched the car really hard just so the driver realized he was hitting me it had nothing to do with challenging the driver to a fight or whatever,5
