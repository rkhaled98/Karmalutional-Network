corruption of public officials in michigan  no way ,9,
i certainly do nt necessarily agree with public funds being used for a sports stadium  and i definitely do nt agree with nepotism  but i think criticizing mike illitch somehow taking advantage of detroit is a shortsighted mistake had it not been for mr illitch pretty much singlehandily reinvesting in a city everyone wanted to leave behind over the last 20 years  the city would nt even be close to back on a path to relevancy  whether you want to believe it is or not   the other thing to consider is that this new complex not only brings commerce to an area that was a combination of blight and open fields  it also brings quite a few jobs to the city  as well as some stateoftheart buildings that will bring commerce and international travelers to the area for a variety of reasons  conferences  concerts  etc   this all equals more money for the city of detroit  which is why they re willing to make the investment in the first place   and another part of a blightfilled neighborhood updated and usable for the future  this is a sticky situation that reeks of an unfortunate quidproquo  but when it comes to what is good for the city of detroit  it s hard to argue that anyone has anything on the passion and dedication of mike illitch ,9,
how in the fuck are there no comments about the red wings owner s hair   ,9,
everyone talks about the insanity in pro sports these days  yet no one mentions  public or private  universities  which are all nonprofit  spending massive amounts of their cash on stadiums  athletic facilities  etc it s the same thing if the universities are public  and its only marginally different if they re private the reason they have that money in the first place is federallysubsidized student loans ,8,
lol illitch has done more for the city of detroit than any other person in the last 50 years fuck off ,9,
so he did a good job for the team and the owner offered him more money for a better job  happens all the time  kids ,7,
is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit  or ford field  most people would not step foot downtown if it was nt for those two places i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do nt bring forth revitalization like intendedbut the only article i ve read was about stadiums in la and sf ,6,
before you jump on the  why ca nt detroit use the money for things that actually matter  train   here s   http  wwwcrainsdetroitcomarticle20140921news309219990oncostfinancingofwingsarenahereareanswers  an article outlining the finances of this massive project  edit  s  for those not wanting to click  gt  the initial base price is  450 million problems  changes and added amenities could increase that final cost anything beyond  450 million must be paid by the ilitches  gt  the michigan strategic fund will sell  450 million in two series of bonds they will be divided into  250 million in series a bonds that will be backed by property taxes already captured by the downtown development authority the  200 million in series b bonds will be backed by the  115 million olympia development has agreed to pay the dda for bond retirement  gt  the ilitches  through olympia  will pay  200 million of the bond debt detroit s dda  via its property tax capture ability  will pay back  250 million of the bonds new yorkbased merrill lynch  a division of bank of america  which has pledged to buy all the publicly backed series a bonds in the deal it will then sell the bonds to the public dallasbased comerica bank inc will buy the series b bonds backed by olympia s money the bank  formerly based in detroit  has the naming rights to comerica park  where the ilitchowned detroit tigers play comerica intends to keep the bonds on its books rather then sell them ,8,
 misleading title   https  wwwredditcomrhockeycomments45xs0mdetroit_contractor_who_negotiated_285_million_ind00vnke   it was state money  not detroit s also  ilitch footed most of the bill himself  or through his company   please research  the district  and see their plans for it before passing judgement ,9,
clickbait no one around here is remotely upset about taxpayer funds going to a new stadium for the most popular team in town we re not really unhappy about the new development for business and residences that is happening and we re not raising any concerns about the effort to revitalize the city  detroit is climbing out of a hole created by the corruption of influential individuals local business and leaders have been more beneficial in this process than any other group and this stadium  and the district surrounding it are seen as victories in this effort ,8,
ah  a local spin on the old  congressperson becomes lobbyist  setup ,4,
they are literally building new district for the city not just an arena  a whole new district development is what the city needs and frankly  detroit politics have always been just a  wee  bit corrupt,5,
but  guys  come on we need our circuses  what would we do with out national sports  concentrate on real issues  lol  that s no fun  ,5,
at ohio state  the man whole negotiated the deal to sell its parking rights to a private company  campusparc  left to work for them after it was signed ,5,
public money should never be allowed to pay for sports teams unless the team has to pay back the city directly  with interest none of this but businesses will benefit  bullsht it s my fucking money you re stealing  i do nt want to  potentially  subsidize businesses downtown ,8,
if you re a bernie supporter  who thinks a public funded  1 trillion dollar infrastructure package is a good deal because jobs  but is outraged by the state of michigan investing  285 million in the renovationrevitalization of its  largest city  then you might want to reexamine one of those positions ,7,
for all the people complaining about spending the money on the new stadium and  less mentioned  surrounding developments  all i can say is it will be more than worth it if it fixes up that area governments of all levels have been dumping money into the cass corridor since the early days of johnson s great society programs with any luck this will finally be a solution that sticks,7,
itt  out of staters have no fucking idea about the current state of economics in detroit and how great this project is going to be for the city  i do nt even know where to begin with this article it s clear the author did nt talk to a single person in the city or state or even try to get a feel for the public opinion on the topic including garbage clickbait phrases like the previous article titled  detroit scam city  how the red wings took hockeytown for all it had  has to be one of the dumbest fucking things i ve ever read  when detroit was at its absolute rock bottom worst  going to joe louis arena was probably the only reason suburban white people would ever go into the city and spend money now mike ilitch wants to build a gigantic urban development project including restaurants  shopping stores    apartment complexes   and oh yeah a brand new stateoftheart arena for one of the most successful hockey teams of all time  they have nt missed the playoffs since before i was born  25 years ago they are a big deal and have been for decades   oh  and it s being built at the exact time there s an influx of young people and new businesses into the the city which will create more upward momentum  yes  the city is helping pay for it the city also got a lot of input on it design  layout  and what additional projects would be built along with the arena this happens in every single city an arenastadium is built i do nt necessarily think that s how it should work but the fact of the matter is that this is how these deals are made and the city absolutely needs projects like this if it wants to continue on its upward trend  also attacks on mike ilitch in this article and this thread are disgusting illitch has been a controversial figure for a long time but his story is like example of the american dream you d see in fiction his parents were poor immigrants  he grew up in detroit joined the marines played minor league baseball for the team he now owns opens up a mom and pop pizza place and creates an empire out of it  gets rich while creating jobs and doing public works projects for the city he grew up in even though it s a complete shit hole mike ilitch has been spending  and yes  making  money in detroit for years mike ilitch was there in the 90 s and early 00 s before there was ever a housing crash in the rest of the country the man is nt a saint but if it were nt for him there would be a lot less charities and projects being invested in now he wants to build a project the city desperately needs with the city s help and input  and he s getting shit on by some dumb ass  journalist  that ca nt get their facts straight  endrant,6,

lansing has actually dealt with this problem and their civil engineers have a solution which is both fast and more costeffective than traditional measures they connect the end of the new pipe to the old pipes so when they pull out the old pipe they simultaneously thread the new pipes into the existing space this speeds up the process and the people in lansing estimate with adequate training  involving them with the process in flint  and hiring enough crews it can be completed for flint in one year ,6,
this whole situation is a national embarrassment  and it makes my blood boil  but what does naacp have to do with city water  is it a race issue as well  i ve never seen the demographics on flint  come to think of it  maybe aspca should get involved  too i bet people are still feeding their pets city water no matter what  edit  i just think it should be about officials   doing their fucking jobs    framing it as a race issue might just come back to bite us  who knows how many towns are discreetly checking for  and finding  elevated lead  should it matter how many african americans live there  if so  how should officials proceed differently  will it result in a process of public relations triage  that prioritizes black communities  public officials just need to do their fucking jobs for the public they serve there s no need to complicate this with race ,5,

they do not care what police do with them  they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them  edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create  that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all  they do not care about you you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle ,8,

what is 10 day weekend work release ,1,
at first i thought this was a reasonable charge  but when i read the article it said that she was actually driving with a flat tire most drunks are smart enough to avoid driving on a flat  this woman is an idiot and deserves a harsh punishment she was intoxicated enough to seriously endanger the lives of others  if an officer had nt pulled her over i m sure she would have caused some serious damage ,0,
that s cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work release,0,
well it s not like you can prove that she was actually intoxicated  so the fact that she was nt punished seems appropriate ,0,

i have been calling the helpline everyday for 2 weeks it is a recorded message saying call back later we are busy just then general va helpline ,8,
the problem with the va  like most other government agencies  is that there is no accountability when you ca nt fire workers who are lazy  negligent  or worthless  you end up with a disfunctional organization filled with lazy  negligent  and worthless people ,7,
i have a pretty easy solution  why do nt overflow suicide calls just get forwarded to the regular suicide hotline  s   sure its probably better to deal with someone specifically trained to deal with service men and women but anyone is better then a voicemail ,6,
that vm box is gon na get overloaded quick,4,
pissing off trained military personnel seems like a dumb idea in the long run,4,
yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country ,4,
it is nt a secret that the va is understaffed that is the biggest issue with the va and if they had more funding for labor costs  they would be in a far better spot ,4,

remember when the va story broke it was really big news and everyone was talking about it and it was front page on reddit  nothing s changed  stories keep coming out about how nothing s changed  but no one cares either because it s not new anymore  or because of politics  or maybe both i do nt know ,1,
can anyone explain why the va is so dysfunctional  in short  i do nt get it it seems like they have tons of money but ca nt get their shit together ,1,

so an illegal escort vehicle gets pulled over and the entire funeral pulls over to raise hell ,6,
gt  reached for comment on saturday  a highway patrol official said the motorcycle driver who was leading the procession was pulled over after attempting to halt traffic in the no 5 lane so that the motorcade could pass  gt  gt  although the officer initiated the traffic stop on the lead vehicle only  and indicated to other members of the procession that they could continue on  some of them chose to pull over as well  said sgt jose nunez  a chp spokesman  gt  gt  the motorcycle driver was cited for illegal lighting  and his vehicle was impounded because his driver s license was not current  according to nunez    gt   it exceeds the bounds of all human decency   said family attorney edward ramsey  an officer has the discretion to stop or not stop a funeral procession if it was me  i would have probably escorted this procession to the burial  he did nt stop the funeral procession  all he did was stop the unlicensed driver that was breaking the law,6,
good the roads are for the living have your moments at the funeral please ,1,
what s bizarre is this concept of  respect  for the dead by parading the corpse around  or what s left of it after it s been embalmed that shit is just fucking weird burn it and get on with it do nt fuck up an interstate just because of your idiotic traditions ,1,
the entitlement attitude of so many americans  gt  if it was me  i would have probably escorted this procession to the burial  your funeral escort was driving without a valid license the chp was correct to pull him over and cite him the rest of the funeral procession was free to continue on but you chose to pull over instead that was your own decision that caused you to be late the funeral  what is so aggravating to me about this is the family will file a lawsuit and probably win they will get to think they are right but they will milk the taxpayers of thousands of dollars ,0,
got ta love reddits horrible bias with facts when it comes to the police ,1,
also cars bad guys use those a lot and the internet also food ,9,

how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99  ,9,
thank you but fuck no it s bad enough carrying around 100s to go buy cars amp  bikes on craigslist  now you want me to carry boxes of 20s   the  100 has plenty of legitimate uses  no need to make things harder for the 999  of the population that s lawabiding ,9,
thats why they got rid of the  500 billand it didnt work so well ,8,
yeah if my big illegal bag of money was heavier  i d totally reconsider all the crime i do to obtain large bags of money it just would nt be worth the hassle ,7,
keep marijuana and cocaine illegal  it s the 100 dollar bills that are the problem ,7,
clearly  100 bills are the problem ,7,
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four  5000 bills instead of two  10000 was too taxing better go straight ,8,
people still listen to larry summers  i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008 or does cnn still think repealing glasssteagall was a good idea ,7,
it s not about stopping criminals it s about controlling peoples money with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically this is what done in europe to prevent  tax fraud  ,7,
might aswell remove any chemicals or equipment in the world that can make drugs aswell larry summers idea is stupid  it would nt just hurt criminals  it would hurt the innocent people aswell ,7,
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the  100 bill it is very popular outside the us ,5,
80  of the money supply being in  100 bills is the key statement this would likely be the first  and easiest  step to killing paper currency this is one of the initial hurdles to overcome  because they do nt give a fuck about it being tough on criminals  come on  when looking to implement negative interest rates ,8,
the thing about secondary labor markets  drugs  gambling  prostitution  etc  is that prohibition is what causes the main problems related to them these are black markets that will always have demand as long as the activities are forced underground by punitive policy  and that demand will always find a way around obstacles  making life marginally more difficult for the suppliers is only doing to make the products more dangerous  not less desirable ,6,
the new blue  100 bills are too cool to replace ,5,
that is the most twisted logic   no more  100 bills  guess i ll stop dealing crack ,5,
okay larry last time we listened to you we deregulated the banks in 1999 nah larry  i m not gon na listen to you ,5,
make it illegal for poor people to ever have cash money so that you can freeze their accounts when their name shows up on the noflylist  eh  they already ca nt buy a car in cash without the dealership informing on them to the feds ,6,
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds    ,5,

scrap larry summers  and get rid of a criminal ,4,
i urge everybody here to watch inside job  it will shock you on how thoroughly corrupt this dude is  along with his buddies on wall street washington now he wants the gov to ban the  100 because of nirp  he does nt give a fuck about criminals using those or tax evasions do not listen to what this turd says ,4,
the only relevance to crime is the idea itself scam to grab more control of your money  bankster shenanigans do nt fall for it ,4,
the banks love this this means less people holding cash and more money that they can use to fuck us over remember folks  the rules are changing so that the money on deposit with banks is legally not yours if there s a bank failure  your money will be used to bail out the banks  the move is simply an extension of the war on cash ,4,
bring back the  500 and  1000 dollar bills dammit ,4,
just legalize crime everybody wins ,5,
fuk this illuminati puppet,5,
the bulk of the value of cash in circulation is from  100 s get rid of cash and the fed can do any crazy policy it wants this is a necessary step towards negative interest rates nobody believes the government gives two shits about money laundering  florida real estate laws and hsbc getting zero criminal charges shows that is not the case ,4,
banksters do nt even use cash oh wait you re talking about the little criminals carry on ,5,
another attempt by the wealthy to outlaw cash our money is nt our money  according to the elite ,4,
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination s,4,
scrap the two  the single  the penny  half dollar and nickel instead ,4,
scrap the drugs too  make them illegal  oh wait ,1,
but they just click buttons on a computer and create and move money around  wait  what ,1,
than how will our government and cia function ,1,
interning theory main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks ,1,
singapore has had the 10000 singapore dollar bill for some time it is still legal tender  but is going to be phased out slowly old notes will not be replaced  this is a calculated strategy by the sg government to comply with international counterterrorism and anti money laundering efforts  but minimising their own vulnerability to regulatory arbitrage ,1,
is nt the  100 bill the staple of american foreign trade  i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like  interestfree  loans  though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes  ,1,
politicians do nt use  100s so how could it harm criminals ,1,
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ,1,
the fed stopped printing any bills higher than  100 in 1945 they began destroying the larger denominations actively in 1969  100 in 1945 is equivalent to  1300 today adjusting for inflation frankly they should be talking about issuing a  200 and  500 bill  if not also a  1000 bill ,1,
larry summers should be in prison  he is one of the architects of the 2008 collapse he also was instrumental in the repeal of glasssteagall the world would be better off without this fool and his dangerous ideas  http  wwwsourcewatchorgindexphp  title  larry_summers,1,
does larry mean wall st criminals  of course not  white male entitlement it s what larry is all about unfortunately obama was dumb enough to bring summers into his administration where he flailed about  lamely attempting to cover upmake excuses as to why the theater burned down in 2008 with the financial  masters of the universe  still inside  larry proved his overall dumbness by predicting 2011 would be  recovery summer   based on nothing  no evidence just his  expert  opinion  there was no recovery in 2011 ,1,
gt  the  100 bill is actually the second most common us bill in circulation  behind the  1 bill  gt  nearly 80  of the  14 trillion of us currency in circulation is in  100 bills much of it is held outside the united states  i m no math magician  but this does nt seem to fit ,1,
yeah  just watch  they will scrap it right down to the 20  anyone who wants to make largeish purchases will have to use electronic accounts that can be tracked  oh yeah   because crime  not  because government needs to track your every move ,4,
this is one of those ideas that seems silly at first but the more you think of it  the more it makes some sense ,1,
larry summers  ladies and gentlemen one of the masterminds of financial deregulation is now proposing another hair brained idea summers  go clone yourself so you can go fuck yourself ,1,
attention  we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash  except pennies   cash is privacy and should be a basic right ,1,
this is stupid  criminals will make due with what ever currency there is  they do nt fucking care and any one who thinks otherwise is a desk jocky looking for something to do ,1,
switch to all coins while you re at it if  100 weighed an ounce   1600 would weigh a pound  1 mil would weigh 625 lbs ,1,
larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone ,1,
how would this effect the bitcoin market ,1,
this is about getting rid of cash  not making life tougher for criminals that way  when the fed institutes negative interest rates  you the lowly consumer will be forced to spend your savings to avoid being charged for saving ,1,
funny thing  today also the eu central bank ceo emanuele prodi announced that 500 euro bills are to be outphased for the same reason apparently american criminals manage to launder money with a bill that s 6 times less in value  is nt this just a global banking scheme to rob us the power over our own money ,1,
yes those evil people in government would love to get rid of cash and make everyone just use electronic money because then  the bank has your money and you only have an iou which they may  or may not  pay you back in the future  look at cyprus in 2013 where people did nt get their full deposited funds back because of the financial crisis  also they can charge you negative interest rateswhich means you have to pay for the bank to hold your funds  and of course if the govt has your money  then they have a great deal more power over you in deciding whether they should be nice and give it back to you or not  this is another reason why bitcoin is good  although they will ban that long before they ban cash ,1,

hmm sounds like portable bitcoin exchange devices would be cool carry a bitcoin wallet in a little  5 raspberry pilike thing with an lcd display  hook it up to another  punch in transfer codes  both devices show  are you sure   both people hit yes  see the verification displayed  and bill sizes become irrelevant and everybody can keep negotiating with cash when buying motorcycles off craigslist no matter what these control freak asshats try to pull ,0,

tl  dr  apple has to provide the means to extract encrypted data from the device fbi will then try to decrypt it  i assume by brute force  would would be easy for a 4digit pin   the interesting part is that the device is owned by farook s employer  the san bernardino county department of public health had they been following proper device protocol  they would already have administrator access to it  this was literally government property used for terrorism  and now unsearchable not due to the  encryption  boogeyman but their own ineptitude ,7,
gt  the judge ruled tuesday that the cupertinobased company had to provide  reasonable technical assistance  to the government in recovering data from the iphone 5c  including bypassing the autoerase function and allowing investigators to submit an unlimited number of passwords in their attempts to unlock the phone apple has five days to respond to the court if it believes that compliance would be  unreasonably burdensome  so it sounds like the government does nt think apple can bypass it for them  just make it easier for them to brute force i bet judge s ruling will hold up  too ,5,
apple  you are hereby ordered to factor the following data into its prime numbers  or be found in contempt ,1,
so more than two months later and they are still farting around getting information that could be important in preventing future actions  wtf ,1,

comcast   so what  it s not like you can leave me ,9,
comcast is used to pissing people off they wo nt give a fuck ,9,
you could probably just sticky this post  have no link from it or replies available that is how permanent of an issue this is ,9,
if a telephone company has this large a problem  they have to meet with the fcc and show cause most likely there would also be a hefty fine but  not cable networks because they are deemed nonessential ,8,
not news to me i have a 3 hour outage at least once a month with comcast a 1020 minute outage daily around 56 am  and at least 34 10 minute outages sprinkled throughout the week  i know this because 2 out of every 5 or 6 dvr recorded shows are fucked up during the middle   absolutely awful i live in a moderate city  too  so it s not like i m in the middle of fucking nowhere ,7,
and then they wonder why people are ready to go to google fiber,7,
loss of internet and television access for 3 days would cause mass panic and riots,9,
my bad people i went over my 300gb and used way too much of an infinite resource ,7,
wow  17k outages nationwide for as much as 3 hours  obama needs to step in and fix this for sure s,9,
gt  across us i bet i could find thousands who are angry at comcast  in my town alone  ,6,
i m fully expecting to get downvoted to hell here  but what the heck  i m not particularly fond of comcast  but unless i missed something here  which is entirely possible   this does nt actually sound like it was particularly horrific for people in general it sounds like a very small fraction of their nationwide customer base  had an outage of parts of their service for about 3 or 4 hours  not even all of their service  but things like they could nt access their hd channels  or their internet did nt work for a few hours  i understand for businesses  an internet outage can be a big deal  so some outrage on their part would be justified  but for the general consumer  come on  get a grip go read a book for a while  or go outside for a bit  or  gasp  go do something with your family  i m just not getting what the huge deal was here  what am i missing ,7,
i was part of the outage did nt have internet and only had access to about 8 sd channels i ll be honest  3 hours where i have to use my phone for internetsi could nt care less had to go out and shovel anyway  edit  couldgt  could nt,7,
not a fan of comcast  but with this outage they probably still provide 9999  uptime bunch of whiners  yes  i work in it ,6,
i like how this is news in this country ,7,
comcast angers me even without outages ,7,
the words  anger  and  comcast  come up often ,5,
there needs to be legally mandated uptime and speed requirements  95  of the time your connection must reach the  advertised  speed  no more  up to xmbps  allowed  and 99  of the time it must reach 14 of that speed if this is nt met then customers must be completely refunded for that month ,5,
is anyone else still completely fucking down  just everything  been down for 15 hours here ,5,
quote from the article   comcast has more than 27 million customers  and 89000 of those are new cable subscribers the company signed on last quarter that was its best performance in eight years  correct me if i m wrong but are nt there 2 choices for most people  sign up with comcast or do nt have high speed internet  it s like bragging because people choose to eat food from the only supplier rather than starve to death ,5,
comcast seems to be an isp that people love to hate  charter got so bad for so many years that i loved to hate them in all honesty  the past three to four years or so they have been great ,7,
customer service replied   working as intended ,4,
i ve had comcast xfinity for almost 2 years now and i ve never had an issue ,6,
fun story i was at a friend s place watching the superbowl in denver comcast blacked out cbs with 1 minute 26 seconds left on the clock in second quarter  and service was nt restored till about 15 seconds before 3rd quarter kicked off  idk how widespread this was but lots of denverites did nt get to see the super bowl halftime show i d imagine comcast would lose a lot of money if their advertisers paid to have a certain amount of views and one of the biggest markets  since denver was participating in the super bowl  cut out all views during the entire halftime show idk how their whole contract with that stuff goes though  i hear i did nt miss much though ,4,
that s what happens things go out sometimes ,1,
friend of mine called to ask why he couldnt connect  he obviously cant check if there are outages in his neighborhood without the internet  he calls them and they offer to send a tech to his house for like  80  they didnt tell him the price  but you know itd be up there  he spends an hour checking all his connections  digging through paperwork to find his modem settings page  finally calls back about 8hrs later hoping to talk to someone else and theyre like   oh yeah  there s an outage in your area   idiots ,5,
when i called  i was disconnected 3 times this is great customer nonservice beside the lack of tv thanks comcast for helping me make my change from you  easier ,1,
it s nothing new that comcast absolutely sucks ,4,
when you deal with technology  there is only one thing i can guarantee you it will get down at the worst possible time ,1,
 compact angers thousands across the us for something other than just being comcast for once  ftfy,1,
they just put a data cap on my home internet how fucked is that  pretty fucked if you ask me ,1,
what is the most troubling about comcast is that when there is an outtage  it doesnt effect just a small region  but instead downs multiple states that seems so rediculous ,1,
once they fix the outage you re left with  comcast anger thousands across us ,1,
now only 1000 years to lrrr ruler of the planet omicron persei 8 comes to destroy earth ,1,
it s not like we re losing  that  much more bandwidth it s only like 20 megs less than what we had before which was only 80 megs less than what we re paying for ,1,
so  i had to get comcast recently because i moved and noticed something weird about my bill the letter in the mail has a different due date than the due date that shows up on the online account just saying folks make sure to pay 2 days before your date at least ,1,
just having comcast in general makes them angry ,1,
 nsfw how comcast really feels   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  kmcny_pixdw ,1,
once in a while fios is out for a few hours hard to get too pissed  these things do happen i do nt think comcast needs an outage to be hated honestly though for me they were a decent provider  i never had a single issue with them except for the occasional outage ,1,
wow now that s comcastic ,1,
it was out for like 3 hours jesus christ ,1,
my comcast service  for the first time in years  has actually been pretty good lately but i d like to pay less  so i m rooting for google fiber to come to boston simply so i can reap the benefits of competition  i mean  that s what we really want  right  we do nt want yet another monopoly  no matter how  altruistic  we think google will be  we want the existing monopolies to be forced into providing quality service for a reasonable price  along with other choices ,1,
it probably still worked better than my centurylink dsl,1,
comcast s response   it pays the restoration fee  or else it gets the hose again ,1,
my case  as in many others  boils down to this  you can pay triple the amount for the same throughput speeds or you can curse comcast and wait for google fiber ,1,
at the same time  i would nt want to be on the other end and get screamed at from 10k  people experiencing the outage i just went out instead of being at home it s aggregating that it happens so often  at the same time there are other things to do,1,
they should just switch providers if they are nt satisfied  see what i did there  ,1,
after this comcast will just be turning off their services everywhere after all  they could save a ton of money that way ,1,
for comcast  it was tuesday ,1,
spread your cheeks  most of you wo nt even complain or ask for a billing credit ,1,
title should just be  comcast angers thousands across us   i fucking hate comcast with every fiber of my being  reasons  i  paying top dollar for slow as shit internet  ii  a modemrouter combo that broadcasts an unsecured public network from your home which has to be manually deactivated  iib  said modem has to be forced reset once a week  and doing so undoes the manual changes you made to get rid of the second network  iii  arbitrary data caps  iv  live television that freezes  v  ondemand that works infrequently  and turns into minecraft porn when it crashes  vi  customer  service  that refuses to listen to what your problem is  but instead tries to upsell you on a more advanced package  one of my dreams is to live long enough to see this shit stain regional monoploy of a company implode upon itself  or be run straight into the fucking grave by google fiber ,1,
i always laugh at this shit until i remember i m with twc  the   second   worst rated isp in america ,1,

i do nt know how these people live with themselves ,6,
i wonder how long it will be until they open another one ,4,
sad that a majority of these are cancer related hopefully karma will catch up to them ,4,
i know it is a reach but why do these people need to make high salaries it is a charity you are supposed to be doing something good for other people if pay is needed then just like congress no more than 80k you are performing a service for people  10 of those charities involve the police the nickel tin mafia have their hands in all kinds of money making rackets ,1,
funny how employers get to steal from employees  and if they are caught  they simply have to repay the employee what they are owed nobody gets charged  nobody goes to jail  meanwhile  if an employee steals from an employer  they get charged  fined  and probably spend some time in jail ditto for customers who steal  i wonder why people hate the government and rich people ,8,
hopefully australia has a similar thing to the usa where prisoners are paid like 47 cents per day ,6,
not as bad as actual slaves that work in unpaid internships ,5,

personally working as security guard in a hospital  and having to deal with people who have mental health issues its not fun  or safe and generally the actual hospital staff is nt very helpful i ve been kicked in the head  punched in the face  and many other things happen sometimes these people can not be handled and tazeing could deescalate the situation ,5,
from what i ve read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops it looks like the taser use was justified sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca nt be deescalated otherwise  has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ,7,
this is unacceptable tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are nt ,7,
he died 5 days later at a different hospital  clickbait headline i m sure we ll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death ,7,
well at least the officers saved the victim from harming  himself  ,4,
he died a week later he was also resisting arrest ,4,
officers ca nt subdue people without shocking them to deathstun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only not some wack trying to get mental help ,0,
oh this is lame  his identity has not been released  nor the race of the officers   wtf does that have to do with anything  oh that s right more race bating by the media ,1,
police are to trigger happy they could easily have uses theiroh ,1,

so this guy is innocent until proven guilty right  why is this investigation so short  we do nt know the details  why does it take a year to investigate an officer for shooting someone  and this takes a couple of days to charge this guy  is that disconnect enough to make anyone here question things enough to accept that there is a massive encompassing problem with our legal system  i always have to wonder because we see many of the same people calling for people to wait for details after an officer shoots someone  telling us not to be monday morning quarterbacks then stories like this pop up and we have those same people frothing at the mouth in this situation where it has nt been given the year plus of investigation that an officer who shoots someone would be given the guy is already guilty despite the cries to give officers the benefit of the doubt because of the innocent until proven principle ,0,

from the regressive left s perspective  by censoring and silencing opposing opinions  especially those from sources merely  perceived  as not being   progressive   regressive enough  they are allowing for  traditionally oppressed groups  to   be used as a mouthpiece that ca nt be challenged because of cries of racism   speak  just as long as they say the correct    progressive   regressive things  ,1,
living in germany and studying  i m gon na pay 300   335   for the upcoming semester  these 335  also includes a public transportation ticket  which is in your student id  that allows me to take the train  bus  tram etc at any time as much as i like in my entire state  books are nt nearly as expensive as in the us  the most expensive book i bought last semester was 80   89    but  seriously  95  of the content for the majority of the courses are uploaded on the university s website  files and documents which you can download for free  also  the university canteen offers you decent food for a fair price  normally around 35   in the end my biggest expenses during my semester are the coffees i buy on campus,9,
i m from the uk and have lived in germany for 6 years now i came here with a 20000 gbp student loan for a 4 year degree in computer science  now i m about to start a masters in web science that will cost me about 1000 eur for the 2 year course  parttime and remote  i m also just about to get german citizenship  most germans are happy to speak english  i have a job here and although most of the company speak english they make i point of speaking german with me  and i with them  i m not very good at german but am slowly learning now after 5 years of being very lazy about learning the language it s a very hard language to learn  screw those articles   but in time you ll get used to it  i absolutely love speaking to locals in german and being understood by them  to me it s like being on another planet and finally being accepted by the local populus  good luck to anyone who wants to come over  it is a wise move  come and see me near koblenz ,9,

come gather around the fire and listen to a tale of a spooky and simple explanation of our increasing tuition rates in the us  the government started giving student loans kids take the debt  the schools get the money tuition prices increase because they can rely on the kids to get a gov loan take away student loans  then schools ca nt rely on this money  kids ca nt afford the jacked up tuitions  enrollments drop  schools are forced to cut tuition  now more affordable again it s the same problem with mortgage crisis  just a different industry ,9,

something like this gets posted everysingleweek without fail and then a bunch of americans start making hasty decisions to just go study in germany because it s  free   oh and it has been this way for years so it is nt a new thing  the german courses that you will have to take for at least a year to reach fluency are around  300 a month and noduolingo is absolutely not enough to get you to the level you need to study at university  the fees for applications are at  75 then an additional 15  for each university you apply to after the first it can go well into the hundreds  the bank account you have to open for your student visa has to have a frozen amount of at least approx   8500 this is nt to say it is impossible but do nt expect roses and rainbows and raining beer amp  wurst to await your easy university life in germany  also american universities except the few ivy leagues or outstanding schools  baby the absolute shit outta you you can pretty much sail smoothly your first two years while you get your core courses out of the way in germany  you jump right into it in german remember  a different language a crazy  difficult language at that the high school diploma is also not equivalent to the german one that allows you to study at a university the equivalent would be a plethora of ap courses with really good grades or a high school diploma plus two years of college with really good grades and then you re equivalent to a german high school graduate  you will also most likely not be able to transfer credits  german bureaucracy  a bitch you will have to have german knowledge when applying for your visas or someone to be a translator there with you  you may have to do a prep year for certain programs as well it is also very competitive to get into even these programs  i sound like fucking scrooge but i ve been through all of it as so have many people i met along the way  it is possible but it will take a lot of hard work and dedication and time that you wo nt regret  losing  because it may not work out perfectly you may get rejected you may not be accepted for that semester a lot of the popular programs have a cap so it s very restricted in terms of amount of students accepted  do nt expect germany to be a country that is just waiting and fiddling its thumbs for the americans to come and study in their unis for  free  and think that they re gon na make it easy for you it is anything but ,9,
my american husband started learning german at the age of 26 a year later he was admitted to vet school here he s almost finished now we ve been paying 120 euros a semester i think he s the only foreign student to not drop out in his class though the drop out rate is high even for germans while he s happy he is debt free  the immense stress of having to learn a very hard subject in a foreign language and a foreign system  bureaucracy is insane here   have caused many panic attacks and one major case of depression and he has nt even started the huge final exam yet but at least we wo nt be  200k in debt when this is over ,8,
the fee is actually 150500  per semester books inclusive because of librarys and because we live in 2016 and share digitaly public transport also free  you get 600  per month plus health care  if your parents arent rich  this will be checked by government  as student  and will have to pay back   half of that   in worst conditions after you finished  also  after 3 semesters you must have passed 23 of your finals at any time to get your  baf  g  money  but this will only be checked once no money for extra semesters of course ,9,
in my opinion let them come here  let them study here and let them stay here if they want besides the fact that the ones who stay make up for the cost of education it is a great way of cultural exchange  it s always nice to have friends from different countries  so if you are coming to the area of n  rnberg just text me  ,8,
currently living in duisburg  germany and studying at the university of duisburgessen   my choice   i grew up in the us  but my parents are from germany after graduating high school it became apparent that studying in germany was an opportunity that i could not pass up i chose my current uni because it has an international studies in engineering program which allows me to pursue a bachelors degree in computer engineering with the first year taught entirely in english   costs   the costs are definitively low the semester fee  including public transport  is below 300   my total living expenses are below 700  a month and that includes health insurance   my experience so far   keep in my mind i m still in my first semester  as others have mentioned before  the majority of students quit after the first year last year  the failure rate of an exam taken by 200 students was over 95   attending lectures is completely voluntary and there is one exam at the end of each course that makes up 100  of your final course grade no homework is given and you are very much on your own forcing yourself to focus and learn everyday can be a serious challenge  feel free to comment or pm with any questions ,7,
many american students also come with very false expectations about what german university is like you have to be way more self organised and please do nt expect multiple choice tests ,9,
we need to stop this immigration because when america sends its people  it sends unskilled people and we have to spend our money on them we are going to build a wall  get america to pay for it and make germany great again ,9,
you can only offer something for free if you limit supply fewer germans go to college than us students   only 30  of germans ages 2534 have completed a tertiary education  which includes academic degrees and some but not all vocational programs that  s below the oecd average  and below the us 45  attainment rate for the same age group  http  wwwlatimescomlocaleducationcommunitylameedufreecollegeeducationingermanybutnotincalifornia20151029htmlstoryhtml edit  so now i am amused that many people are suggesting that fewer people should go to college in the us  presumably other people  not so much themselves they are smart   it seems like this would be a less popular proposal than promising free tuition ,9,
gt  police told local media they still don  t have a motive  assisted suicide would be my bet,7,
my initial reaction was  what the fucking fuck     but on second thought  assisted suicide would be a reasonable motive old people with terminal diseases should nt be forced to live out their last few months or years in suffering if they do nt want to ,1,

interesting though   since 2005  texas has prosecuted 38 juveniles for intoxication manslaughter or intoxication assault only three were sent to the adult system  and half of all cases resulted in probation of some kind  i think this is more telling of the justice system  and accessibility to competent  quality counsel it s clear money buys better legal counsel  but if the government subsidized public defense more heavily  the outcomes would clearly be different ,9,
cash is king in the world of corruption ,9,
i said this somwhere else  but it s also pertinent here  everyone is equal under the law and money is how we measure that equality ,9,
the difference  money ,9,
it s almost like the rich live under different rules ,8,
this is standard practice in the us judicial system outcomes will vary from case to case depending on financial status there s actually a legal term for it  it s called   cream  ,9,
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich ,8,
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law this is the american dream ,8,
and liberty and justice for all  who can afford it  ,6,
i love how this article just glosses over the fact that arellano had previous dui convictions which is why he did nt receive the same sentence  this was couch s first dui case which is why he got probation  as texas takes the rehab route  but whatever lets rage and ignore the facts,8,
is everyone here honestly  seriously shocked that money gets you out of trouble  am i taking crazy pills ,5,
going beyond the dae legal system is corrupt  circlejerk in this thread  there are certainly some differences in these cases firstly  the arellano case  the other one in the article  happened in 2007  six years before couch s trial likewise  the article says that arellano had driven while intoxicated and drank underage before  which means that he would ve had a greater chance of being moved to an adult trial meanwhile  couch had no prior violations of the law  meaning that he could nt be moved to an adult court ,7,
i understand what you are trying to do with your anecdotal case comparisons however  they are nt comparable cases when you consider all the factors  including criminal history  but  even if you ignore all the other factors  i know of a white 20 yo male from a fairly wealthy family in my area who was sent to prison for a year based on a drunk driving accident so my anecdotal evidence shows similar punishment to your anecdotal case thereby anecdotally refuting your point ,9,
the real crime here those eyebrows,6,
gee  it s almost like different judges and prosecutors in different areas with separate cases can lead to different verdicts or something ,7,
that s why the case became famous because he got away while guilty that was autocorrect capitalization ,5,
affluenza is just a fake term that means the following  if you are rich  you do nt go to jail if you are not  you will spend 10 years like 95  of americans ,5,
let s be clear what happened to the poor kid was what s supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone you fucking go to prison couch was the exception ,7,
he did nt go free he was on probation and then he violated that  so he s going to jail ,8,
law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening ,4,
if someone is brought up too rich to not know the difference between right and wrong  why can the same argument not be used for poor people who commit crimes  people who are brought up in poverty do nt really know right from wrong just as much as a kid who has rich parents ,4,
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time ,4,
  sees title   probably not a rich white kid   clicks article   and yuuuuuuuuuup smh,4,
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win ,4,
obviously as white god intended ,5,
i fucking hate ethan couch  i mean look at that look on his face disgusting i mean even his name is stupid ,6,
horrible headline  38 cases of dui manslaughter in texas since 2005 and only 3 of them went to adult court  that tells you the vast majority of these cases are handled with kid glovesso picking out one of 3 that went the other route and comparing it to the affluenza case is disingenuous  but fuck it  that is what the media does today god forbid they instead do an article focusing on how in texas if you are a drunk driving kid that kills people you will get away with it 35 out of 38 times,4,
it did nt seem to mention how they had the same judge  we ve already established this same judge would have been open to giving a similar sentence to a poor minority because she tried to do just that keep making this a race issue  though lord knows the media loves to stir up ignorant poor folks  also  anyone who comes to the us illegally and kills is citizens deserves little sympathy he was a juvenile  so it would be appropriate to release him and deport him  i do nt understand the need to distort issues to make tbem about race we already have enough problems it s already an established fact that those with the means to afford a lawyer fair better than those who do nt ,4,
the difference  money ,5,
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ,1,
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ,1,
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did ,1,

well  on one hand you have a kid that killed 3 adults and a child in a crash  and on the other a kid who killed a mother and her  unborn child  in a crash in a conservative state so he could have mowed down 10 born people and probably got less than what he gets for  accidentally  killing 1 unborn baby ,1,
free public defender vs 2000  an hour lawyer ,1,
this affluenza thing still baffles me  doing bad things because money  with that sort of logic hobos must be saints and not the crack heads living under bridges ,1,
no shit  i mean was nt the entire outrage that similar cases normally lead to prison in the first place ,1,
seriously  the rich kid ,1,
that s what  affluenza  means literally the entire point of this case and why it s been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ,1,
i say it like my grandma used to  money talks  bullshit walks ,1,
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows wtf ,1,
there s actually a legal question that you asked ,1,
you do nt automatically get a dui in fact ,1,

for those of you incapable of rtfa before making racist comments  the bride and groom are actors hired by a charity to raise awareness and the 37000day statistic refers to child marriages estimated worldwide not specifically in this local area ,9,
gt  nearly 15 million girls  some as young as eight or nine so  some as young as eight ,9,
37000 child marriages every day  if that s the case why are these people shocked  surely they must see these pedo photoshoots on the reg ,9,
these statistics seem unreliable estimated 12 billion new child marriages by 2050  even taking the 37000 a day estimate at face value that would only get you to 500 million by 2050  i mean seriously  assuming population growth rates remain unchanged  unlikely as the rate is slowing significantly  there will only be  47 billion women born under the age of 8 by 2050 is it truly believable that a quarter of women born in the next 34 years are going to be placed into a child marriage ,8,
ok this is a serious issue  but fuck the misleading clickbait title ,8,
paid to act and still goes for the hoverhand ,5,
as young as nine nine years old damn ,5,
i doubt half the people even read the article and thought the video was real they were actors and were stopped by plenty of people who called them criminals ,6,
i just wanted to point out the hand hover,1,
where in lebanon was this  looks a bit like beirut if so  i can understand the mixed reactions i would wager the reactions would be less mixed in the northern or southern regions ,1,
i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country it s picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual some of them just do nt realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do ,1,
eh personally i m more concerned with men sitting with their legs spread on public transportation that s the real problem ,1,
at that rate the entire female population of the us would be married off in 11 years certainly 37000 child marriages a day is unsustainable or maybe it s media hype ,1,

what wrong with this prophet mohammad had sex with a nine year old child  prophet is perfect do nt be blinded by secularism  thats what an apologist would say and its true the prophet liked them young,0,
pakistan tried to pass a law banning child marriages and the clerics said   nope  the koran says as soon as a girl menstruates  she can be dtf whoever she s married to  so you re not allowed to pass a law like that  so they took it back and child marriage continues to be legal ,0,
ignorant people get morals from a stupid book that is nt moral,0,
no one cares it s over there,0,
these clickbait titles are getting out of hand ,0,
are these the people you want flooding your country on a daily basis  are these the kinds of values that america will benefit from importing ,0,
lol this is nt normal in lebanon and that is clear from the video these people are actors,0,
its funny how the muslims in the video oppose this even though the greatest man that has ever lived  mohammed  has actually married a child around that age ,0,
honestly what s the big deal this is a tradition going back thousands of years why stop it now ,0,
someone post this on rfeminism and see where that fuse leads too i would but i been banned for positing stuff that does nt fit the narrative,0,
i thought this was child to child marriage   still fucked up but at least that s not as bad as this ,0,
once a girl has her period  nature has decided she can be a parent or a bride that s a hard fact for most to swallow nature gives no shits about how our culture has changed ,0,
